"2017-10-16T03:24:00.000Z","2017-10-16T03:24:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Steady As She Goes","<p>Though Dubai and Abu Dhabi might get all the attention as commercial centers, Sharjah's financial sector is slowly growing in prominence. Supported by its robust industrial sector, financial services are becoming an ever more significant part of the Sharjah economy, with foreign investment rising due to investors' confidence in the stability of the Sharjah market. Though the economy has slowed in recent years with the fall in oil revenues that have affected the region as a whole, Sharjah's downtown has been lessened by its well-diversified economy and foreign ties. As the Emirate continues to move forward, industry leaders expect well-structured Islamic banking and foreign investment to become even larger parts of Sharjah's economic profile.</p><h4>UNCERTAIN CLIMATE</h4><p>Sharjah's financial sector must be considered in the context of the larger UAE and Arab financial environment. The UAE, like most other oil-exporting countries, has experienced financial difficulties over the past few years as the price of oil has fallen significantly. According to the UAE Ministry of Economy 2016 Annual Report, public revenues fell 30.3% from 2014 to 2015, leading to a 53% increase in the public deficit. While the most direct impact of this was the decrease in public spending, the private commercial sector was affected as well. Liquidity fell, and demand for credit decreased as major projects were sidelined due to uncertainty about the economic health of the UAE. Larger global trends contributed to this as well; the slower-than-expected growth of the Chinese market (a major source of FDI in the UAE), the rise in the US interest rate, and the economic uncertainty generated by the UK's decision to leave the EU all combined to create a wave of circumstances that affected investor confidence and slowed the UAE's growth.</p><p>Yet, even in the midst of all of this, there were a number of promising signs regarding the financial sector, Sharjah's in particular. The underlying structural health indications of the sector remained strong thanks to good planning during boom years. While profitability has been affected by reduced liquidity, capital adequacy and credit ratios have remained steady, indicating that institutions are cautious about lending but face relatively little risk. International observers have taken notice of the strength of the sector; in a November 2016 report, credit rating firm Moody's kept Sharjah's rating at A3 Stable, citing a debt burden on par with its peers and lower volatility than the UAE because of the Emirates' robust foreign capital controls.</p><h4>SHARJAH PERFORMANCE</h4><p>One of the fundamental challenges facing the banking system of the UAE as a whole is that government deposits make up a significant portion of total bank deposits, exposing banks to liquidity shortages when oil revenues fall. Sharjah, as one of the most economically diversified Emirates, is less vulnerable to this phenomenon than others thanks to its strong industrial base and conservative, risk-minimizing approach. The Bank of Sharjah, for example, announced a net profit of AED58 million in 1Q2017. While this was down 28% over the same period in 2016, a number of indicators point to improved performance in the second half of the year. Loans have been increasing, and are up 8% YoY over the first quarter of 2016, and total assets rose 4% over the same time frame while underlying metrics such as capital rations and net liquidity continued to remain high. Data on the bank's performance in 2Q2017 indicated that it was on the right track, with profit rising 6.2% YoY and total assets rising by 10%.</p><p>In an interview with TBY, Sharjah Islamic Bank (SIB) Vice President Saeed M. Al Amiri explained that the bank's strong performance is due to a deliberate strategy that seeks to minimize risk and emphasize steady growth. “SIB has always been a conservative banking services provider,"" Al Amiri told TBY. “We believe in steady growth instead of huge peaks followed by dropping valleys."" The largest private financial institution in the Emirate, SIB has begun to enter global bond markets in a move that shows the growing global reach of Sharjah's financial markets. SIB issued its first sukuk in 2006 and has since released four more. The most recent was a USD500-million, five-year sukuk that saw orders equal to 3.2 times the size of the issue, generating USD1.6 billion in orders. Only 59% of orders came from Middle East, with Asia accounting for 22% of orders and Europe 22%, a testament to international confidence in SIB and the Sharjah banking sector. The success of the sukuk is even more noteworthy considering the regional context; while Islamic bond issues have become an increasingly popular way for Middle Eastern governments and financial institutions to raise cash, the volume of sukuks dropped in 2016 due to issues with the complexity of the loans. SIB, however, has been praised for its ability to run hassle-free sukuks. Both SIB and the Sharjah government have plans for sukuks to increase capital in 2017, a process that should continue to relieve pressure on the lending markets.</p><h4>INSURANCE INDUSTRY</h4><p>Though small, Sharjah's insurance industry shares many of the same qualities as its commercial banking sector. The Emirate has just two insurance firms, Sharjah Insurance Company (SIC) and Al Buhaira National Insurance Company (ABNIC). Both draw a significant share of their business from government-linked properties, which have given them a steady line of low-risk business. As a fairly well-developed market, there is strong demand for a full spectrum of insurance services, and the two firms combine to offer a number of insurance products. Recent financial disclosures have shown that both firms are in a fairly stable position: ABNIC, the larger of the two, announced a net profit of AED35 million in 2017, up from AED32 million over the previous year, with most of the increase from an uptick in auto premium earnings. Ratings firm CPI financial gave ABNIC a BB+ rating in July 2017, noting that while liquidity remained below desired levels—ABNIC's total liquid assets of AED220.1 million represented 73% of net technical reserves—the firm's debt-to-capital rating was within an acceptable range, capital adequacy was strong, and the firm was overall a moderate risk. SIC, which was the first firm in the industry when it was established in 1970, reported a net profit of AED19.3 million in 2016 and AED9.6 million in 1Q2017. Its assets as of 1Q2017 stood at AED205.9 million, an increase of AED5.2 million over 4Q2016.</p><p>Looking to the future, the guiding principles of stable growth will remain at the core of the Sharjah financial sector. Regional indicators suggest that the price of oil should make a slight recovery through the end of the year, bringing some support to the larger sector by providing for more liquidity through revenues. Foreign activity is expected to increase with improved investor confidence, and the possibility of mandatory health insurance could bring a new wave of activity to the insurance markets. Still, even if the current economic situation persists, Sharjah's financial sector has shown that it has the ability to withstand the storm. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/2bb6f5e9-1d12-4647-8345-e60aead66d1e.jpg","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/headerImages/ec8f2459-8e14-453a-b2be-005a63cf9cbe.gif","","Though the drop in oil prices has affected liquidity, Sharjah's financial institutions are sound overall thanks to conservative planning that has minimized risk and allowed for steady growth even in unstable circumstances.","","Banking","steady-as-she-goes-uae-sharjah-2017","1243","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The GCC VAT Framework Agreement, which will be introduced in all GCC countries at the latest by January 1, 2019, is needed in the face of falling revenues from oil prices; GCC governments have lost around USD300 billion from the collapse of oil prices since June 2014.</p><p>While 5% is little compared to the rates in the 150 countries that already implemented VAT, it is a small revolution in the Gulf, where taxes on revenue, consumption, or individuals are exceptions more than the rule. The rate is purposefully low to prevent an inflationary spiral  and brutal shock on enterprises.<br>The measure is a much-needed one: since oil prices crashed, budgets have remained unbalanced in the region and are still heavily dependent on oil revenues in most countries. In the UAE, oil companies pay about 55% taxes on their income, while foreign banks pay about 20%. The VAT should bring about USD25 billion in taxes per year to the state budget in the UAE alone. Reinvesting the money in the economy will allow diversification and deepen funding for the public sector, two objectives that the UAE has pursued for years, and particularly Sharjah as it has by far the largest industrial base in the UAE. Untying the fate of the economy to the notably volatile price of oil will also stabilize the economy and make it more shock resistant.</p><p>It will also provide a welcome boost to accounting and audit firms. The VAT could create 30,000 jobs in accounting and economist jobs, and the Ministry of Finance is already recruiting tax specialists to prepare for audits and reclamations.</p><p>Of course, it will also create additional costs. Firms will have to use more resources toward preparing for tax returns and hiring, resulting in price hikes that will likely discourage consumers. While the bigger firms have more resources and possibly more experience from markets abroad, smaller firms will face added complexity, particularly because VAT could cause cash-flow issues in the short term, while also possibly impacting tourism and consumption in the short term. But, since the VAT will not apply to most basic products, day-to-day spending for residents should not jump drastically.</p><p>The Ministry of Finance is preparing for the introduction of the tax, and its main challenge will be to make the transition easy. Technology should help detect fraud and ease bureaucratic requirements; furthermore, businesses will be able to register for the VAT online. </p><p>The transition to an entirely different accounting system for most firms, customer scare, and added financial burden are a few of the many challenges of the new tax. But the benefits are worthwhile; the needed diversification of the national economy will bring long-term stability to the economy. The UAE is preparing for a world without oil and making the necessary investments now. While Sharjah, being the UAE manufacturing hub and an already diversified economy, should be more affected in the short term, it is also in a better position to take advantage of the coming changes due to the same factors. In an exclusive interview with TBY, the Director of Invest in Sharjah, Mohamed Al Musharrkh emphasized Sharjah's strategic location in the region and its world-class business infrastructure that make Sharjah a major contributor to the UAE's overall growth. As the industrial and educational hub of the UAE, Sharjah also connects Abu Dhabi and Dubai to the Northern Emirates and is the only Emirate with access to both the Gulf and Indian Ocean, making it a pivotal player in the UAE and the region. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","VAT","instant-costs-delayed-benefits","1338","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, as closely linked as it is with the rest of the UAE and the surrounding region, Sharjah is not immune to the larger trends in the area. The fall in oil prices has impacted economic activity, weakening the Emirate's fiscal position and slowing investment and credit markets. Moving forward, Sharjah will continue to build its industrial base while forging new international connections to generate new sources of FDI.</p><p>After posting outstanding growth numbers over the first decade of the 21st century, falling commodity prices and a resulting slowdown have dampened the UAE's economy. The UAE as a whole posted GDP growth of 3.2% in 2016, and while Sharjah outpaced this slightly with GDP growth of around 4%, this figure was still below the 6% it averaged from 2010-2015. Still, growth is expected to remain around 4% in 2017, according to Moody's, thanks to strong performance in the non-oil sector. Like the rest of the UAE, Sharjah's economic slowdown affected the Emirate's fiscal position. Between 2014 and 2017, Sharjah's government deficit averaged around 3% of GDP, a marked shift from the 1% it averaged between 2010 and 2013. As a result, total debt rose to about 14% of GDP as of late 2016 and continued to rise into the first few months of 2017. Concern about the Emirate's debt level and the rate of fiscal consolidation led credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's to lower its Sharjah credit rating from A/A-1 to BBB+/A-2 in February 2017; the agency cited an expected rise in fiscal expenditures as a significant factor in its decision. Still, if economic growth rises at the level the Sharjah government expects, the Emirate should find its economic status much improved. Sharjah's 2017 budget projects government revenue to rise by 7% YoY, which would go a long way toward reducing the deficit. The government expects revenues to rise due to fiscal consolidation and the 2018 arrival of a UAE-wide value-added tax.</p><p>The rest of Sharjah's 2017 budget reflects the Emirate's economic priorities and the government's belief that growth will come through heavy investment. The AED22 billion budget represents a 3% increase in government spending, with much of this coming from a 7% increase in infrastructure spending. Sharjah's government has long spurred non-oil economic development through public infrastructure investment, and this strategy will continue in the upcoming year. The primary focus for the Emirate's infrastructure projects is building a framework for a healthy and able citizenship that has the tools to compete in a knowledge-based economy. As part of the Emirate's infrastructure improvement goals, the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA) approved more than 8,300 projects in the first six months of 2017. Soon after the passage of the new budget, Sharjah's Department of Public Works also announced USD175 million of waste management infrastructure projects, a USD100 million expansion of one sewage treatment plant, and a USD74 million project that will build a new treatment plant in the city of Kalba. Projects like these, while less glamorous than new construction, are essential to the continued growth of the industrial sector, and the government's willingness to invest in infrastructure like this is a major part of the Emirate's reputation as a well-regarded site for business.</p><p>The 2017 budget also calls for 41% of public expenditures to be spent on economic development, which spans a wide range of projects that generate sustainable value-added growth. Like many other countries in the region, Sharjah wants to increase the share of its economy that is value-added and knowledge-based; unlike many countries in the region, it is already well along the way to diversifying its portfolio. Sharjah's economy is more diverse than the UAE as a whole; real estate and business services account for 22% of GDP, with manufacturing (16%) and retail (12%) also making significant contributions from the non-oil sector.<br>Sharjah's manufacturing sector accounts for almost one-third of the UAE's total manufacturing output, thanks to three free trade zones that host more than 13,000 companies. The government's active recruitment of foreign firms to fill these zones has local and international observers optimistic about the future of the sector; Sharjah's Industrial Affairs Department has projected that the industrial sector's contribution to GDP could rise from its current level of 16% of GDP to 25% by 2025. Beyond just giving investors a location, Sharjah's government has worked to make its free trade zones incubators that can facilitate transfers of ideas across a wide range of enterprises. For example, the Al Saja'a Industrial Oasis (ASIO) is a 14 million sqft center with plots available for industrial production, retail, and mixed-used purposes. Owned and operated by Sharjah Asset Management Holding, the Sharjah government's investment firm, the AED385 million center was designed to provide an ideal location for different kinds of investment by moving industry from the center of Sharjah to a site with dedicated infrastructure and transport facilities. The center is expected to create up to 21,000 jobs when fully developed, making it one of the pillars of the Emirate's economy.</p><h4>TOURISM</h4><p>Tourism and tourism-related services are also a significant part of the Emirate's economy. The UAE is a crowded market, but Sharjah has become adept at using its comparative advantages to draw foreign visitors. Designated the Cultural Capital of the Arab World by UNESCO in 1998, Sharjah's status as a center of Islamic art and culture has given it a unique identity. The Emirate is home to one of the most significant collections of Islamic art in the world held in over 20 museums. 2016 saw 1.8 million guests visit Sharjah hotels, a 17% increase over the previous year, but the Sharjah government has ambitious plans to deepen ties with key Asian markets and thus make tourism an even more significant part of the Emirate's economy. As part of its Tourism Vision 2021, Sharjah has set the goal of raising annual tourism to 10 million visitors per year by 2021. The Asian market is key to meeting this goal; 2016 saw Asian visitors rise by 12% to trail only the GCC as the largest source market for visitors. To raise awareness of the Emirate's offerings, Sharjah officials are using preexisting business connections to generate both FDI and new tourism flows. In May 2017, for example, Sharjah's FDI office participated in the World Forum for Foreign Direct Investment held in Shanghai to promote the Emirate's offerings. Early returns have been positive; Sharjah hotels saw more than 86,000 Chinese visitors in 2016, an impressive 63% increase over the previous year. In the long term, Sharjah's Vision 2021 calls for 200,000 Chinese visitors by 2021, an ambitious goal but one that seems more than doable under the current rate of growth and engagement.</p><p>Sharjah's tourism sector is also awaiting the completion of two major projects that link infrastructure development with the cultural heritage the Emirate is known for. The Heart of Sharjah project is the Emirate's keystone effort; a 15-year restoration project that will restore historic areas of Sharjah and turn them into a hub for cultural tourism. The largest heritage project in the region the Heart of Sharjah is expected to feature a mix of commercial and cultural centers based on the city's traditional Arab culture that will serve as a tourist attraction and a source of stable commercial activity. Through renovating traditional markets and archaeological sites, Sharjah plans to further carve its own niche in the crowded GCC tourism market and ensure the success of the sector for years to come. The construction is being done in five phases and is expected to be completed in 2025; phases currently underway are focusing on restoring existing buildings and increasing walkability and accessibility.</p><h4>TRANSPORT</h4><p>These international links are also making Sharjah's transport sector a key part of the Emirate's economy. Sharjah's port, historically one of the most important ones in the Gulf, was destroyed by colonists in 1820 but has since grown in importance with the rise of the nation's industrial output. Strategically located with easy access to key Asian markets, Sharjah's long-standing relationships with key foreign partners has helped the transport sector become an ever more significant part of its economy. Hamriyah Port, constructed in 1986, is located next to Hamriyah Free Zone, reducing logistical issues and improving the overall efficiency of the industrial zone. Similar setups are in place in the aviation industry. Sharjah International Airport saw a 10% rise in passengers in 2016, with a record 11 million people passing through. The growth comes after heavy investment in increasing airport capacity; in 2014 Sharjah opened a new, AED500-million runway that significantly increased capacity. New daily flights to Mumbai and the expansion of Sharjah-based Air Arabia lines were both also key expansions, with Air Arabia increasing its passenger volume by 14% in the first nine months of 2016. Longer term, the government expects the airport to serve 25 million passengers a year by 2025. More broadly, the growing links reflect the international ties central to the Sharjah economy. The Sharjah FDI office has estimated that the Emirate's total FDI is expected to reach AED1 billion by the end of 2017, which would represent a 15% YoY increase. International ties have given Sharjah an economic base to be envied in the region, with high levels of foreign investment backing a competitive, industrialized economy with much to offer. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/9297daa7-f81c-4fa8-ad78-149351815330.jpg","","","","","","","hubbly-jubbly-uae-sharjah-2017","1337","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Negative foreign media portrayal, in addition to an unhurried approach to reform from within, had contributed to an economy blossoming with sector-wide opportunities, yet hidden behind a veil of misconception.</p><p>It is precisely these issues that the launch of Vision 2030 in early 2016 aimed to address. A broad-based set of reforms intended to accelerate the pace of privatization and economic diversification meant that the Kingdom was, officially, open for business. But open for business also means open for travelers, and that meant liberalizing Saudi's long-time restrictive visa regime. </p><p>Step one was to improve efficiency in existing procedures, explains HRH Prince Saud bin Khalid Al Faisal, the Governor of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA). Spearheaded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and SAGIA, the Kingdom adopted a new mechanism for granting business visas in 2017. Effective January 1, the new measures will expedite online applications for investors to just 24 hours. Specifically, these have been divided into three categories: commercial visas to visit a facility operating in the Kingdom, commercial visit visas for businessmen, and commercial visit visas for commercial delegations.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, Prince Saud explained that this initiative is part of a wider Competitiveness Acceleration Program that coordinates with 52 different entities to improve the local investment climate. “SAGIA's CAP team works on over 200 points to improve the investment climate, be it from a procedural or regulatory aspect. The pace is rapid, with the team quickly and closely engaging with different government entities to reengineer processes. We are benchmarking our approach against global best practices, using around 300 global indicators. All this work has produced clear results. Recently, the Kingdom announced an application system to issue electronic business visas within 24 hours. Investors can expect much more going forward.“<br>Another crucial aspect to the reforms has to do with pricing. In a bid to increase private participation in the visa process, the Ministry of Commerce and Investment announced a series of new rate hikes in late 2016. All tourists—business and religious (not including Hajj and Umrah pilgrims)—will have to pay SAR2,000 for a single entry visa, SAR3,000 for a six-month multiple entry visa, and SAR5,000 for a year-long one.</p><p>To complement this, the Government announced it would start issuing foreigners visas for up to two years (while the previous limit was one year) at a cost of SAR8,000. According to the Commerce Minister, Majed Al Qassabi, the new fees would not deter foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Kingdom, which is actively easing procedures for foreign business in an effort to attract “quality investment.“ Perhaps a strong indicator for this is the decision by the Ministry that these price changes will not apply to applicants from the US or the European Union, while fees for British nationals will only increase slightly.</p><p>These reforms, of course, fall under goals underlined by the National Transformation Program (NTP 2020) and the Vision 2030, which has identified tourism as a key, untapped driver for the Saudi economy. As outlined by the Vision 2030 blueprint, “In the tourism and leisure sectors, we will create attractions that are of the highest international standards, improve visa issuance procedures for visitors, and prepare and develop our historical and heritage sites.“ According to data from the World Travel and Tourism Council, this push by the government is expected to boost the local tourism sector (encompassing both domestic and foreign travel) to USD81 billion by 2026. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Visa Liberalization","the-kingdom-is-open","1490","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-10-11T10:09:00.000Z","2017-10-11T10:09:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Broad and Deep","<p>Education, though crucial to investment in a knowledge-based economy, is also proving to be the biggest strain on public spending—over SAR200 billion (USD53.3 billion) in 2017—and, naturally, is in line for a major restructure.</p><p>Yet, far from ceding to budgetary pressures, the Kingdom's ambitions for higher education are bold, as outlined by Vision 2030. With a notable target to have at least five universities among the top-200 international universities, Saudi Arabia looks to bring international-standard universities to the heart of each major city and town across the Kingdom.</p><p>Ahmad Bin Hamid Nuqadi, the President of the University of Bisha, located in the town of Bisha in the southwest of Saudi Arabia, stressed the pace of restructuring required for such universities to keep in-line with the government's vision and develop in a sustainable way. “The most important part of my job has been to restructure the university's colleges. For example, I found we had three colleges in one with humanities, sciences, and IT disciplines all together. Therefore, the colleges all needed to be restructured and reorganized to put various disciplines in the right place. In 2017, we got approval for the restructuring of the university's colleges. Today, we have 15 colleges, including applied medicine, science, business, humanities, and more. Currently, we have 17,000 students at Bisha University, 80% of whom are female.“</p><p>The historic town of Taif, just east of Mecca, originally hosted a branch of Mecca's Umm Al Qura University. In 2003, the government approved the decision for the town to develop its own independent university—a challenge Taif has relished. Taif University is now a multi-discipline, internationalized institution with 19 separate colleges and three smaller branches in nearby districts. Speaking on the importance of Taif University in developing its communities, University President Hussam Zaman said, “We consider ourselves as a center of civilization and modernization of this city and the surrounding districts. It is about education, introducing new ideas and arts, and presenting new ways of doing business and economics.“</p><p>“In 2005, the late King Abdullah took the initiative to expand higher education. Five universities were established in one decree, one of them being Ha'il,“ explains the university's president, Khaleel Al-Ibrahim. Having seen rapid expansion over the past 12 years, accommodating over 42,000 students across 14 different colleges, Ha'il University has taken great leaps to develop its medical research capabilities, partnering with renowned international leaders. According to Al-Ibrahim, “We have research connections with the likes of Cambridge and Nottingham University, running programs in different tracks of cancer research including working on breast cancer research.“</p><p>In the Kingdom's eastern province is the urban area of Hofuf, with a population of just over 1.5 million. In 1975, the city saw the founding of King Faisal University as a means to develop the area's vast natural and agricultural resources. According to the university's president, Mohammed Alohali, “King Faisal University is trying to capitalize on its geographic location and its proximity to big farms and food industries that are located in this region. We are also focusing on water processes as Saudi Arabia depends heavily on desalination, and we have a college at King Faisal University that examines this practice and also studies groundwater. As for agriculture, we are educating our students on diseases and insects that can affect crops and, thus, the food production chain. Additionally, we have a research center for palm trees, which is specialized in the production of palm oil.“</p><p>The expansion of public higher education providers in the Kingdom has been rapid. From just seven universities in the 1980s, Saudi Arabia today boasts 28 independent, public universities, situated in each of its key towns and cities. In turn, these institutions have created eco-systems of their own, engaging, employing, and developing their local communities, while also attracting the finest Saudi and foreign minds to their doors. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Universities","broad-and-deep","1431","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5583f81d86b7b00e186be187","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-10-11T09:45:00.000Z","2017-10-11T09:45:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Focusing the Vision","<p>ince Saudi Arabia's 2016 launch of Vision 2030, the Kingdom has begun to implement a series of changes to ultimately create a more diversified, less oil-dependent economy. These reforms leave no sector or stakeholder untouched, spanning all industries from finance to tourism. Notably, privatization efforts and a new VAT are beginning to take shape in 2017.</p><h4>Privatization</h4><p>In efforts to privatize the fuel market and spark investment into the capital markets, 5% of state oil company Saudi Aramco will be publically listed—paradoxically a small USD100 billion drop in Aramco's USD2 trillion bucket and the largest IPO in history. This comes as Saudi Arabia was recognized as an economy that strengthened minority investor protections, expanding shareholders' role in company management, according to World Bank's Doing Business 2017 report.</p><p>Vision 2030 schedules the public listing for early 2018,though delays could push this back to late 2018 or even early 2019. Ownership will be transferred to the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's investment arm with stakes already in SABIC and the National Commercial Bank. By transferring shares to PIF, technically investments rather than oil will become the major source of revenue. The privatization of Aramco offers investors an incredible opportunity, and represents the larger goals of Vision 2030 to diversify the economy and prioritize private-sector participation in the Kingdom's economic growth.</p><h4>Taxation</h4><p>On January 1, 2017, Saudi Arabia ratified the GCC VAT Framework Agreement and has drafted a VAT law to be implemented on January 2, 2018. Saudi Arabia is the only country so far to publish its national VAT law, setting the precedent for other GCC members. The VAT is another response to decreased revenue following the 2014 oil-price crash and preparation for a post-oil economy. The 5% tax rate on most goods and services will be consistent GCC wide; however, many specifics, such as zero-rated and exempt supplies, taxation of financial services, and implementation in free trade and special economic zones will vary by country. <br>Businesses with over USD100,000 in annual revenue will be required to register for VAT, and businesses with annual revenue between USD50,000-100,000 have the option to register. The registration process is available online through the General Authority of Zakat and Tax's online filing system, ERAD. As Saudi Arabia will be one of the first countries to implement and enforce the VAT, businesses will need to take immediate steps to comply with the pending VAT law and by laws.</p><p>In further efforts to increase and diversify state revenue, the Kingdom introduced two other taxes in 2017. A selective tax on tobacco by 100% and on soft drinks by 50% is effective June 11, 2017. More interesting, Saudi Arabia is implementing a family levy tax on expatriates, starting at USD26.6 per each dependent of expatriates in 2017, with plans to double the fee in July 2018 and triple in 2019.</p><h4>Business Etiquette</h4><p>A little effort to understand local customs will prove to be highly beneficial for doing business in the Kingdom. There is minimal separation between what is business and what is personal, thus face-to-face meetings are very much the norm, if not a social mandate. Meetings are especially important for building rapport and trust in business relations, sometimes going long and including several glasses of tea or coffee. They may be scheduled loosely; however, they seldom conflict with prayer times. Modest and understated business attire is expected. For men, this means a suit, shirt, tie, and no jewelry. Women are expected to wear clothes covering their collarbones, knees, and elbows in addition to an abaya in public. Just as formal business attire is warranted, so too are formal titles. “Mister,"" “Misses,"" or “Miss"" should be used until invited otherwise; when speaking to government ministers, “Excellency"" is appropriate, and “Highness"" is used for members of the royal family. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","TBY takes a quick look at the must-know facts surrounding the Saudi business environment.","","Doing Business","focusing-the-vision","1205","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an apt metaphor for Sharjah's diplomacy, which heavily relies on its status as cultural capital of the Arab world and books the center of its cultural policy, as the Sheikh himself is a prolific author.</p><p>Recently, HH Sheikh Al Qasimi has embarked on several bilateral diplomatic visits centered on books and cultural exchange. During his visit to the National Library of France, he presented the French translation of his new book. The President of Costa Rica met with the Ruler of Sharjah at the Center for Gulf Studies to foster cultural and scientific links between both countries, during which His Highness presented a copy of another of his books. Finnish Minister of Development praised the balance between development and culture found in the Emirate during his recent visit. In a meeting with the Indian Chief Minister of Kerala, the Minister expressed his wish to open a Kerala cultural center in Sharjah. Similarly, the Armenian president traveled to Sharjah to promote intellectual and cultural exchange between the two countries.</p><p>In the multilateral sphere, Sharjah will be the official guest of honor at the August 2018 São Paulo International Book Fair, one of the largest and most important cultural events in Latin America. The eclectic visits and the partnerships with book fairs around the world are part of a long-term bid to geographically diversify its cultural recipients, which are still mostly Arab and Muslim countries.</p><p>Sharjah was awarded the title of World Book Capital for 2019 by UNESCO after a long lobbying campaign. Its focus on diversifying the audience for books is in line with long-standing Emirati policies of making books more accessible to a wider audience. This is reflected in the coming creation of Sharjah Publishing City and in the annual Sharjah International Book Fair, the third-largest book fair in the world with more than 1,500 publishers and 300,000 visitors.</p><p>Because of its size and unorthodox approach to diplomacy, Sharjah uses its soft power as a cultural powerhouse to strengthen its presence on the world stage, as exemplified by the recently opened Sharjah Media City, created to be a major media hub. Due to its niche diplomatic approach, it works complementarily with other UAE Emirates, particularly Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and helps improve foreign misconceptions of the Arab world and the UAE.</p><p>Beyond books and culture, Sharjah is developing a truly international presence, using its diverse economy and unique geographic position to enhance diplomatic links with other countries and foster international expansion. Cultural policies are used to pull in FDI, and the free zones act as recipients of foreign companies wanting to invest, particularly in the media and culture fields.</p><p>The ever-expanding free trade zones foster further development in the Emirate, while the export rate remains high. The main export recipients are nearby countries, starting with Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Iran, with other emirates coming in fourth position, followed by Iraq. The fact that Sharjah exports more to three neighboring countries than to the UAE demonstrates how strongly it participates in the UAE's economic influence in the region.</p><p>Sharjah's leaders have consistently praised its unique traditional culture as a reason for investments from other Muslim countries and as a factor of the Emirate's attractiveness for foreign nationals living in the Emirate, while using its cultural impact for international influence in a crowded playing field where difference is strength.

In 2016, over 18 million people flocked to the Kingdom's major religious attractions, such as Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina. Experts foresee the number of arrivals increasing to 30 million by the year 2025. According to the World Economic Forum, Saudi Arabia is globally ranked 11th in terms of competitive prices, 55th in terms of cultural heritage, 31st in terms of tourist spending, and first in medical tourism facilities. </p><p>Considering that the vast number of arrivals continues to increase every year, tourism has become the country's second-largest sector after oil and gas, comprising 5.4% of national non-oil GDP in 2016. According to the latest statistics from the Jeddah Chamber, the sector contributes an estimated USD66 billion annually, with 54% attributed to foreign visitor spending. In total, 91% of all tourism spending in the country comes from leisure-related tourism. Meanwhile, USD12 billion is generated from religious tourism alone each year. That figure is projected to rise to more than USD20 billion before 2020, according to the Council for Economic and Development Affairs. Meanwhile, the council also predicts that the number of people coming to perform pilgrimages will double and triple by 2020 and 2030, respectively.</p><p>From 2004 to 2015, the number of hotel rooms in the Kingdom increased from 105,000 to 281,000, while the number of international operators entering the Saudi Arabian market has also been on the rise.

Capital investment in the tourism sector amounted to USD26.3 billion in 2015 and is forecast to reach USD40 billion by 2025.<br>Subdued oil demand has prompted more attention to non-oil sectors of the economy, and the government has taken the opportunity to focus its attention on how to improve the tourism sector. Until now, the government has trained some 31,000 Saudi Arabians with tourism and hospitality skills and employed over 17,600 people in the security field for the protection of visitors and tourists to important sites. As well, the government spends approximately USD14 million per year to preserve historic and heritage locations. The Kingdom is also on board with the GCC-wide Schengen-style visa that would allow entry to all of the Gulf countries with one application.</p><p> Saudi Arabia's Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTH) has also seized on the opportunity to bring some of the country's lesser-known destinations into the spotlight. The SCTH recently launched a sophisticated tourism promotion campaign, one of many steps the authorities are taking to usher in a new wave of domestic tourism as well as encourage visitors to discover more of the country.</p><p>Still, Saudi Arabians tend to travel abroad on holiday rather than spend their vacations taking advantage of the local offering. By some estimates, up to USD20 billion of potential domestic tourism revenue leaves the country every year. The Entertainment Authority is striving to contribute to the growth of both domestic and international tourism through the support and approval of various events around Saudi Arabia. More concerts, festivals, conferences, and performing arts events are slated to begin arriving in the country, coming off the heels of the success of the Kingdom's first Comic Con in 2017.</p><h4>MUST SEE</h4><p>Although known for its significant religious heritage, Saudi Arabia's touristic sites appeal to visitors of any background, especially those seeking some of the world's most ancient architecture and traditi</p><p>ons. There are four UNESCO World Heritage sites in Saudi Arabia, with a number of others under consideration.<br>Masjid al-Haram, also known as the Great Mosque of Mecca in English, is the largest structure of its kind in the world. The mosque itself surrounds Islam's holiest place, the Kaaba, a building at the center of the mosque, where Muslims perform a series of daily prayers as part of the hajj pilgrimage. Every year, the Great Mosque hosts one of the largest gatherings of people in the world. Medina's Al-Masjid an-Nabawi is another stop on religious visitors' list, and, unlike the Great Mosque, can be part of the lesser pilgrimage, Umrah, at any time of year. Referred to as the Prophet's House in English, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi is considered by many to be one of the most peaceful places on Earth.</p><p>Up until recently, visas to Saudi Arabia granted for the reason of pilgrimage controlled where and when pilgrims could travel in Saudi Arabia. Now, officials are working to loosen the restrictions, making it possible for pilgrims to visit previously inaccessible areas of Saudi Arabia after completing points on their pilgrimages. Prince Sultan bin Salman, head of the SCTH, told the press that the commission is working toward promoting archaeological sites such as Mada'in Saleh to pilgrims and leisure travelers alike. Mada'in Saleh became Saudi Arabia's first UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008. “We also have attractions that will encourage tourists to travel much further and to visit other parts of the kingdom,"" Prince Sultan bin Salman said.</p><p>Cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah are high on the list for tourists seeking more urban and diverse experiences, with both offering a blend of modernity and history. Riyadh is a vibrant city with sporting events, historical sightseeing, Najdi architecture, shopping malls, markets, the National Museum, and Diriyah, another of the Kingdom's UNESCO-protected locations. Meanwhile, Jeddah offers a window into local Saudi Arabian culture, with a selection of the country's best culinary options, breathtaking beaches, traditional souks, and six significant museums—excluding the “open-air museum"" of the old quarters of the city.</p><h4>MUST DO</h4><p>According to the Entertainment Authority, Saudi Arabian citizens spend approximately 2.5% of their disposable income on entertainment and cultural activities. With a vision to increase that figure to 6% by 2030, the authority is working to bring a more diverse set of entertainment options to the local population.<br>In addition to functioning as the entity providing licenses for entertainment activities and investors in the country, the Entertainment Authority seeks to boost confidence in the sector and collect data that will help investors make informed decisions about developing entertainment options in Saudi Arabia. “The authority was commissioned in May 2016, along with bylaws that act as a vehicle to start delivering in October 2016. Since then, we basically decided to give people options from day one, in parallel with the strategy development process,"" Eng. Amr AlMadani, CEO of the Entertainment Authority, told TBY. The authority has started piloting various programs to give people entertainment across the country, ahead of formulating a formal strategy. “We look at what people want and what they like, try to establish confidence in investors that events have huge demand in Saudi Arabia, and use all of that to create our recipe for what the entertainment industry will look like and how it will help achieve the vision target to increase family spending,"" AlMadani continued.<br>The authority also aims to become a one-stop shop for transparent licensing in regard to entertainment activities. According to AlMadani, investors should be able to understand government requirements easily, apply without hassle, and obtain the necessary licenses in a short period of time. This in turn would attract more investors, as well as create demand for different types of entertainment in the Kingdom. “Our major milestones are to finalize the sector strategy and publish some of the significant data we have collected. That could help investors understand more about the market as well,"" AlMadani concluded.</p><p>In collaboration with local TIME Entertainment company, the Entertainment Authority approved and licensed Saudi Arabia's first ever Comic Con in February 2017. The historic, three-day event attracted over 7,000 fans of various media and featured venues for both male and female attendees. Other events scheduled for 2017 include a performance by Blue Man group, a comedy play, a poetry recital, and drag racing. Recently, Saudi Arabia hosted a number of WWE wrestling matches for its male-only crowds. In early 2017, the all-American Monster Jam truck show was staged in Riyadh, an event that attracted tens of thousands of people and showcased trucks of up to four meters in height. Branching out into new areas, the Entertainment Authority is currently in talks to open a Six Flags theme park. </p><p>There are also traditional festivals and events that catch the attention of domestic and international tourists. For example, the King Abdul Aziz camel festival draws more than 60,000 visitors each year. In 2017, the month-long celebration of desert culture ran from March to April.</p><p>Such events boost the restaurant and hotel segment in several ways. In addition to filling seats and beds, large events prompt hospitality venues to put on events of their own. Abdulrahman Al Khathlan, Chairman of AHK Group, sees the government taking significant steps that will produce a trickle-down effect for the hotels segment. “Hospitality feels strong support from the government… they are trying to reduce the procedures to establish a new restaurant or hotel,"" he explained in an interview with TBY. “They have also given us more space to create a more welcoming atmosphere for the customers. When you go to a restaurant with family or friends it is not just for food; it is an experience. It has to contain all the elements together; good food, good service, and atmosphere. That includes music and the possibility of live music,"" he emphasized. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/d0e8f8ff-9453-424e-b683-e53d06ce06b1.jpg","","","","To keep domestic tourism revenue from leaving Saudi Arabian shores while attracting more international visitors, hospitality and entertainment players are adding variety to the sector.","","","set-the-stage","1759","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Arabian Peninsula, however, Sharjah has had to deal with fractious relationships between key partners, with the diplomatic rift between Qatar and the UAE the foremost example. As Sharjah moves into the future, the focus will be on strengthening these regional ties while maintaining the international partnerships crucial to its dreams of industrial and cultural economic expansion.</p><p>No stranger to regional disputes, 2017 brought Sharjah a set of circumstances that stood out as noteworthy even for the region. In early June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar, citing its support of terrorism and unwillingness to work with its Gulf neighbors. The dispute resulted in the immediate closure of land, air, and sea border between the two groups and the expulsion of Qatari nationals from the participating countries. </p><p>While the decision was made by the UAE as a whole, Sharjah is impacted in a number of ways. The Emirate's foremost advantages, industry and cultural tourism, are bolstered by a unified region. Sharjah's industrial growth has been fueled by free zones that have become hubs for regional and industrial investment; drawn by the Emirate's welcoming regulation and strong infrastructure, regional and international firms have been flocking to the Hamriyah Free Zone and the Sharjah Airport International Free Zone and enjoying the increased efficiency and economies of scale that these sites have to offer. Still, Sharjah's importance to the UAE's industrial and transport sectors have created new opportunities even within the uncertainty. In June 2017, Sharjah signed an agreement with German energy firm Uniper Global Commodities to make Hamriyah Port a new LNG terminal. Hamriyah was chosen because it was the only location in the Northern Emirates with the infrastructure to handle gas imports. With the first deliveries expected to be completed in 2019, the site is a landmark for the UAE, strengthening Sharjah's position as a stable hub for industry.</p><p>Likewise, Sharjah's tourism industry benefits greatly from a united Arab world. Named the Cultural Capital of the Arab World by UNESCO in 1998, the Emirate saw tourism increase by 16% in 2017 in part due to the government's investment in promotion across the region. The GCC makes up the single-largest bloc of foreign visitors to Sharjah, accounting for 22% of all visitors in 2016. The Emirate is home to 16 museums and is in the midst of a massive development project to turn the old city into a traditional multi-use market, an endeavor that is expected to draw visitors from all over the world but is most appealing to the Arab market. The increased uncertainty in the region, however, threatens to disrupt the flow of regional travel. While the rift is only diplomatic in nature, the potential for economic disruption in the participating countries could lead to lower visitors. Saudi Arabia, for example, sent more than 160,000 visitors to Sharjah in 2016, and internal travel within the UAE accounted for around 216,000 additional guests; any significant changes to economic health of these two countries would be felt throughout the industry.</p><p>A continued look at Sharjah's tourism flows shows the success of the Emirate's diplomatic efforts in further-flung regions. Asia and Europe combined to account for 40% of all foreign visitors to Sharjah in 2016, a marked increase over recent years. The growth of the Asian market, in particular, reflects the principles that have helped Sharjah become one of the region's model economies. Aggressive marketing from both the government and the private sector has raised the Emirate's profile in the Chinese market. The Emirate's strategy has involved active participation in Chinese trade and investment and new services targeting Chinese consumers, and returns have been overwhelmingly positive for both parties. According to UAE state figures, there are more than 4,200 Chinese companies operating in the country today, and bilateral trade was estimated at USD60 billion in 2016. And these flows show no sign of abating; 2017 has seen Sharjah only continue to increase these diplomatic ties, with members of the government's FDI office participating in the May 2017 World Forum for Foreign Development and the Chinese Offshore Summit, held in Shanghai and Shenzhen, respectively. The UAE also participated in China's Belt and Road Forum, which discussed the Chinese government's landmark plan to link developing Asian economies.</p><p>The UAE's position as a key transport point for Asia and the Middle East has also given it an increased prominence on an international scale. In March 2017 Sharjah hosted the sixth International Government Communication Forum, (IGCF), a global gathering dedicated to building platforms for better governorship. First begun in 2012, the IGCF has become Sharjah's annual opportunity to take a leadership role on the global stage, hosting members of the global community in order to establish knowledge transfers to improve the health of the Emirate. 2017's conference was focused on the theme of “Societal Participation and Comprehensive Development"" and featured a number of panels and dialog centered around meeting the United Nations' sustainable development goals in the GCC. More than 2,500 guests watched officials from 17 countries discuss the steps needed to meet Sharjah's 2030 goals. The conference saw the Emirate take a leadership role in discussions on sustainable development. As the Sharjah government's primary international cooperation arm, the Department of Government Relations is at the forefront of events like the IGCF. The department's Executive Chairman, Sheikh Fahim bin Sultan Qasimi, sees events like these as central to Sharjah's overall mission of improving the quality of life of its citizens through continued economic growth. “The Department of Government Relations became a strategic partner at the event to ensure that our international partners can engage with and learn from Sharjah's expertise,"" Qasimi told TBY. “As the center of culture, education, and innovation in the UAE, the Emirate's international reach spans the globe.""</p><p>The international community has reacted positively to Sharjah's new efforts at outreach and dialog. “I am very impressed by the government communication system in Sharjah, how it holds discussions, collects and analyzes new information, evaluates different ideas, and then informs citizens,"" former German President Horst Köhler told TBY. The success of Sharjah's efforts can be seen in its improved relationships with previously underutilized zones such as Europe and Latin America. Cultural and economic exchange with Latin America, for example, has increased in recent years thanks to a concerted effort to expand the Emirate's ties to the Spanish-speaking world. </p><p>On the surface, these might seem like purely superficial events, but Sharjah has demonstrated that it knows how to turn these cultural connections into concrete economic improvement. The Emirate is currently constructing Sharjah Publishing City, the first free trade zone specifically constructed with the publishing industry in mind. Originally conceived in 2015, the site is expected to hold 350 offices over 20,000sqm, becoming the largest book distribution center in the Middle East. By creating a site where Western publishers can gain new access to the Middle East and Western market, Sharjah expects to position itself at the center of a new cultural and economic space. Projects like these are essential to Sharjah's economic future as the cultural center of the Emirates, and they can be directly traced to the Emirate's emphasis on globalized connections and international diplomacy. “Our visibility is supported by our unique role in culture, education, and innovation in the region,"" Qasimi told TBY, and thanks to the continued work of Sharjah's leaders, that looks to remain the case for the foreseeable future. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/c478d431-5fbf-42ef-aff7-7ac2eacf2a27.jpg","","","","Though regional uncertainty has led to strained diplomatic relations on the Arabian Peninsula, Sharjah has been growing into a role as a global leader thanks to its identity as a hub for culture and industry.","","","worldwide-welcome","1512","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Kingdom's expenditures were highest in two sectors: health and education. The government allocated SAR200 billion to the education sector and SAR120 billion to the health and social development sector. Together, they represent 36% of Saudi Arabia's 2017 budget of SAR890 billon.</p><p>Emphasis on the education sector makes sense, especially now. With two-thirds of Saudi Arabia's population under the age of 30 and nearly 1.9 million Saudi youths entering the market within the next decade, education will be the make or break for Saudi Arabia's social and economic future.</p><p>In Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed bin Salman underlined the need for a diversified economy that steers clear of oil and makes way for private enterprise. But Vision 2030's lofty goals can only be attained if the Kingdom's education system experiences a major revamp.</p><p>As part of the Vision 2030 goals, Saudi Arabia aims to create nearly 500,000 private sector jobs and to increase non-oil revenues to SAR530 billion by 2020. In doing so, the government wage bill share is expected to fall from 45 to 40%, or to SAR456 billion.</p><h4>EDUCATION, SKILLS HURDLES</h4><p>As of 2015, there were more than 500,000 teachers in Saudi Arabia, making the education sector the country's third-largest employer after the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior. There are 25 public and 27 private universities and some 30,000 schools across the country. The education sector's scope, however, belies its quality.</p><p>The system has long been flawed. Even Vision 2030's underwhelming education goals may be out of Saudi Arabia's league. The country's secondary schools have low academic standards and churn out under-achieving students, often to fill undemanding state positions. As a result, lucrative private companies—often in the energy industry—have turned to skilled overseas employees or foreign-educated locals.<br>While the government hopes to minimize the need for foreign workers to fill skilled positions, it will need to take substantial measures to effectively overhaul a severely lacking education system. For Vision 2030 to succeed, Saudi Arabia must capitalize on the knowledge, skills, and expertise of its younger adult population.<br>In 2015, the Ministry of Education announced that Saudi universities would accept 95% of high school graduates. A few years prior, the Kingdom had approved the goals of the Afaq project, a program that aims to improve the efficiency of the higher education system in the Kingdom by developing a 25-year strategic plan. The Afaq project suggested universities limit their enrollment to 55% from highs school and 15% from community colleges. The project also insisted that Saudi universities reduce their capacity by 40% while technical and vocational training programs increase their enrolment three-fold. The 95% enrolment rate is far higher than that of other countries, including the UK (57%), Japan (50%), Switzerland (38%), Germany (36%), and Turkey (30%), according to 2012 figures.</p><p>Saudi Arabian high school schools continue to study courses at universities that do not fulfill labor market needs. With too many students enrolled in universities, there will be even more students graduating without the marketable skills required to ultimately benefit Saudi Arabia's future. By limiting enrolment to universities, Saudi Arabia's education sector could instead focus on quality of the education offered and on the skills being provided to students.</p><h4>K-12 PRIORITY SHIFTS</h4><p>Part of this struggle originates as early as the K-12 level. Instead of students being introduced to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) during these years, they are versed according to the teachings of sharia law, with most weight placed on religion, culture, and history. For students to excel later in STEM subjects, they will need exposure to them at the K-12 level.</p><p>Realizing the importance of K-12 education, the Vision 2030 plan established the Irtiqaa program. The goal of Irtiqaa is to have 80% of parents engaged in school activities and the learning process of their children by 2020. The implications of this program could be significant, since it is usually families' housemaids who tend to children's care and interests during these years. Involving parents could shift familial dynamics and inspire more interest in children's education among parents.</p><h4>Education Reforms and Facilities</h4><p>As students reach higher education, the government is attempting to provide them with marketable skills that will benefit the local economy. Investing in vocational education has been the government's greatest weapon yet.</p><p>According to the US-Saudi Arabian Business Council, in 2015 Saudi Arabia spent USD3.28 billion (SAR12.3 billion) on opening three new universities and completing projects on several college campuses. An estimated USD640 million (SAR2.4 billion) was allocated to constructin</p><p>g new vocational and technical colleges as well as completing additions to existing projects.</p><p>Firms like the UBT Company, which focuses on investments, consultation, and operations for higher education, professional training, and knowledge transfer, fulfill the imperative for highly skilled professionals. UBT CEO Mohanad A. Dahlan told TBY, “Today the country needs to quickly and efficiently equip large numbers of young people to do specific jobs. Right now, vocational and training schools are seen as the most effective way to provide careers for the Saudi youth. That is why we are investing in vocational business and training and leveraging our existing resources in line with Vision 2030's goals and objectives. We have more than 85,000 teachers in the region qualified to receive teacher training and self-development; we aim to serve them."" <br>In 2005, King Abdullah created the King Abdullah Scholarship Program (KASP). The government-funded program sent students abroad to earn academic degrees and medical fellowships. In 2015, Saudi Arabia dedicated USD6 billion (SAR22.5 billion) to sponsor scholarship programs for 207,000 Saudi students studying abroad. But following oil revenue reductions, the program's funds have been cut and in 2016 only 2,000 students were awarded scholarships.</p><p>In 2009, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology was founded in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, where it provides research and graduate training programs in English. The university has the third-largest endowment of any university in the world after Harvard and Yale, respectively. It offers studies in biological and environmental sciences and engineering; computer, electrical, and mathematical sciences and engineering; and physical sciences and engineering.</p><p>For Saudi Arabia to improve its economy, it will have to adapt to global education and skill standards. In doing so, Saudi Arabia must grow local expertise and avoid over reliance on foreigners for jobs requiring skills and experience.</p><p>Saudi Arabia will also have to emphasize non-traditional fields of study in addition to STEM subjects, including humanities, political science degrees, and the arts in order to encourage the developmental needs of students.<br>The education infrastructure is in dire need of change in order to achieve the Kingdom's Vision 2030 goals, but it will take time and commitment to witness results. Improved education infrastructure can provide incentives for nationals, especially skilled ones, to remain in Saudi Arabia and build their home country. It remains to be seen how the government will step up to the challenge and effectively change course. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/6271ca7e-6d64-4953-a5cc-7912c873f070.jpg","","","","Vision 2030's success almost entirely hinges on the development of the education sector.

"2017-10-10T12:02:00.000Z","2017-10-10T12:02:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Changing Face of Saudi’s Health Sector","<p>Saudi's health industry is undergoing a huge restructuring as part of the Vision 2030 and National Transformation Program 2020. In health, more so than in most other industries, the opportunities for private investors will be as widespread as ever, ranging from general private healthcare facilities to medical insurance, increased use of technologies, training, and local manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Each of these services were previously managed and regulated by government bodies, most notably the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). Today, this is shifting rapidly toward the private sector and clear targets have been put in place. Namely, up until 2020, the government is working toward boosting private healthcare expenditure from the current 25 to 35% of total expenditure. This projection would imply an increase in private sector revenue from SAR3 billion (USD799 million) currently to SAR4 billion (USD1.1 billion).</p><p>Speaking exclusively to TBY, Deputy Minister of Health and Director of the ministry's Vision Realization Office Dr. Khalid Al Shaibani outlined the steps already taken by the government and the challenges that lay ahead: “One of the themes of our transformation is collaboration with the private sector. We have identified more than 40 [PPP] opportunities…we have already released two out of nine major initiatives that involve clinical services provision in the country under the MoH. Clearly, as a massive health structure, we need to pilot our plan before we truly scale up and implement our plan across the board.""</p><p>By “across the board,"" the Deputy Minister is referring to the over 365 hospitals and 2,500 primary care centers operated, and regulated, by the MoH. “That cannot be the case. We have plans in 2018 to separate this process so that the MoH will no longer provide care. The provision of care will be given to multiple corporates that will then compete with each other on the basis of quality of services and patient care, experience, and safety,"" he explains.</p><p>A key segment within healthcare that is expected to see widespread reform and increased private sector participation is pharmaceuticals. While there are over 200 drug producers and retailers registered with the MoH, the market remains largely dominated by European suppliers while local manufacturers hold a mere 20% market share. Yet, with the pharmaceutical sector expected to grow by 10% annually to reach USD13.6 billion by 2020, the opportunity for private investors has never been greater. As explained by Mohammed Saud Al Badr, the Managing Director of public-listed Saudi Chemical Company, which recently launched a drug manufacturing plant in Hail through its subsidiary AJA Pharma, the importance of producing medical supplies locally is not only an issue of national security, “but also a source of diversification for the economy."" Several other investors from across the industry interviewed by TBY, including Sidanah and Sudair Pharmaceuticals, likewise expressed their enthusiasm for the government's initiatives to empower local private sector manufacturers and indeed outlined their own plans to expand production capabilities in light of the NTP and Vision 2030 ambitions. such, the government has taken a backseat and is allowing the private sector to shape the future of healthcare. As detailed by the Deputy Minister, PPPs are expected to kickstart this process; it is a model the government has much experience with in sectors such as transport and energy, and it ensures the state's stake in a booming industry. In some segments, such as medical equipment or technology, joint ventures will be sought with international players due to their increased R&amp;D capabilities. In others, such as pharmaceuticals, loans and other financial incentives are being prepared to support local production.</p><p>Saudi's health sector is clearly in a transitional period towards a more privatized future. Nonetheless, all eyes remain on the government to ensure that this transition is smooth and beneficial for the state, investors, and citizens alike. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Vision 2030 calls for the privatization of a broad spectrum of sectors, but the health sector stands out for its scores of applicable subsectors, PPP opportunities, and pilot projects.","","HEALTHCARE","changing-face-of-saudis-health-sector","2851","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5583f87986b7b00e186be189","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, as the implemented policies revolve around providing easier, more affordable access to homes for citizens, and in particular the booming young population and first-time buyers, it is also one of the most important socioeconomic issues on the Kingdom's national agenda, making it a key component of the Vision 2030 reforms.</p><p>In fact, according to the Minister of Housing, Majed bin Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Hogail, strains on the local residential sector “take the lead“ in the “large synchronized government efforts toward trying to solve national challenges.“ This is because, despite widespread government efforts and growing private sector participation, the gap between supply and demand continues to widen exponentially.</p><p>A closer look at the demographics reveals why. As a nation with one of the youngest populations in the world, over half of Saudi's citizens are under the age of 25. However, there is a shortfall of 100,000-200,000 housing units delivered to the market each year. While currently 47% of Saudi's own their homes, it is clear that unless a concrete transformation plan is introduced—and successfully implemented—this figure will likely dwindle as the local population surges to 37 million by 2025.</p><p>In line with Vision 2030, the government's response has been broad-based and purposeful in tackling the supply deficit head on. And as with most other sector impacted by the Vision's reforms, the focus will be on privatization. Specifically, the ministry hopes that the PPP model will contribute over 1.5 million homes up until 2022, and has allocated over SAR200 billion (USD53 billion) in private-sector incentives to further stimulate developers, such as offering financial support for those using energy-efficient installations.<br>Another key policy is the revamping of the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF), which assists and subsidizes over 500,000 citizens looking to get their foot on the property ladder. According to the Minister, the REDF will also, “use its USD50 billion assets to invest back into the real estate development sector, which is a major cash injection into the supply side of the sector.“ Speaking on the REDF's new role, the fund's Director General, Ayham Al Yousef added, “By 2018, we will have moved away from being a lender utilizing huge resources to becoming a market maker, one that can support banks strategically or tactically, introduce products, pull out other products, and to be able to move the market strategically to the benefit of citizens, who are our beneficiaries.“</p><p>An increasingly popular means of accessing fresh financing for the housing sector has been through the issuance of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs. At the beginning of 2016, the Capital Market Authority approved the listing rules for REITs, paving the way for easier, direct access for smaller investors in Saudi's real estate.</p><p>Despite the obstacles that lay ahead, not least stubbornly low oil prices, which often have a tit-for-tat impact on construction, Saudi Arabia's leadership has shown it has the determination and mechanisms to solve one of the greatest challenges of its young and vibrant generation. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Increasing Housing Supply","solving-saudis-housing-quagmire","1347","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

	In April 2016, Saudi Arabia announced its Vision 2030, a comprehensive blueprint that aims to diversify the country's economy by shifting away from dependence on oil and strengthening other sectors. Shortly thereafter, in June 2016, the Kingdom approved the National Transformation Program 2020 (NTP) as the vessel through which the government would realize its Vision 2030 goals, with healthcare as a central focus.
</p><p>
	According to US-based consultancy Aon Hewitt's “2016 Global Medical Trend Rates"" report, Saudi Arabia's healthcare sector is set to witness incredible growth, at a rate of 12.3% until 2020, ultimately amounting to USD71.2 billion. Of the approximately 150 major healthcare infrastructure projects underway in the GCC until 2018, 87 of them are taking place in Saudi Arabia.
</p><p>
	Saudi Arabia accounts for some 47% of the GCC's USD42-billion worth of investments in healthcare infrastructure. The Ministry of Health plans to invest more than SAR23 billion on healthcare projects over the coming five years, during which time it hopes to encourage private investments. Vision 2030's main objective is to source such investments from private players, increasing private healthcare expenditure's share of total healthcare expenditure from the current 25 to 35% by 2020—SAR 3 billion to SAR 4 billion.
</p><h4>
	POPULATION GROWTH CHALLENGES SUPPLY
</h4><p>
	Rapid, continued growth of Saudi Arabia's population, coupled with a strong influx of expatriates, has placed increasing pressure on the country's healthcare sector. The Kingdom has the largest and fastest-growing population in the GCC with a 2.2% annual growth rate. Colliers estimated the 2016 population of Saudi Arabia to be 31.6 million, 22.8 million of which were nationals. By 2020, total population is expected to rise to 32.7 million and, by 2025, to 36.7 million, according to Colliers. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has the world's fifth-highest rate (33%) of obesity, high rates of type II diabetes, and high incidences of trauma and accidents.</p><p>
	The Ministry of Health owns 60% of all hospitals within the Kingdom, all of which offer free basic healthcare services to Saudi nationals. In 2012, Saudi Arabia covered some 66% of total healthcare spending. In 2013, the Kingdom spent approximately USD36 billion—4.8% of GDP—on healthcare, according to Deloitte. It allocated USD28.8 billion to health and social welfare in its 2014 budget, including the funding of 11 new hospitals, 11 medical centers, and two medical complexes. With this boost in investment, the Ministry of Health hopes to increase hospital capacity from 28,000 beds in 2014 to 68,000 beds by 2019.</p><p>
	However, the rise in population is encouraging the government to open the market to private institutions and insurers in order to fill the supply gap and improve medical facilities across the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia experiences shortages in doctors, nurses, and beds when compared to other developed countries—the Kingdom has the lowest number of beds, nurses, and doctors per person among all the other countries in the GCC. Increased privatization will stand in where state assistance cannot and improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>
	Dr. Khalid Bin Mohammed Al Shaibani, Deputy Minister for Planning and Health and Director Vision Realization Office of the MOH, told TBY, “The MOH today has a conflict of interest. It provides care through a network of more than 365 hospitals and 2,500 primary care centers, but is at the same time the governor and the regulator."" Al Shaibani emphasized the government's attempts to move toward the privatization of hospitals. “We have started what we call the “pathfinder"" engagement [….] we hope that by 2030, we will have corporatized and granted them autonomy. Doing so would reduce the level of decision making to as close to the patient as possible and allow hospitals to develop competitiveness.""</p><h4>LUCRATIVE INSURANCE MARKET </h4><p>
	The Kingdom's insurance sector is expected to grow by 17% per year over the next five years. Backed by the government's enforcement of existing regulations, health insurance dominated insurance growth—it accounted for some 52% of gross written premiums in 2014. From 2013 to 2014, gross written premiums grew 22%, from SAR12.9 billion to SAR15.7 billion, respectively. From the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2016, gross written premiums grew from SAR19 billion to SAR19.2 billion. In the first half of 2016, insurance density stood at SAR1,245, a 10.4% increase on the first half of 2015, when insurance density rested at SAR1,236.</p><p>
	By the end of the first half of 2016, Saudi Arabia's insurers hit a total profit of SAR820.4 million, a substantial rise from their consolidated profit of SAR262.7 million in the first half of 2015. Meanwhile, the return of equity in the first half of 2016 rose to 12.4%, from the 9% in the first half of 2015.</p><p>
	There are 35 licensed insurance companies in Saudi Arabia. Bupa, Tawuniya, Medgulf, and Malath dominate the insurance market, accounting for 22.3%, 20%, 11.1%, and 7.5% of the total health insurance market, respectively. From the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2016, Bupa's shares increased 140 basis points (bps) and Tawuniya's shares increased 262bps, while Medgulf's shares fell 291bps.<br>
	Health insurance is the leading segment, making up 51% of the total insurance market. It is followed by vehicle insurance (32%), general insurance (14%), and saving and protection (3%). Three health insurance companies control 83% of the market. Bupa and Tawuniya's health insurance market share increased 305 and 385bps, respectively, from the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2016.</p><p>
	These figures spell a lucrative market for health insurers. The most recent push in its growth is the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance's issuance of new regulations that require all private-sector employers to register their employees and their dependents under a single policy for mandatory health insurance.</p><h4>
	PHARMACEUTICALs</h4><p>
	According to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the National Transformation Program plans to spend more than SAR23 billion on new initiatives, including the localization of the pharmaceutical industry. The goal is to increase the percentage of local pharmaceutical manufacturing as part of the total market value from 20 to 40%.</p><p>
	Saudi Arabia has a 59.4% regional market share of the purchase of pharmaceutical products in the GCC region. The Kingdom spent USD8.46 billion in 2015 on pharmaceuticals, with a 10% annual growth rate. In 2015, per capita spending on pharmaceuticals stood at USD268 million and this figure is expected to increase to USD400 million by 2020. According to BMI Research, Saudi Arabia's pharmaceutical market is estimated to reach a value of SAR51.2 billion by 2020.</p><p>
	There are currently 27 pharmaceutical manufacturers operating in the Kingdom, but imported pharmaceutical products comprised 80% of the domestic market in 2014. The government hopes to reverse this trend.<br>
	So far, foreign companies have jumpstarted production of antibiotics, diabetic treatments, cardiovascular drugs, and anticoagulant facilities at the King Abdullah Economic Industrial Valley in Saudi Arabia. In April 2015, Saudi Pharmaceutical Industries subsidiary Dammam Pharma received a SAR54.1-million loan from the Saudi Industrial Development Fund to finance a part of its project to construct a pharmaceuticals plant in the eastern province of Dammam.<br>
</p><p>
	In 2015, AJA Pharmaceutical Industries, a subsidiary of Saudi Chemical Company, received a SAR157.5-million short-term loan agreement from the Gulf International Bank for partial financing of AJA Pharma's new 120,000sqm manufacturing facility in Hail Industrial City. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/42829e05-7abf-455c-963b-75f0959c4443.jpg","","","","Saudi Arabia's healthcare sector is heavily supported by the government but experiences shortages across the board.

It is estimated that Jamaica is blessed with over 9 billion tons of these rocks.<br>Predominantly used as a construction material and a road base, limestone can be utilized in a wide range of sectors.</p><p>Powdered limestone is used in the paper, paint, rubber, and plastics industries, but the high quality of Jamaican limestone also makes it suitable for the food, pharmaceutical, and metallurgical industries.</p><p>The largest deposit is located in the Cockpit Country protected area in Trelawny, but exploration efforts have revealed spots of high-grade limestone in four other parishes: St. Elizabeth, St. Mary, Portland, and Westmoreland.</p><p>Recent studies from the Mines and Geology Division of the Ministry of Transport and Mining confirmed the presence of approximately 2.5 billion tons in Sherwood Forest, Portland, and more than 6 billion tons in targeted areas in St. Elizabeth and Trelawny.</p><p>Limestone in Jamaica is usually extracted in open pits and in February 2016, 77 licensed limestone quarries had operations in Jamaica.</p><p>The main company in the sector is Lydford Mining, each year exporting 120,000 tons of high quality limestone including 100,000 tons of industrial-grade and 2,000 tons of ground material. According to the Planning Institute of Jamaica, production in 2016 totaled 2,748 kilotons, rising from 1,960 kilotons in 2015 thanks to higher local demand from the construction industry. Exports in 2016 totaled USD3.5 million a 7% increase from 2015.</p><p>Most of the exports are directed to Canada, the US, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and South America.<br>Despite the huge reserves of limestone and the large number of quarries operating in the island, a majority of the quarries operate under capacity, and the sector lacks financing. Production is able to meet local demand and then some, but less than 10% of extracted limestone is shipped abroad.</p><p>Jamaica is missing out on a huge opportunity given the lucrative market for limestone in the Americas. On top of the quality of its mineral deposits, Jamaica boasts competitive advantages given the fact that unlike most neighboring countries, limestone deposits are not located in residential areas and the country benefits from an existing pool of experienced mining workers.</p><p>In a presentation released on April 18, 2017, Minister of Transport and Mining Michael Henry reaffirmed that the government is committed to promoting limestone as a means to encourage “cross-sectorial integration and promote rapid economic development"". The Minister also announced that the Mines and Geology Division would continue to produce geology evaluation reports on the limestone deposits in the parishes of Trelawny and St Elizabeth during the year.

"2017-10-10T07:35:00.000Z","2017-10-10T07:35:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Budget Airlines Take to the Skies","<p>Saudi Arabia's prime low-cost carrier, Flynas, stunned the industry on January 16, 2017 by confirming its purchase of 80 new aircraft from European manufacturer Airbus. In a deal worth USD8.6 billion, the airline placed an order for 60 new A320neos, and upgraded its existing order of a further 20 A320 narrow body jets to the new model.</p><p>The deal, which in LCC terms is only rivaled by FlyDubai's USD11.4 billion purchase of 111 Boeing aircraft back in 2013, will likely prove a game-changer for the Saudi carrier as it looks to expand its existing fleet of 29 leased A320s. In fact, once delivery commences, scheduled throughout an eight-year period starting 2018, Flynas will boast one of the largest budget airline fleets in the Middle East.</p><p>Speaking to TBY days before the deal was made official, the airline's CEO, Paul Byrne hinted, “We are close to the end of the process with Airbus to buy a total of 100 aircraft. This is split between 60 aircraft coming in over the next 10 years and options for the other 40 aircraft."" And while Byrne insists, “Flynas still sees itself as a regional airline,"" the breakthrough deal will certainly allow it to spread its wings to an ever-growing list of fresh destinations in and around the Middle East.</p><p>Yet it is within its own primary market, Saudi Arabia, which accounts for 70% of the airline's traffic, that Flynas is bracing itself for stiffer-than-ever competition. In 2016 the Kingdom's aviation sector encountered its most dynamic year in recent history, as a number of low-cost carriers look to disrupt existing market forces.<br>Namely, Dammam-based SaudiGulf Airlines was granted a license for domestic flights in June 2016, shortly followed by Nesma Airlines, which though Saudi-owned, is headquartered in Cairo. In addition, the local industry is bracing for another newcomer to enter the market, with the news that national carrier Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia)—the Middle East's second biggest—would launch its own LCC. By 3Q2017 the newly formed Flyadeal is expected to hit the skies, with a fleet target of 50 aircraft by 2020.</p><p>Byrne points to the fall in oil prices as the key factor for this surge. “Typically with a drop in oil prices, planes that were sitting idle are more viable, and, as a result, we have been inundated with competition.""<br>Yet to truly understand the boom in Saudi's aviation sector, one ought to analyze the vast reforms introduced by the government, principally through Vision 2030. Amongst its key initiatives lies the aim to drastically boost its Hajj and Umrah industry by increasing the number of visitors from 8 million in 2016 to 20 million by 2020 and 30 million pilgrims by 2030.</p><p>As pointed out by the Mayor of Mecca, Osama Al-Bar, in an interview with The Business Year, “With the completion of the new King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, with an annual capacity of 34 million travelers, bringing visitors here should be much easier.

"2017-10-10T07:23:00.000Z","2017-10-10T07:23:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Cleared for Takeoff","<p>Saudi Arabia's journey to greater economic diversity has already begun. While some sectors have yet to be touched, others have already seen significant restructuring or policy changes. The aviation sector's momentum has been growing tremendously recently, largely due to a new venture aimed at bringing in greater private sector involvement. Not only is the aviation sector one of the first to begin a transformation, but the early and seemingly countless successes of the government's endeavor thus far reveal the magnitude of success the vision is poised to be.</p><h4>AIRPORTS</h4><p>The country's officials had been discussing the privatization of the state's flag carrier, Saudia Airlines, for nearly 15 years. For much of that time, the process moved very slowly, until finally, in 2012, Saudi Catering was privatized and listed on the stock exchange, followed by Saudi Ground Services in 2015, which then went public.</p><p>It is not just former Saudia arms that are now flourishing. When TBY sat down with Adel Abdulmajeed Abuljadayel, the Chairman of Adel Abuljadayel Flight Catering, he described the company's interesting history—not long after opening as the first airline catering business in the country, Saudia monopolized the industry. However, Abuljadayel, after spotting gaps in the market, came back and eventually broke the monopoly, winning a tender against Saudia with Flynas. Now, the catering company is shooting even higher. “We are planning to hold an IPO in around 2020 because that is in line with the government's Vision 2030, to have 30-40% public ownership. This will create greater transparency and impose clear management procedures and standards for companies,"" the chairman said. “Now is the best time for listing and going to the market. This is the only way to continue in the Saudi market and grow, otherwise we will be keeping ourselves limited to a restricted market share.""</p><p>On a much grander scale, the government has commenced plans to privatize at least 11 of the country's airports by 2020. The first facility to be corporatized in this endeavor is King Khaled International Airport's Terminal 5, located in Riyadh. In one of the first deals of its kind, the Dublin Airport Authority will run the airport as a concession for five years, when the rest of the airport is poised to be privatized as well.</p><p>This was quickly followed by other major boosts to the country's privatization program. On June 8, 2017 the government signed a score of contracts corporatizing airports throughout the country. Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport will be operated by Singapore's Changi Airports International for 20 years; the new Taif International Airport, set to be completed by 2020, is to be developed and then operated by a consortium consisting of the local Asyad Holding, Munich Airport, and Consolidated Contractors Co; and another consortium, consisting of Turkish TAV Airports Holding and Saudi's Al Rajhi Holding Group, will operate three airports: Hail International Airport, Prince Naif Bin Abdul Aziz Airport in Qassim, and Prince Abdul Mohsen Bin Abdul Aziz Airport close to Yanbu. While the deal in Jeddah is strictly for the operation and maintenance of the facility, the airports in Taif, Hail, Qassim, and Yanbu are based on the build, operate, transfer (BOT) model.</p><h4>AIRLINES</h4><p>While certain arms of Saudia Airlines have been spun off and privatized, the airline still remains under the ownership of the government. Its days as a monopoly, however, are certainly no more. The General Authority for Civil Aviation has recently granted several operation licenses for airlines in the Gulf, both full service and low cost, setting the stage for a fierce competition for passengers.</p><p>In 2016, the country's aviation sector encountered its most dynamic year in recent history, as a number of low-cost carriers sought to disrupt existing market forces. Namely, Dammam-based SaudiGulf Airlines was granted a license for domestic flights in June 2016, shortly followed by Nesma Airlines, which though Saudi-owned, is headquartered in Cairo. In addition, the local industry is embracing for another newcomer to enter the market, with the news that national carrier Saudia—the Middle East's second biggest—would launch its own LCC. The newly formed Flyadeal is expected to hit the skies by 3Q2017, with a fleet target of 50 aircraft by 2020. <br>Saudi Arabia's prime low-cost carrier, Flynas, stunned the industry on January 16, 2017 by confirming its purchase of 80 new aircraft from European manufacturer Airbus in a deal worth USD8.6 billion. The purchase, rivaled only by FlyDubai's USD11.4 billion purchase of 111 Boeing aircraft in 2013, will likely prove a game-changer for the Saudi carrier as it looks to expand its existing fleet of 29 leased A320s, eventually making it one of the largest budget airline fleets in the Middle East. The airline has already played an integral role in transforming air travel in the country by going beyond Saudi's three major cities and introducing fresh routes to smaller towns such as Abha, Bisha, and Tobuk,<br>The boom in Saudi's aviation sector has everything to do with the vast reforms introduced by the government, principally through Vision 2030. Amongst its key initiatives lies the aim to drastically boost its Hajj and Umrah industry by increasing the number of visitors from 8 million in 2016 to 20 million by 2020 and 30 million pilgrims by 2030. As the Mayor of Mecca, Osama Al-Bar, pointed out in an exclusive interview with The Business Year, “With the completion of the new King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, with an annual capacity of 34 million travelers, bringing visitors here should be much easier. There are more airlines coming, and visa issuance has recently been eased for visitors, businessmen, and tourists, especially from Islamic countries.""</p><h4>AEROSPACE</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's vision for a more diversified economy does not end at just privatization; the government wants as much as possible to be made or utilized in the country. For aviation, this means developing and cultivating a powerful domestic aerospace industry. The country has long been at work to make itself self sufficient for aircraft maintenance. While this effort has taken much time to move forward, the industry is now taking off at a faster and faster speed.</p><p>TBY recently discussed the changing industry with Ahmed Jazzar, the Vice President of Boeing International and the president of Boeing Saudi Arabia, which has a long history in the country. While Jazzar and his colleges welcomed the announcement of Vision 2030, the company made little changes to its strategy. “Over the years, Boeing has led the development of the aerospace industry in the country. Looking at the industry as it stands today, the major companies were created by Boeing,"" Jazzar stated. “All along, Boeing had the strategy of being local in Saudi Arabia. We are part of this fabric; it is a market that benefits the company, and we always think of it as a partnership, so we do not shy away from investment in the country.""</p><p>Building infrastructure for the country's formidable defense industry also relies on the success of the aerospace industry. The vision seeks to localize defense spending by 50%. Building a sustainable aerospace industry will require businesses in the area to obtain something currently in short supply in the country: skilled local labor. To satisfy the government requirement of increasing Saudization levels, industries are becoming closer to universities and are building training facilities of their own.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, the president and CEO of Al Salam Aerospace Industries, Yahya H. Al Ghoraibi, spoke of the importance of working with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to secure and build know-how in the country. The country's goal of localizing defense spending is entirely possible, according to Ghoraibi, as the country already has all the resources it needs. “We have the raw materials and national companies that can process the raw materials and produce, for example, aluminum, and machine shops that can manufacture parts as well as companies that can manufacture and assemble high-tech components and equipment,"" he said. “So all the components for local manufacturing are available and the individual companies are all working with each other to bring local defense manufacturing to reality."" </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/22ee810b-518e-46b6-8049-bcbfac79e0ef.jpg","","","","While recent reforms such as Vision 2030 seek to invigorate every sector of the economy, the aviation sector is likely to see the largest and most successful transformation.","","","cleared-for-takeoff","1816","552ef2b0361618126878404e","59dc87c386b7b026b89b1391","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Arabian Peninsula is dominated by shrubland and an expanse of sand and sky so devoid of anything the local name for it translates to “the Empty Quarter,"" but today the country is home to 30 million residents and some of the world's most impressive buildings. When you consider the determination needed for this to happen, it is little surprise that the Saudi construction industry is characterized by a vision without peer in the Middle East. Megaprojects like the Abraj Al Bait, the Al Faisaliyah Center, and the Bruj Rafal are markers of the Kingdom's drive to turn its oil wealth into cultural and economic monuments and the role construction plays in developing a society. The fall in oil prices has led to decreased growth in recent years, but the government's commitment to the industry has never been in doubt, and recent reforms have participants optimistic about the long-term health of the sector.</p><h4>2016 PERFORMANCE</h4><p>Like the rest of the oil-exporting GCC states, the drop in oil prices over the past year hit Saudi Arabia hard in 2016. The world's largest oil exporter collected SAR329 billion (USD87.7 billion) from crude oil sales revenues in 2016, down from USD285 billion in 2014 and USD157 billion in 2015. As the petroleum sector accounts for over 90% of budget revenues and over half of all GDP, the ripple effects of this fall were unsurprisingly throughout the sector. Saudi Arabia posted GDP growth of just 3.48% in 2015 and 1% in 2016. In the midst of all this, the real estate and construction sectors saw uneven results. The real estate sector saw softer demand due to decreases in consumer and purchasing power, though well-established corporate and retail centers in Riyadh and Jeddah served as stabilizing forces. Construction, on the other hand, was more directly impacted by the drop in government spending and contracting. Research firm BMI estimated that the construction sector contracted by 1.9% in 1Q2016 and 3.1% in 2Q2016 en route to an overall 62% drop in contract rewards. </p><h4>REAL ESTATE</h4><p>The Saudi real estate market is concentrated in Riyadh and Jeddah, the two largest cities in the country and the home of the majority of all commercial and economic activity. 2016 saw residential rents fall slightly in both cities (4% Riyadh and 1% in Jeddah), with prices remaining high in part due to a lack of new construction. Increasing the supply of housing in the country is a priority for the Saudi government, which is concerned about a lack of affordable homes. With Riyadh expected to add over half a million residents by 2020, increasing the housing stock is a pressing issue needed to secure human capital and contribute to the long-term growth of Saudi Arabia. With this in mind, 2016 saw the launch of a few programs designed at adding to the housing supply and creating a more stable housing infrastructure. In early 2016, the Saudi government debuted the National Transformation Program, a roadmap for meeting the goals of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030. One of the goals of the program is to raise the size and economic importance of the real estate sector; the plan calls for the sector's share of GDP to go from its current 5 to 10% by 2020, and for the percentage of housing units given to subsidy-eligible citizens to rise from 10% to 50%. The emphasis on affordable growth bodes well for both future prices.</p><p>The Saudi government is also in the midst of implementing a new “white land"" tax (WLT) to spur the development of underutilized plots of urban lands. The new policy calls for the owners of undeveloped urban land marked for residential or commercial use to pay a 2.5% tax on the value of the land each year, hopefully making it more expensive for landowners to sit on property and thus boosting the available stock of housing in the country. The tax is designed to target large-scale developers, as it only applies to plots larger than 10,000sqm. The WLT was only implemented in mid-2016, so its effects have not been fully seen, but government and industry leaders anticipate it achieving its primary effects. Changes are also underway at the Ministry of Housing, which is undergoing its own set of reforms to strengthen the financial and structural underpinnings of the sector to increase public investment in the sector and ensure more long-lasting success. Majed bin Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Hogail, head of the Ministry, told TBY that the scale of the current transformation is “unprecedented"" but necessary for a strong Saudi future. “Today, the Ministry has transformed itself into an enabler and catalyst of housing,""Al-Hogail told TBY. “Previously, the private sector shied away from operating in the middle and lower class housing market… The Ministry today perseveres in working alongside the private sector in order to facilitate a business friendly environment and create investment opportunities in order to shift gears in the sector. The new strategic direction will inevitably result in higher supply of better quality housing at more affordable rates.""</p><h4>RETAIL &amp; OFFICE</h4><p>In the retail sectors, rents fell slightly in the face of lower consumer spending, but the imminent arrival of some new developments has been delayed as developers wait out the current economic slowdown. Jeddah saw retail rents fall 3% YoY and Riyadh 2%, but the Kingdom's position as a centerpiece of the global luxury shopping sector means that the sector still expects strong performance in 2017 and the near future. Areas for future growth can be split into two categories: in the luxury sector, the arrival of delayed megaprojects projects like the USD1.6 billion, 250,000sqm Al Diriyah Festival City Mall will solidify Riyadh's position as a luxury hub, and developers see untapped potential in the lower- and middle-income markets. Similarly to housing, the continued growth of the Saudi population will likely create new opportunities in the mid-range sectors. In the office market, rents remained stable, rising by 1% in Riyadh and falling by 1% in Jeddah, according to JLL research. The impact of the fall in oil prices could be seen in the vacancy rate, which rose to 13% in Riyadh and remained stable at 6% in Riyadh. 2017 is expected to bring more of the same, with corporate downsizing resulting in continued decreases in prices and increases in the vacancy rate. The lack of major new developments to market will is expected to keep vacancies lower, however, and should help prevent any dramatic fall in rents.</p><h4>CONSTRUCTION</h4><p>The lack of new projects has its silver linings for the real estate sector, but it speaks to the difficulties the Saudi construction sector is facing. The government has traditionally been responsible for over two-thirds of all construction activity, meaning that the industry was directly impacted the fall in revenues  and corresponding tightening of the government budget. The fall in revenue led to a spate of late payments, with French credit insurer Coface reporting that payments in the construction sector were delayed by an average of 123 days. The government began a repayment system that disbursed SAD140 billion in delayed payments in the final two months of the year, but the uncertainty still took its toll. The UAE overtook Saudi Arabia as the largest construction market in the region, and some of the country's largest contractors were forced to cut staff in the face of decreased activity. The Council of Economic and Development Affairs announced in late 2016 the cancellation of USD226.7 billion in projects; while none of the core Vision 2030 growth projects were cancelled, the decrease was another hit to a sector that could hardly afford it.</p><p>Yet despite these issues, there are a number of reasons for optimism in 2017 and beyond. The downturn has removed some superflous firms from the market, giving those that remain a better chance at success. Government spending is likely to increase throughout the year, leading to better performance in the second half of the year. The aforementioned white land tax and Vision 2030 housing developments should provide a stable new source of contracting work over the next decade, and there are a number of major projects underway that should provide an additional boost. More importantly, the current downturn has made the government realize that some structural changes are needed to stabilize the industry. Increased partnerships with the private sector to strengthen the non-government share of industry is a priority moving forward, and steps are already being taken to increase the interchanges between the two. Hassan Al Qahtani, CEO of Technical Development Company, believes that this change in strategy is key to the recovery and continued development of the construction sector. “The government reorganized its vision with a new philosophy,"" Al Qahtani told TBY. “Now, the private sector is also involved."" This collaboration has taken the form of PPPs and passing some contracts onto private developers, and continued progress in this regard bodes well for the sector.</p><h4>INFRASTRUCTURE</h4><p>Infrastructure is one of the current focuses of Saudi Arabia's development program, with massive transport projects planned in Mecca, Jeddah, and Riyadh. Aside from providing the sector with much-needed economic activity, the projects are key to increasing efficiency and transport options for a population that expected to add 15 million people in the next decade. The Mecca Metro project is an illustrative example of the future of the Saudi construction model and new collaborations between the government and the private sector. At USD16.5 billion, the Mecca Metro plan calls for 182km of track and 88 stations to be built over six years, but financing issues led to delays in 2016. In early 2017, the Saudi government announced that a PPP would be used to fund the project, with a tender to be awarded later in the year. The size of the project, will give the sector a boost and help return construction spending to pre-oil price decrease levels, but more promising is the use of PPPs to move construction forward even in the face of decreased public sector spending. “We need to double what the government spent [on infrastructure] over the last 30 years,"" Qahtani told TBY. “The government started doing joint projects with the private sector, and this has helped us."" </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/3a69dddc-7edf-4640-878d-a3bcd98c924a.jpg","","","","The construction sector was hit hard by the fall in oil revenues in 2016, but the Saudi government's long-term development plans and newfound emphasis on PPPs bode well for the future of the sector.","","","something-out-of-nothing","1755","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Roadmarch is the final day of festivities of the Carnival season</em></p><p>Jamaica is one of the most iconic island destinations and enjoys a significant competitive advantage in tourism. Blessed with strong environmental, human and cultural assets, the Jamaican tourism industry probably contributes as much to the Jamaican brand as it benefits from it. According to the Planning Institute of Jamaica, total visitors in 2016 increased by 3.9% to 3,827,240 persons, the majority of which (64.4%) are stopovers from the US. The main destinations include the internationally renowned Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, and Negril.</p><p>The tourism industry is one the main drivers of Jamaica's economy, contributing approximately USD2 billion and employing 94,850 people, or 8.1% of the employed labor force, in 2016.</p><p>From September 24-26, 2017, the Jamaica Product Exchange (JAPEX), a forum showcasing Jamaica's tourist offerings, was the occasion for Prime Minister Andrew Holness to inaugurate three new hotels: the Jewel Grande Montego Bay Resort and Spa, Breathless Montego Bay Resort and Spa, and Zoetry Montego Bay for a total investment of USD150 million. Amendments made to the Hotel Incentives Act in 2015 have since facilitated tourism-related investments, granting tax breaks to hoteliers for refurbishing on top of income tax and import duty relief.</p><p> However, hotels in Jamaica are mainly all-inclusive resorts, and although many actors of the sector are trying to improve their local print, there is a still a lack of linkage between them and the local economy. What is more, according to information presented at JAPEX 2017 from Edmund Barlett, Minister of Tourism, Jamaica is “among the destinations of the world that has the highest leakage of US dollars from tourism expenditure.""</p><p>In 2013, a council chaired by renowned hotelier Adam Stewart of Sandals Resort was established to provide general guidance regarding tourism linkage initiatives. Five areas of focus were identified: gastronomy, health and wellness, sports and entertainment, shopping, and knowledge.</p><p>Culinary tourism is very promising. According to a 2012 United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) report, 88.2% of tourists “consider that gastronomy is a strategic element defining the brand and image of their destination."" The Jamaica Tourism board created a “Jamaica House"" during the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio De Janeiro. The hospitality hub welcomed fans, athletes, international media, and 180 travel agents with a taste of the Jamaican cuisine and culture.</p><p>Another interesting example of investment mixing transport, gastronomy, and tourism is the expansion of the Appleton Rum Tour. The tour is scheduled to reopen in November 2017 as the Appleton Estate Rum Experience (AERE) and includes the renovation of the property and the surrounding landscape, a retail store and a gourmet restaurant preparing local cuisine. The government is also working on reopening the train line from Montego Bay to Appleton as a mean to make transportation easier and enhance the experience. The investment plans to grow the number of visitors from 50,000 to approximately 200,000 annually. The Appleton Estate Rum Experience will be part of a Gastronomy Network, created by the Ministry of Tourism to map the best food available on the island and promote the island's culinary offerings.</p><p>Still, a study commissioned by the Tourism Linkage Network highlighted that before visiting the island, only one out of three visitors considered Jamaica as a food destination. Another issue related to the disconnect of tourism with other sectors is the lacking incentive for hotels to source their food locally.

"2017-10-04T13:36:00.000Z","2017-10-04T13:36:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Make It Do What It Do","<p><strong></strong>The Riyadh Metro project is the largest single infrastructure project being built anywhere in the world today in terms of cost and mileage. Since initiation in 2014, construction of the project has come aboveground, literally and figuratively. In late 2016, most of the tunneling was completed, and today the aboveground sections, flyovers, stations, and ground-level tracks are being completed at a rapid rate.</p><p>During the tunneling process, construction caused traffic delays in an already congested city, and grumbles were forthcoming. Today, the mood has shifted. Massive cranes lay concrete sections on elevated tracks that run for kilometers over the city. Modern stations are taking shape. It is apparent from a short drive across Riyadh that the city is on the brink of an unprecedented transformation.</p><p>With almost 6 million people, Riyadh contains nearly the population of the entire country of Oman, or about twice the city of Dubai. There are nearly no public transportation options, and the city has an area nearly the size of the state of Delaware in the US. This makes for crippling traffic and transit time when travelling, for example, from the north, where King Khalid International Airport is located, to the south, where the Diplomatic Quarter can be found.</p><p>What is interesting today about the Riyadh Metro project is how it fits into the Kingdom's larger ambitions. Officials are pushing through reforms under the banner of Vision 2030 with a vigor rarely seen in years where Brent crude prices were higher. Each segment of the vision seems to have been carefully planned to tie in with others, and the metro has clear benefits to the Kingdom's largest metropolis.</p><p>The vision wants Saudis to be more connected to their government and to have more options for what to do with their time. The Metro offers to bring together parts of Saudi society in a way that other infrastructure simply cannot. It will link all parts of the city and deliver access to entertainment venues, government offices, malls, and workspaces, bringing people together in public spaces. In Riyadh, these forces are certain to indelibly change the cultural makeup and ambiance of the city.</p><p>The metro, however, also does not stand alone. It will be complemented by a citywide bus system, said to be optimized with app-based mobile technology that minimizes waiting time. When combined with an already extensive adaptation of ride-hailing services like Uber and Careem, which have both seen substantial investments by PIF, the same wealth fund that is bankrolling the metro, Riyadh has found itself to be significantly more connected.</p><p>There are questions of whether Saudis, used to riding in their cars, will even take the metro. However, at least half of the Kingdom's population is under 25, and the expense of cars is a burden for many.<br>There is also more at stake than mere convenience. For example, the King Abdullah Financial District, a multi-billion dollar megaproject consisting of 59 towers that is nearly finished but has no significant tenants, will have its own dedicated metro station. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia's social contract is a carefully balanced affair. Fuel prices are expected to rise each year, and will be followed by a VAT tax as well as even higher utility prices. Efficient and affordable public transportation will ease the burden on consumers in Saudi Arabia's largest population center and will make the reforms that Saudi Arabia must undertake in the coming years easier to swallow. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Riyadh Metro","make-it-do-what-it-do","1518","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405b","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2017, IT and telecoms spending is expected to reach USD7.4 billion and USD34.1 billion, respectively. As of mid-2106, 21 million people, or 65% of the country, used the internet, with 3 million of them fixed broadband subscribers. However, mobile penetration rates suggest that most Saudi Arabians access the internet via smartphone devices, as subscriber numbers stood at 48 million people in late 2016. Prepaid subscriptions constitute the majority of mobile use at 82%.</p><p>At the same time, 3.5 million people were subscribed to fixed-line telephone services. According to local press, the telecoms market was set to generate revenues of USD19 billion by the start of 2017.<br>The Kingdom's ambitious economic reform plan includes targets that are bound to stimulate investment in telecoms and IT, such as the aim of doubling the contribution of IT and telecoms to 2.3% of non-oil GDP by 2020.</p><p>To make that happen, the government has continued spending heavily on the sector. In 2015, the government invested nearly USD14 billion in IT, more than any other country in the GCC. In a move to centralize expenditures on an array of service systems, the government has teamed up with local ICT solutions-provider Jawraa, a company that announced its intentions to build a fully localized data cloud over the coming years. This initiative, among a variety of other localized digital transformation objectives, will feed into the government's strategy for creating 500,000 new jobs, many of which are expected to be technology based. In tandem, international tech firms are entering the Saudi marketplace at a rapid pace, activity that is certain to drive job creation, increase competition, and raise the quality of services and products.</p><p>The Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) is the regulator of the sector, an entity tasked with providing advanced telecoms services at affordable prices, promoting and encouraging fair competition, ensuring effective and interference-free usage of frequencies, developing telecoms technology that keeps pace with the Kingdom's growth, maintaining transparency, enforcing the principles of equality and non-discrimination, and safeguarding both public interest and the interests of users and investors. </p><h4>MOBILE GIANTS</h4><p>The largest and most valuable telecoms brand in the country is Saudi Telecom Company (STC). In 2017, the company moved up to 252nd place in Brand Finance's “most valuable brand“ rankings. The company also held on to its ranking as the number-one brand in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the company's brand value rose 11% in 2016 to reach USD6.2 billion. Local sources attribute the increase in value to STC's fresh marketing campaigns, which engage stakeholders and customers in a more personable and human way.<br>However, STC is also taking concrete steps to expand and improve its operations in Saudi Arabia. In May 2017, STC signed an agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia to provide high-speed, fiber-optic broadband services throughout the Kingdom. The project is expected to cost around USD2 billion and will connect 1.3 million housing units to the grid.</p><p>The firm has also announced plans to set up a USD500 million venture capital fund in 2017, with the aim of supporting and investing in startups around the Kingdom. The fund will be a key contributor to Saudi Arabia's promotion of SMEs, as well as promote an increase in digital infrastructure and the expansion of the country's technology industry base. “The fund will invest globally in promising technologies and digital sectors, especially in areas where the company can tap into its assets and infrastructure and help it enable its investments to grow,"" Khaled al-Biyari, CEO of STC, told local press. This international move comes after STC's purchase of a further 25% of Kuwaiti telecoms provider, Viva, giving the Saudi Arabian company a majority stake of 51.8%. As well, STC formed a managed services partnership with Cisco to upgrade and improve its network. The agreement is expected to continue through 2020.</p><p>Although holding over a 50% market share, STC faces several growing competitors in the telecoms sector. Zain Saudi Arabia and Mobily, two other large ICT providers, are estimated to hold just under 25% of the market each. In late 2016, the Saudi Arabian government planned to award unified licenses to Zain Saudi Arabia, Mobily, and GO Telecom, which would allow the smaller operators to offer fixed-line telephone services for the first time, whereas previously only STC had been permitted to offer such services. Following STC's lead, Zain Saudi Arabia also started an agreement with an international ICT company in 2017, choosing Ericsson for a five-year deal to upgrade its equipment and service standards.</p><h4>DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION</h4><p>IT companies in Saudi Arabia wear many hats, not least of which is acting as consultants and catalysts for the overarching digital transformation that is well underway. To make the transformation complete, as well as reach both the 2020 and 2030 national goals, local and global IT players are focused on job creation, educational program development, advanced technology implementation, and the establishment of sophisticated infrastructure.</p><p>Cisco Saudi Arabia is leading the charge by working closely with the government. “The consultative role we have in our partnership with the Saudi government is based on our longstanding collaboration with Saudi businesses and public sector entities, organizations, and stakeholders,“ Haytham A. AlOhali, General Manager of the company, told TBY. Since its arrival in the country, Cisco Saudi Arabia has created a network academy program that has educated up to 82,000 students at 90 institutions around the Kingdom. “There are also other efforts that we are working on in partnership with the government around incubators and accelerators, to help develop the startup and entrepreneurial ecosystem in Saudi Arabia,“ AlOhali added. By demonstrating a commitment to the advancement of the country in parallel with the growth of its operations, Cisco Saudi Arabia has come to be recognized as a responsible and sustainable force in the local IT sector. Its activities precipitate relationships and partnerships between governments and enterprises, and with a little over 20 years of history in the region, Cisco considers itself “part of the fabric of community and of the technology industry.“ Recently, the government commissioned the company to digitize 10 segments of local development, including healthcare, smart cities, education, energy, and cyber security. “There are several other domains that we are exploring, and which we are working on demonstrating the value that digitization would bring to them,“ AlOhali concluded.</p><p>Following a similar model, Siemens operates guided by its motto, “What is important to Saudi Arabia, matters to Siemens.“ The company, which first arrived in the Kingdom nine decades ago, employs over 2,000 people in Saudi Arabia and prides itself on the capabilities of its largely localized workforce. In order to build up human capital in the country, Siemens has introduced its own unique curriculum to the education sector, offering a program in mechatronics. “This internationally accredited program is rooted in the German dual-education system. The curriculum applies a 'systems approach' toward managing the electrical, mechanical, and IT aspects of increasingly connected energy, transport, and manufacturing infrastructure,“ Arja Talakar, CEO of Siemens in Saudi Arabia, explained to TBY. By remaining deeply engaged with its local partners, the company is producing leaders and vocational managers, many of whom go on to work at Siemens sites around the world.<br></p><p>In 2017, General Electric signed MoUs for the sale of USD7 billion of GE technology to Saudi Arabia, as well as for the training of Saudi Arabian citizens in cloud-based data skills and expertise. The agreement is also expected to impove efficiency in manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas. The nation's hydrocarbons giant, Saudi Aramco, told local media that it expected GE to create 250 more high-tech jobs, specifically for Saudi Arabians.</p><p>SAP has shifted its focus in Saudi Arabia from educating the market on the importance of technology toward promoting technology acquisition and adaptation according to specific business needs. “There is a clear connection now between technology transformation and economic diversification; the digital economy is in a mature stage in Saudi Arabia,“ Ahmed Al Faifi, Managing Director of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Yemen for SAP, told TBY. To support this new era for technology in the Kingdom, SAP has created a platform that provides solutions with a localization team that adheres to regulations, erasing the need for the authorities to supervise activity. “We created a co-innovation center to allow a space for companies to build solutions together along with SAP; and we have opened the platform for the rest of the IT community so that they can give their ideas and help us,“ Al Faifi emphasized.</p><p>Local operator Jawraa has also searched for opportunities to support the government in its technological agenda. To complement the Ministry of Education's plan to provide tablets to every child in Saudi Arabia—roughly 6 million tablets—Jawraa CEO Yasser Al Obaidan saw a vision to manufacture the tablets locally. “The plan called for contracting the tablets through a foreign manufacturer, but we believe that the best thing to do in this case was to develop a domestic manufacturing capacity so that value could remain in the country,“ Alobaidan told TBY. “This would have myriad positive impacts on the Saudi economy while creating an infrastructure that could continue to pay dividends into the future.“ The company estimates that by establishing a local tech manufacturing industry, GDP could increase by up to 1%.</p><p>The digital transformation comes into play in the finance sector as well. Biometric verification and iris-scanning technology are two new methods available for Saudi Arabian banks to enhance the security of their operations and ease of use for their customer base. In addition, part of the 2030 vision is to completely move to an electronic payment system that would limit the need for circulated cash. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/d990e4a3-ac0c-4feb-85ee-b41e68013831.jpg","","","","","","","technically-speaking-saudi-arabia-2017","1530","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405a","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It represented the largest single investment ever made in a private company, at a time when the start-up was testing its ability to enter eastern emerging markets. By November of 2016, PIF's investment strategy was firmly focused on extending its technological arm to another sector at the crossroad of unprecedented transformation: retail.

Specifically, each of its suppliers will have to undertake an IKTVA test that will assess the value of locally sourced goods and services used, salaries paid to Saudi citizens, training and development efforts for Saudis, and supplier development spending, and divide this figure by the company's revenue received from Saudi Aramco. This figure will then be multiplied by 100, and if the company's IKTVA score is over 70, they will be approved.</p><p>Speaking exclusively to TBY, Abdulaziz AbdulKarim, Saudi Aramco's Vice President for Procurement and Supply Chain Management—essentially the department responsible for IKTVA's launch and implementation—explained: “The program was designed to positively change the way Saudi Aramco engages with its suppliers when procuring goods and services, targeting primary goals that will enable a sustainable economy, supply chain, and energy sector.“</p><p>The target of reforming Aramco's entire supply chain by 2021 is ambitious to say the least. Currently a 30% IKTVA score for any given company is considered strong, and Aramco's own local procurement figures linger around that figure at present. However, whether these targets are realized within four years or not, the ambition alone creates “enormous potential…for local spending to trickle down to a variety of industries and services,“ argues Dr Abdulrahman Al Zamil, Chairman of Zamil Group and one of the loudest proponents of the IKTVA program. </p><p>The USD23 billion spent on oilfield services and equipment (OFSE) annually in the Kingdom suggests that if the 70% target is achieved, up to USD17 billion will be pumped back into the local economy.</p><p>Naturally, a possible drawback to the program is that, for now, local procurement could potentially compromise quality and lead to worse prices when compared with services provided by internationally renowned brands. In addition, such structure could prove off-putting for any potential partners aiming to work with Aramco on an ad-hoc basis. The company's vice president countered these concerns by stressing: “We want an increased presence in Saudi Arabia not only to finalize assembly operations, but also to establish and develop their manufacturing supplier base and regionalize research and development (R&amp;D) alongside their operations in the Kingdom… We are committed to those companies through our long-term agreements.“</p><p>However, IKTVA's biggest test will be its legacy. That is, the ability of such a formula to surpass the boundaries of a single company (albeit one of the biggest in the world), and to extend its reach to the wider economy. <br>Saudi firms in the industrial and oil and gas sectors have been broadly positive about the concept and feasibility of IKTVA, and many have suggested that the program ought to be used as a model for other local powerhouses, including SABIC, Ma'aden, and the government itself. AbdulKarim confirmed that “such discussion and collaboration is ongoing to ultimately adopt a localization program where we think that IKTVA can be the base of the national localization initiative.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Strict requirements for oil services in Saudi","formula-1","1585","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784059","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-10-04T09:01:00.000Z","2017-10-04T09:01:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Hejaz Unhindered","<p>Well into the late 19th century, it is thought that some 20% of hajis were still perishing from the punishing conditions of the 40-day schlep from Damascus across the Arabian Desert and Hejaz mountains to visit Mecca. And though necessity may be the mother of all invention, war is often the midwife: given the Ottoman Empire's preoccupations with British expansion in the Gulf and Horn of Africa, it made perfect sense to build a railway from Damascus to Mecca—not only to facilitate travel to the world's most important place of pilgrimage, but also to connect Constantinople with Ottoman military garrisons in the southernmost stretches of the empire. The Hejaz Railway was thus launched in 1908.</p><p>Cut short by the outbreak of World War I, the famed railway never got further than Medina, some 400km short of its target. But thanks to a hugely ambitious scheme now being undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the 19th century dream of connecting Medina with Mecca is now on the verge of being realized. Slated to open in part by December 2017 and in full by March 2018, the Haramain High-Speed Rail project, alternately known as the “Western Railway"" or the “Mecca-Medina railway,"" will cover a total distance of 450km and connect Mecca at the southern end with Jeddah, King Abdullah Economic City, Rabigh, and Medina to the north, including a 3.75-km extension to the King Abdulaziz International Airport.</p><p>Under construction since March 2009, the country's first-ever high-speed railway network is designed to travel at 320km/hour. In March 2017, it was reported that some 430km had already been completed by the Spanish-led Al-Shouna consortium of two Saudi firms and 12 Spanish ones that won the EUR6.74 billion (USD7.7 billion) contract in 2011 to build the railway. The three leading firms in the consortium, the Spanish national rail company Renfe, train-maker Talgo, and Spanish state track operator Adif, will provide service and maintenance for 35 trains to operate the line for a period of 12 years. Though Haramain is far and away the consortium's single-largest foreign project to date, Spain does boast the second-largest high-speed railway network in the world after China, with some 3,100km of rail already laid and another 1,800km of track under construction.<br>A pretigious project for the Kingdom, it is imperative that it is completed on time by early 2018, not only to prevent any further prodigalities—having already gone USD160 million over budget and missed its original December 2016 opening—but, more importantly, to ease the overwhelming traffic of pilgrims to Mecca and Medina each year. With an estimated 1.5 million people expected to arrive in the holy city this year for the five-day Hajj, the Haramain will take extensive pressure off the nation's overworked road network, ferrying up to 500,000 pilgrims by rail to the Kingdom's two holiest sites.</p><p>When completed, the railway will also be an engineering feat of staggering proportions, not just a social and religious one. Given the violent winds of the Arabian Desert, which can cause huge sand dunes to form overnight, many of the stretches en route to Medina from Jeddah will be acutely vulnerable to such formations. Though the consortium has already begun building up to five-meter walls along much of the railway's trajectory, the builders—who have overcome similar if not quite as acute topographical challenges in Spain's harsher climates—will still face a daunting learning curve in keeping sand off the tracks. It is thought by several experts that maintenance teams will have to sweep sand from the tracks every night. All the same, the speed with which things are progressing and the vehemence with which the Saudi transport minister Sulaiman Al-Hamdan is overseeing the project's completion suggest the consortium will have no choice but rise to the challenge.</p><p>Elsewhere in the country, railway expansion continues afoot. In February the Saudi Railway Co. (SAR) opened the first phase of a new 1,250-km railway that will eventually link Riyadh to the land port of Al-Haditha on the Jordanian border. Putting the Saudi rail network within 163km of the Jordanian capital, Amman, and a mere 235km from Jerusalem, the line has already opened three stations that extend from Riyadh as far as Qassim, a region several hundred kilometers northwest of the Saudi capital. When completed, the Riyadh-Al-Haditha line will be connected to the Riyadh-Dammam line, built in 1951 and terminating at Saudi's largest port on the Arabian Gulf, Dammam. Eventually to consist of six cars, at this initial stage the Riyadh-Al-Haditha line will have two cars with a total capacity of 444 passengers.</p><h4>Cities of Salt no longer asunder </h4><p>With Riyadh's population expected to grow from 6 million today to 8.5 million in the coming decade, the challenge to accommodate this explosive growth and reduce an overreliance upon automobiles with cutting-edge public transportation is already underway. Destined to open in 2019 to the tune of USD22.5 billion, the Riyadh Metro will have six lines, 85 stations, and run a total length of 176km. Responsible for the first two lines is the BACS consortium of Bechtel, the largest construction and civil engineering company in the US, Almabani (SA), Consolidated Contractors Company, headquartered in Athens and the largest construction firm in the Middle East, and Siemens, based in Munich and the largest manufacturing and electronics firm in Europe. Line 1 will run through the center of Riyadh from north to south and cover 38km, much of which will be underground. It will have 22 stations, four of which will have transfers. Line 2 will run east to west over some 25km and have 13 stations, three of which will have transfers. </p><p>Meanwhile in the heart of the city, developer Saudi Oger, Saudi's largest construction firm, is fast at work building the new King Abdullah Financial District. To service this “eco-friendly, car-free oasis,"" as it is calling it, the Canadian aerospace and transportation firm Bombardier won a USD241 million contract in 2010 to build its signature Innovia Monorail 300, already in place in São Paolo, Las Vegas, and Disney World, to service the pedestrian district. The 3.6-km monorail will consist of six two-car driverless Monorail 300 trains and have six stations.</p><p>Above ground, the city recently awarded Turkish construction conglomerate Yüksel a USD508 million contract to build the city's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. To include 34 stations, 1,353 bus stops, and six pedestrian bridges, this last phase of the project will “complete"" the city's transport infrastructure plan, in the words of Yüksel chairman and CEO Emin Sazak. Financed by the Ar-Riyadh Development Authority (ADA), the BRT will “provide metro-quality service at a fraction of the cost,"" and greatly increase public transportation ridership in the Kingdom's capital, Yüksel said. Slated to be finished in 2017, the BRT will consist of three lines spanning 85km and add to the Riyadh bus network's total 22 lines traversing more than 1,200km and 6,765 bus stops. <br>Further west along the Red Sea, similarly ambitious plans are underfoot to build a world-class underground transportation network in Jeddah. Launched in 2015 with an estimated total cost of USD12 billion, the Jeddah Metro's four lines are slated to open by 2022 and expected to transport 30% of all the city's commuters by 2040. London-based Foster + Partners won the contract to develop the project's architectural vision, which will include the design of all 46 stations and the trains that will service them.</p><p>A large aspect of the project will be the creation of new underground and shaded public amenities located at various stations throughout the system. Their inspiration for these is the ancient quarter of Al Balad and its dense, tree-lined shaded urban core, which allows for bustling commercial and cultural interactions. Those “transport nodes"" will each form the nucleus of new pedestrian-centered urban neighborhoods. As things currently stand, only 12% of Jeddah's residents live within a 10-minute walk of the city's current transportation nodes; the aim of the new Jeddah Metro is to increase this to over 50%—and with it enhance the vibrancy and diversity of the Kingdom's most dynamic city. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/822b76b5-41c0-488c-bf66-94cea2fa5ed5.jpg","","","","An ambitious series of road and rail projects from the Jordanian border down to the Indian Ocean are slated to open in part before the end of 2017.

"2017-10-03T11:30:00.000Z","2017-10-03T11:30:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Stay Covered","<p>After five years of double-digit growth managed under the careful regulation of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the Saudi insurance sector decelerated for the first time in 2006, as gross written premiums (GWP) posted a 0.5% annual growth and reached SAR35.8 billion (USD9.5 billion), after the 19.7% growth posted the previous year.</p><p>According to data disclosed by SAMA, health and motor insurance, which are mostly compulsory insurance lines, have been the main drivers of the sector, contributing in 2016 to a combined 84% of the total market GWP. Health insurance was the biggest insurance line, accounting for 51% of the sector's total GWP with SAR18.6 billion (USD5 billion) in underwritten premiums, while motor insurance GWP amounted to SAR12.2 billion (3.3 billion), contributing to 33% of the total market GWP. The sector's stagnation can be explained by a decline in the health insurance GWP by almost 2% to SAR18.6 billion (USD5 billion) in 2016, whereas in 2015 it had increased by 20.3% to SAR19 billion (USD5.1 billion). Meanwhile, motor insurance grew by 13% on the back of higher prices thanks to actuarial pricing. Protection and savings insurance accounted for 3% of total GWP and remained the smallest category in the sector.</p><p>Overall, the total number of insurance policies in the sector decreased to 7.3 million in 2016, down from 8.1 million in 2015. As the Saudi economy was hit by the collapse in oil prices, a resulting growth in budget deficit and cuts in public spending have reduced levels of employment, which in turn have reflected in the fall in insurance policies in the sector. However, the Kingdom's insurance sector was only indirectly and slightly affected by the volatility in oil prices, and it is expected to recover thanks to SAMA's decisive actions to expand the scope of compulsory insurance.</p><p>Although over the last five years insurance penetration has increased at a CAGR of 19%, it was still only 1.5% in 2016, a rate that is significantly below global average of 6%, and still below GCC levels of around 2.5%, suggesting a significant growth potential. To tackle this potential, the regulator is implementing recently approved policies that will gradually enforce the uptake of compulsory coverage for millions of uninsured employees and motor vehicles.</p><p>In April 2017, the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance (CCHI) announced the start of the fourth phase of implementation of the unified health insurance, which was approved by Cabinet decision in April 2016 and started in July 2016. This final phase is targeting Saudi or non-Saudi employees of companies with 25 or less employees and their dependents. Such companies will be required to join larger firms in providing health insurance for their staff. The first stage included companies with more than 100 employees, the second stage companies with between 50 and 99 employees, and the third stage, which started in January 2017 reached out to companies with 25-49 employees. This finalstage brings all companies in the economy under the scope of the unified health insurance system.</p><p>According to local news reports, only 45% of vehicles in the country are insured, the remaining 55% being illegally out in the traffic. Moreover, S&amp;P Global refers to official estimates of about 2.5 million Saudi nationals working in the private sector without being covered by their employers, as well as some 870,000 foreign workers and their families, specifying that this figure excludes the 1.9 million foreign domestic staff employed by Saudi families who are not yet required to have medical insurance. These numbers indicate an important potential for market growth that will be triggered if the government is able to identify and bring in the outliers.<br>However the most striking result of the year 2016 was that, despite a 0.5% growth in business volume in the industry, net profit surged by 160%, with consolidated net result reaching a total of SAR2.1 billion (USD560 million) in 2016, up from SAR810 million (USD216 million) in 2015. This growth in profit rates can be attributed to the results of actuarial pricing introduced by the regulator in 2013, a measure which needed to be taken after a period of intense price competition that had eroded the profitability of the industry. Since then, tariffs of compulsory lines have to be approved by an independent actuary according to statistical expectations of loss and profit. With a regulation issued in January 2016, the regulator described the procedures for appointing an actuary and his or her roles and responsibilities. Accordingly, SAMA requires insurance and reinsurance companies to apply the regulation latest by January 2017. As companies' bottom lines have finally started to reflect this new policy, smaller companies will from now on be unable to acquire market share through aggressive price cuts and may lose their customer base if they are not capable of offering high-quality services and a range of insurance products.</p><p>In 2016, eight of the 34 insurance companies active in the industry generated 72% of the sector's total GWP, while the remaining 26 companies contributed to the remaining 28% of the market premiums. The two biggest companies contributed have a combined market share of 43.4%.</p><p>The Kingdom's long-term vision to diversify the economy away from a 90% dependence on oil export revenues will reflect on insurance activities growing beyond compulsory lines, as Ehab Yousef Linjawi, CEO of Gulf General Cooperative Insurance Company, told TBY, “The name of the game here is to move the awareness of people from 'I purchase insurance because it is compulsory' to 'I purchase insurance because I need it and I believe in it.' Then we can move the third party into a comprehensive service.“ He also emphasized the role of insurance companies in shaping the demand in the market, adding, “We can move there by providing services and gaining knowledge of new technologies. This is in line with what the insurance regulator would like insurance companies to do. They do not want to have to enforce; they want the public to realize there is a benefit behind insurance. In the public's mind, it is a way of not taking out money. We believe that whatever happens in any mature market will happen in growing markets. That is the story of banking and credit cards. When credit cards were introduced in Saudi Arabia, they were only for the educated, businessmen, and the elite. The rest of the people were using cash, but now everyone is doing it electronically. The banking companies did that, not the regulator.“</p><p>An important segment for the Saudi insurance industry is Islamic insurance, or takaful, where Saudi Arabia is the global leader with a gross written contribution (GWC) of USD9.7 billion. Media sources refer to the latest data disclosed by the Global Takaful Report, according to which global takaful GWC is estimated to have reached USD14.9 billion as of the end of 2015. In the GCC region, the takaful industry has grown by CAGR of 18% between 2012 and 2015. In 2015, the GCC had an overall market share of 88% of the general takaful market, where Saudi Arabia and the UAE reported the strongest growth with 20 and 19%, respectively.<br>In the long term, the Kingdom's Vision 2030 plan will stimulate growth in sectors such as healthcare, tourism, and real estate development. These sectors will in turn create a demand for other types of insurance beyond the compulsory lines. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Insurance","stay-covered","1326","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-10-03T10:59:00.000Z","2017-10-03T10:59:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Supply Curve","<p>Saudi Arabia's variety of export-oriented industries—including oil and gas, metals and mining, logistics, agrochemicals, and FMCGs—makes it the largest industrial producer in the Middle East. Though historically dominated by hydrocarbons output, such as oil production and petrochemicals, the sector is seeing dramatic diversification under the guidance of the National Transformation Plan (NTP) 2020. One of the key goals of the NTP is to boost production at Saudi Arabia's industrial cities from 252 million tons to 309 million tons annually.</p><p>While the NTP is a short-term target, Vision 2030 is carrying the country toward a wider plan of economic diversification, job creation, and localization in sectors other than oil and gas. “This is a huge push toward new, non-oil related local industries as well as exporting. It is not just about local content for projects; it is about creating opportunities here,"" Aiman Al-Masri, CEO of MESC Group, told TBY. “The aim of the 2030 Vision is to have high levels of industry, but also to have local suppliers for these industries.""<br>The plan to create opportunities for local manufacturers also has the trickle-down effect of reducing the cost of raw materials. With more supplies being sourced locally, industrial companies in Saudi Arabia are expected to see increased profit margins. Mohammed Marwan Ourfali, General Manager of Balkis, explained in an interview with TBY that, “By collaborating with other companies and filling large volume orders, firms can bring down costs and stimulate the domestic market. We need to develop a long-term vision in the local market, because this can stimulate growth for many years to come.""</p><h4>MAJOR PLAYERS</h4><p>Official Saudi Arabian oil company Saudi Aramco is the force behind a forward-thinking added-value campaign to boost local suppliers in the market. With a forecast to spend SAR1.4 trillion (USD373 billion) over the next 10 years, the company will ultimately play a key in the success of the NTP 2020. “Our partnership with [suppliers] will create the economic and industrial building blocks for the Saudi energy sector,"" Abdulaziz AbdulKarim, VP PSCM of Saudi Aramco, told TBY. “It will also create hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs for talented young Saudi men and women over the long term."" To meet the demand for skilled manpower, Saudi Aramco is establishing training centers and programs in collaboration with related government entities. By 2030, the company will be operating approximately 28 training centers and 360,000 graduates. During 2016, the company spent over SAR10 billion (USD2.66 billion) on locally manufactured materials, representing 43% of overall expenditures, the highest percentage ever in its history. Over the medium term, the company is determined to double the share of its spending on locally manufactured materials and services to reach 70% by 2021.</p><p>In light of plans to diversify away from oil and gas dependency, Saudi Aramco has launched an innovative program that will be mutually beneficial for both public and private industrial players. The In-Kingdom Total Value Add (IKTVA) program is Saudi Aramco's platform for taking action to drive additional domestic value that will “support the rapidly changing economic environment and foster future prosperity."" Saudi Aramco has set its sights on producing long-term, tangible benefits, prioritizing consistency and transparency for the more than 1,000 industry suppliers across the company's local and international network. “IKTVA has been embedded in approximately SAR60 billion (USD16 billion) worth of contracts,"" AbdulKarim explained.<br>Another pillar of the industry sector is the Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), a Tadawul-listed, 70% government-owned manufacturing company established to convert oil byproducts into value-added chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers. As the world's fourth-largest chemical producer, SABIC specializes in ethylene glycol, polyethylene, polyolefin, polypropylene, granular urea, polycarbonate, polyphenylene, and polyether imide. The conglomerate currently has a number of potential projects in the feasibility study stage, including petrochemicals projects in the US and China. In early 2017, SABIC was set to start a feasibility study in agreement with Saudi Aramco as part of an MoU for the development of an oil-to-chemicals project in Yanbu. With the eventual aim of processing crude oil into chemicals without any intermediary steps, the cost of the project is estimated at USD30 billion.</p><h4>INDUSTRIAL CITIES</h4><p>Jubail, Yanbu, Ras Al-Khair, and Jazan are the major industrial cities that also serve as logistics and manufacturing hubs in the country. However, the government is also working on the construction of production centers for manufacturing and light industries in Raas Abu-Gamis, Bani-Tamim, and Debaa, areas that stand to benefit from the abundance of local natural resources that are available. In tandem, a program for localization and the development of new infrastructure is underway at Yanbu industrial city, where renewable energy, rubber, spare parts, and industrial gases form the major segments of the zone's output. Meanwhile at Jubail industrial city, Ras Al-Khair, and Jazan, the government is focused on the development of industrial clusters that can feed into the expansion of the Saudi Aramco refinery in Yanbu. The authorities have also pledged to develop value-added basic and transformational industries in Jubail and Ras Al-Khair, as well as establish housing in all four industrial cities, launch a minerals port in Yanbu, and enhance Jubail by building up multi-modal logistics channels. </p><p>Yanbu is currently the third-largest global refining hub in the world and the largest oil shipping port on the Red Sea. Experts suggest that Yanbu could overtake the top two refining hubs to become number one within the coming decade. “The Royal Commission's long-term vision for economic development and diversification moves Yanbu industrial city beyond exporting basic chemicals and intermediates and to producing more value-added downstream petrochemical derivatives and converted finished goods,"" Alaa Nassif, CEO of the Royal Commission at Yanbu, told TBY. According to the Royal Commission, megaprojects of over SAR10 billion are already in the pipeline for Yanbu's development. </p><p>Meanwhile, downstream investments at Jubail in 2017 will reach a total of SAR12 billion, a figure that reflects a series of new projects launched by the Kingdom in 4Q2016. In total, there are 242 new industrial projects planned for Saudi Arabia's industrial cities, a sector-wide investment plan that is expected to require over SAR215 billion (USD57.3 billion) to complete.</p><h4>RAW MATERIALS<br></h4><p>The Kingdom's plethora of natural resources continues to create significant opportunities for the industry sector, with strong demand for metals and metal-based products burgeoning locally and abroad. Construction materials such as cement are also showing promise in 2017.</p><p>According to the government, priority developments within the minerals and metals processing segment include a flat-rolled aluminum mill to produce automotive, construction, and other sheet panels; a multi-purpose aluminum rolling mill for products such as wire, rod, foil, and packaging; an aluminum foundry to produce power train, wheel, and other castings; a steel foundry to produce pumps, valves, and other castings; copper processing facilities to produce copper and alloy rod, cable, tubing, plate, pipe, and sheet; metal processing facilities for forging, machining, stamping, heat treating, and plating; brass alloy production; and magnesium and zinc powder production.</p><p>Following the lifting of a cement export ban that lasted from 2013 to 2016, cement producers are eager to rejuvenate expansion plans. There are currently 17 cement-producing companies in Saudi Arabia, with an estimated 25 million tons of oversupply.</p><h4>MAKE IT POSSIBLE</h4><p>Rich in oil and gas resources, Saudi Arabia's plastics and packaging sector has immense potential for further growth and development in terms of production volumes, product types, technological sophistication, and market expansion. According to recent reports, the petrochemicals segment contributes approximately 33% to industrial GDP and constitutes the majority of all non-oil exports.</p><p>NATPET operates a polypropylene plant in Yanbu with a production capacity of up to 400,000 metric tons per year on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. In an interview with TBY, Jamal Malaikah, President and CEO of NATPET, said “We chose this particular polymer product because there is high demand for it around the world—close to 62 million tons per year. Additionally, annual growth in demand is around 4%, or an additional 2.5 million tons per annum."" Polypropylene is used in industries such as automotive manufacturing, construction, packaging, healthcare, and home appliances.</p><h4>SPARE PARTS</h4><p>Heavily dependent on metals such as steel and aluminum, high-grade plastics, glass, and land area needed to build integrated manufacturing facilities, the automotive industry is starting to pick up speed in Saudi Arabia. Local manufacturers are also increasingly able to capitalize on competitively priced utilities, oil and lubricants, and raw materials. The country has long been one of the largest car markets in the Middle East, benefitting from direct shipping routes to the mass automotive markets of Asia and the subcontinent, including prime connections by air.</p><p>Currently, there are at least 350,000 new drivers entering the Saudi Arabian market every year, primarily due to the young median age of the population. “There are at least 350,000 new drivers entering the market every year. Demand is rapidly growing; hence, we will look more into used cars and help extend the life of cars. More drivers mean people will start to target the affordable segment, and smaller cars will be the next automotive trend,"" Majid Owaid Al Otaaibi, CEO of Takwa Group, told TBY. By Al Otaaibi's estimates, the passenger car market will reach 15 million within 10 years.</p><p>The Kingdom has a variety of development programs underway to enhance the automotive sector, including a vehicle assembly project, with the aim of producing 600,000 vehicles a year by 2025. Also in the pipeline are tire factories, designed for both local and export markets and targeting production capacity of 8-10 million tires per annum. The government has also expressed interest in improving the quality of its output through R&amp;D training. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/fc0f847f-f9fe-46b7-a466-8be18f2f33f9.jpg","","","","Industrial manufacturers look ahead toward localization, a move that is expected to reduce the cost of raw materials and attract more international companies to participate in the sector.","","","supply-curve","1829","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784059","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-10-03T10:58:00.000Z","2017-10-03T10:58:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Much to Note","<p>In April 2016, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman disclosed the Saudi Vision 2030 plan, a road map that lays down the strategies for a historic transformation of the Kingdom's economy to reduce its dependency on oil exports and modernize its capital markets by opening it up to international investors. Over the last four years, Saudi Arabia's capital markets have been marked by turbulence. A period of high investor confidence gave rise to several IPOs between 2013 and 2015, but this was followed by a period of depressed markets impacted by the fall in crude oil prices in 2016. Market turnover reached SAR20 billion (USD5.3 billion) a day and then dipped to under SAR2 billion (USD533 million) within just a couple of years, during which period the price of a barrel reached USD100 and then fell below USD30.</p><p>With the objective of increasing FDI to 5.7% of GDP by 2030 from the current level of 3.8%, the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) was first opened to foreign investors in 2015, with a set of regulations that defined a Qualified International Investor (QFI). The criteria were later eased to be effective as of the second half of 2017. Accordingly, a foreign institution will be able to register as a QFI if it manages global assets of a value of at least USD1 billion, down from USD5 billion under the previous regime. QFIs will be able to own up to 10% in a single stock (up from 5%), if allowed by the listing rules, and up to 49% of the capital of a listed asset will be open to foreign investors (up from 20%). Moreover, as the Tadawul is currently expanding the scope and variety of its traded instruments, QFIs are thus able to invest in not just shares but also exchange traded funds (ETF), bonds and mutual funds, and real estate investment trusts (REIT).</p><h4>Introducing small caps into the market </h4><p>Recognizing that SMEs are the most important agents of growth, the Kingdom's Vision 2030 sets the target of SMEs' contribution to the GDP to 35%, up from 20%. As a result of this strategy, in February 2017, Tadawul launched a parallel market called Nomu, announced as an alternative trading platform with a lighter set of rules for smaller companies, many of which are Saudi family businesses. For companies to list on Nomu, they are required to have a market value of at least SAR10 million (10 times smaller than what is required in the main market), a minimum of 35-50 shareholders, and at least 20% of shares publicly owned. Nomu will also open to QFIs. Al Hassan Goussous, CEO of Albilad Capital, told TBY in an interview that the number of listed companies is expected to explode: “It will happen because the second market will encourage these investors. First, for family businesses to give up 30% of their company is quite significant. The second market says 20% is enough; it does not want to deal with thousands of shareholders. For the second market, the minimum number of shareholders required is 50, so it will get them used to being listed. Do not forget that the government actually wants to do this. There are going to be quite a few government entities that will list—they are ready to list and they will list. That is part of the reason I say Vision 2030 is a gift to investment bankers.“<br>Alistithmar Capital CEO Hesham Hussain Abou Jamee explained to TBY that although the opening of Tadawul to QFIs was expected to boost liquidity, reduce volatility, and improve corporate governance practices in the corporate sector, the unfavorable economic and geopolitical scenario has not allowed the translation of these prospects into reality. However, he firmly believes that sooner or later we will witness the positive impact when QFIs start entering the market in visible numbers. He added that, “An increase in liquidity and reduced volatility will also encourage small and mid-cap companies and family business houses to expand their capital base and business by listing on the exchange. In fact, as the Tadawul will list these small and mid-cap companies in the alternative market, it will eventually prepare them to migrate to the main market.“</p><h4>Privatization as an essential  Vision 2030 program</h4><p>One of the main programs announced in the Vision 2030 plan is the “Privatization Program.“ HSBC has predicted that Saudi Arabia's privatizations will likely result in about 100 new IPOs in various sectors, including mining, healthcare, and retail. But what the investment banking world has been waiting for is the privatization of Saudi Aramco through the floating of up to 5% of shares in what is expected to be the world's largest IPO, in late 2018. It is estimated that the operation will raise USD100 billion, although the valuation of the company will need to be established once engineering studies reveal oil reserves and the cost structure of the oil giant. Nevertheless, the privatization is expected to create the necessary resources that will be used to diversify the economy through the Public Investment Fund (PIF), a move that will help achieve the 2030 target of non-oil government revenues to rise from SAR163 billion (USD43.4 billion) to SAR1 trillion (USD267 billion).</p><h4>REITs</h4><p>REITs are among the new financial instruments introduced into the Saudi capital markets as a means to diversify the economy and support liquidity and depth in the equity market. Saudi Arabia introduced its first REIT laws in October 2016, indicating a minimum trust size of SAR100 million, with at least 75% of the assets invested within the Kingdom. Three REITs have already been listed on the stock exchange: the Riyadh REIT, Al Jazira Mawten REIT, and more recently the Jadwa REIT Alharamain Fund.</p><p>CEO Abou Jamee of Alisthitmar Capital told TBY about the potential that REITs represent for the sector: “Our funds are among the top-three performers of the last two years, strengthened by the fact that we launched two equity and two real estate funds last year. We have launched a new fund of about USD133 million for a 40-floor luxury, high-end building with sky-villas, penthouses, and apartments in Al-Khobar. It will be first-of-its-kind project in the Kingdom, right on the Arabian Gulf's shoreline.“</p><p>REITs are thus a powerful tool for the development of the real estate sector by opening it up to small investors, thus contributing to the Kingdom's target of boosting the non-oil sector while addressing the current housing shortage in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Debt Markets</h4><p>In October 2016, Saudi Arabia's sovereign debt issuance reached USD17.5 billion, with the biggest emerging market bond issue to date. The bond issue was oversubscribed as demand reached USD67 billion, suggesting the potential of both the sovereign and corporate bond market for the region. The phenomenal demand reflected the global appetite built up in a world of negative bond yields. The Kingdom was thus able to address a budget deficit that reached 16% of GDP in 2016 resulting from the collapse of oil prices. The success of the operation suggests that the region will be able to attract more debt capital in the future, both sovereign as well as corporate.</p><h4>Reaching out to global markets</h4><p>For Goussous, this is just the beginning of a diversification trend of financing tools for private companies as more and more companies will look into capital markets for financing needs, and not only because of low oil prices: “This is a natural progression for any economy, as we are moving from an emerging market to a semi-developed and developed market. Many companies were dependent for their financing on just traditional banking facilities and that cannot sustain any growing economy. Large and small companies need to move away from just banks, so they will need to go through the various financing sources. They are either going to need to become a public company so they can add capital and invest, or they will probably need to go with their sukuk.“<br>As the Kingdom implements necessary regulatory reforms to bring the market up to international standards of governance and transparency, such as the proposal of a new Bankrupcy Law that will support the Vision 2030, the possible inclusion of the Tadawul in the MSCI Energing Markets Index in 2018 will trigger the awaited inflow of international funds. </p><p>Although the impact of these reforms will only be felt in the medium term, the leadership behind the new strategic direction has been well perceived by investors, as testified by Alistithmar Capital's Abou Jamee: “It is also evident for the last several months that the capital markets seem to be finally disassociating from the volatility in oil prices. This to me is very positive. The Saudi leadership is committed to reducing the dependence of the economy on oil; the Saudi Vision 2030 clearly lays the path for the vision. The market, in my opinion, has also recognized this change.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Capital Markets","much-to-note","1352","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This value rests primarily on the company's crude oil production of 10.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equal to the entire amount produced in the US per day. It also includes production of 1.5 million bpd of natural gas liquids and more than 10 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.<br>Moreover, the giant has rights to the largest recoverable oil reserves in the world at 267 billion barrels. These reserves are also easier and cheaper to extract than in any country, given Aramco's long-term investment in technologies and energy infrastructure. In addition to these rights, the company's assets also include a number of leading refineries and joint ventures with the biggest names in global energy, such as Saudi Aramco Mobile Refinery Company (SAMREF), Saudi Aramco Shell Refining Company (SASREF), and Yanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company (YASREF).</p><p>According to the Vision 2030 blueprint, a stake of just 5% will be made public. Nonetheless, this will still generate around USD100 billion—far exceeding Alibaba's USD25 billion listing on the NYSE, the biggest IPO to date.</p><p>In February 2017, global-powerhouses Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and HSBC were named as the underwriters for the offering. Yet, it was Moelis &amp; Company, a boutique investment firm from New York, which stole the headlines for landing its biggest advisory mandate yet for the IPO. The advisors are now in the process of restructuring Aramco internally to make it more attractive, efficient, and transparent for investors.<br>In terms of timing, the IPO was scheduled to take place in early 2018. Although, as TBY has heard in interviews with key players in the Kingdom's finance and energy sectors, this is likely to be pushed to late 2018, if not early 2019. Saudi's Tadawul will be the natural home of the listing, while it has also been made clear that there will be multiple listings, with New York, London, and Hong Kong each eyeing their place in the history books.<br>Yet, it is back in the Kingdom where the historical significance of Aramco's offering will be felt most. As outlined by Vision 2030, the ownership of Saudi Aramco will be transferred to the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's main investment arm. Already valued at over USD100 billion with key domestic assets through stakes in SABIC and National Commercial Bank, PIF is on course to become the world's biggest fund once Aramco's partial sale materializes.</p><p>As an indication of how the USD100 billion proceeds will be channeled, PIF has attracted global attention over the past 12 months through its strategic investments in innovation and advanced technologies. In particular, in May 2017 the fund confirmed its USD45 billion commitment to Softbank's Vision Fund, headed by Japanese tech-visionary Masayoshi Son. The initiative has raised a massive USD93 billion, making it the biggest private equity fund in the world. PIF has likewise pledged multi-billion investments into car-hire firm Uber as well as a joint venture with Dubai's Mohammed Alabbar to create the Middle East's future e-commerce giant, Noon, signaling the Kingdom's long-term, technology-driven objectives.</p><p>Perhaps the true benefits of Saudi Aramco's historic offering are best summed up the Crown Prince himself: “IPOing Aramco and transferring its shares to PIF will technically make investments the source of Saudi government revenue, not oil."" </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Global markets are eagerly anticipating the biggest IPO in history as the government gets set to put a portion of Saudi Aramco to market.","","Saudi Aramco IPO","worlds-biggest-worlds-greatest","1576","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784058","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-10-03T09:45:00.000Z","2017-10-03T09:45:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Nomu Room for You","<p>Saudi Arabia's capital markets witnessed a historic boost on February 26, 2017 as the long-anticipated alternative market, the “Nomu-Parallel Market,"" officially launched. In an official launch event attended by a number of representatives from the government and the local stock exchange Tadawul, Saudi's bourse—the largest in the Middle East—opened the doors to its smaller, yet ever-dynamic, alternative listing platform.</p><p>According to the government's broad-based Vision 2030, the country is on course to becoming a “market maker in selected sectors, as well as a leader in competitively managing assets, funding, and investment. All of this will require the formation of an advanced financial and capital market open to the world, allowing greater funding opportunities and stimulating economic growth."" </p><p>For most observers, the highlight of the reforms in the capital markets relates to the opening of the USD420 billion Tadawul to qualified foreign investors, or the much-anticipated listing of the world's biggest energy company, Saudi Aramco, projected to be the biggest IPO in history. Yet, in order for the markets to really stimulate widespread growth, the on-going reforms must go deeper into the business landscape and help strengthen the backbone of any economy—its small and medium enterprises.</p><p>Ranging from food distribution firms to industrial trading groups, with authorised capital varying from SAR11 million (USD2.9 million) to as much as SAR225 million (USD60 million), SMEs secured regulatory approval from the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) to list their shares on the opening day of Nomu-Parallel Market's landmark launch. </p><p>Officially, the main objective of the alternative market is, first, to secure additional sources of funding for issuers to access capital, and, second, to increase diversification and deepen the capital market. The mechanism for achieving this will include offering lighter restrictions to issuers, restrict trading to qualified investors, and give companies the opportunity to eventually list on Tadawul's main market, providing they file a new request with the CMA.</p><p>Speaking exclusively to TBY, Tadawul's CEO, Khalid Al Hussain, explained: “The main benefit of developing a parallel equity market that caters toward small- and medium-sized enterprises is that it provides an alternative platform for companies to access funding. This in turn allows companies to successfully expand their operations (organically or inorganically) and increases the creation of job opportunities with the ultimate goal of achieving sustainable growth.""</p><p>Specifically, the key differences between the main market and Nomu are that the latter requires a market cap of SAR10 million (USD2.6 million), compared to Tadawul's SAR100 million (USD26.7 million) cap. In addition, the main market requires issuers to offer at least 30% of total shares, while Nomu permits a minimum 20%, presumably to encourage family groups who are reluctant to part with large proportions of their stakes. On the issue of public shareholders, Tadawul-listed firms require at least 200, while the parallel market stipulates that, if the aggregate listed value exceed SAR40 million (USD10.7 million), 50 shareholders are required, whereas if it is under, only 35 are needed. Nomu issuers will also be prone to higher volatility, as daily fluctuation is limited to +/- 20%, compared to the main market's 10%</p><p>The final key difference between the two relates to transparency and disclosure requirements. While companies listed on both are obliged to provide financial statements quarterly, the parallel market gives its issuers an extra 15 days (45 days total) to disclose their results at the end of each quarter.</p><p>This point is vital, not so much because of the difference itself, but rather because it encourages corporate visibility to a segment where such practices were widely neglected. As Vision 2030 looks to attract foreign capital to Saudi Arabia's largely untapped sectors of the economy, a crucial condition for investors will be to ensure transparency and sound corporate governance. While Nomu's launch has been modest and widely underreported, the broad reforms it will promote amongst SMEs could make it the most important addition to Saudi Arabia's ever-evolving business landscape in years to come. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Saudi Arabia's parallel market, Nomu, will give smaller companies the opportunity to list publically, providing greater resources for the SME sector the government is desperately working to bolster.","","Nomu","nomu-room-for-you","1686","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fast-forward a century and a half and no one blinks an eye when Saudi Arabia produces 10 million bpd—a close second only to Russia's 10.7 million bpd. While fears of “peak oil"" have haunted observers for decades—with one serious publication predicting there are enough reserves to last us just 46.2 more years—two other more pressing, and less predictable, factors have caused energy powerhouses like Saudi Arabia to radically reconfigure their energy-based political-economy: the global post-2014 plunge in oil prices and steadily rising interest in renewables, a trend that may grow from pious initiative to full-blown bad faith necessity sooner than many imagine.</p><p>This has forced, or for now merely encouraged, many crude-dependent economies to adapt alternative means of not only diversifying away from carbons to soften the blow of price shocks, but also to boost renewables in their own domestic consumption. Not one to miss the boat, Saudi Arabia has keenly signed up for both. As part of its Saudi Vision 2030, it has plans to harness wind and solar to produce 9.5GW of renewable energy by 2030, liberalize its fuel market to boost the competitiveness of renewables, shortly unveil the King Salman Renewable Energy Initiative, drastically trim the public sector, and radically boost its mining industry to increase non-carbon contributions to GDP. To be sure, a huge part of its push to shake things up in the oil sector is the much-heralded initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned national oil company, expected to finally go public in 2018. With valuations running as high as USD2 trillion—offloading 5% of which will provide the state coffers a cool USD100 billion—it would be far and away the largest IPO in history.</p><p>Taken together, the government hopes these measures will equip both an economy and society that have long grown used to holding 16% of the world's proven petroleum reserves to at least mentally prepare for a post-carbon century. In a country where 87% of budget revenues, 42% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings come from black gold, the successful implementation of Vision 2030 could not come soon enough. Impressive though they are, much of these long-term initiatives still rest upon short- and medium-term assumptions: that the price of oil will at least partially recover to pre-2015 levels. Such is the reasoning behind the policy-making decisions of Khaled al-Falih, appointed in May 2016 by the bullish Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to give the Kingdom a far more active role in shaping the global price of crude through output manipulation and targeted production cuts.</p><h4>Oil</h4><p>Much ink has been spilt on the game-changing nature of Mohammad bin Salman's staggering rise to leading Saudi Arabia into a brave new bristling world. Indeed, since the crown prince appointed Al Falih as Minster of Energy, the Kingdom has quickly reversed its decades-long policy of non intervention in shaping the price of oil and worked behind the scenes with producers in and out of OPEC to target specific levels.</p><p>In November 2016, a Saudi-led OPEC confounded skeptics and announced the body's first production cuts in eight years, a move that immediately drove the price of oil up from USD45.26/barrel to USD52.62 within a month of being announced. To the surprise of many, Saudi Arabia was able to convince non-OPEC members like Russia to join the cut. Given that the later was producing at historic post-Soviet rates of over 10 million barrels/day—and the ruble had far from rebounded to pre-2015 levels—this was no small feat. While Saudi agreed to reduce output by 486,000 barrels/day, OPEC's second-largest member, Iraq, agreed to cut production by 210,000, while the UAE and Kuwait agreed to 139,000 and 131,000, respectively. Coming in at the second-largest cut of any producer, Russia agreed to reduce output by 300,000. This initial cut was to last six months, with the likelihood of being extended another half-year once OPEC met again in May 2017.</p><p>Yet the second time round, OPEC decided to extend the cuts into March 2018. For one, this was because prices had yet to gravitate up to the sought-upon rates. Between November 30, 2016 and April 30, 2017, the price had not budged from USD52/barrel, and by the beginning of June the price had actually plunged to USD47/barrel—though part of which was spurred by Donald Trump's announcement that the US was pulling out of the Paris climate accords. Despite this hopefully momentary dip, OPEC and its partners have committed to reducing total output by 1.8 million barrels/day through March 2018, a move they hope will not be circumvented by record rates of production in the US—and reduction exemptions for Libya and Nigeria, the two OPEC members not obliged to follow suit.</p><h4>Diversification</h4><p>After earning a record USD920 billion in 2012, OPEC countries scraped by with a relatively paltry USD341 billion in 2016. If leading producers like Saudi Arabia want to make up this for this shortfall, they will have to start getting more creative. Apart from a huge initiative to boost the Saudi mining industry, long thought to have vast untold amounts of aluminum, phosphate, gold, and copper, not to mention some 6% of the world's uranium, one of the biggest aspects of the government's Saudi Vision 2030 plan is the Aramco IPO, the proceeds of which will fund the Saudi Public Investment Fund, soon to be the biggest in the world. Once established, this fund will invest “in large international companies and emerging technologies from around the world"" as a means of weaning the Kingdom off black gold and onto less exhaustible sources of sustenance.<br>Part and parcel of the wider attempt to diversify are the Kingdom's plans to increase the localization of the oil and gas sectors from 40% to 75% as part of Vision 2030. Not only will this boost local employment, it will also prevent that much more in wages from being repatriated overseas. More striking, however, are Vision 2030's plans to boost renewable energy sources in the Kingdom. Admitting quite frankly that the Kingdom ""still lack[s] a competitive renewable energy sector at present,"" its initial target is to generate 9.5GW of renewable energy through solar and wind. German firm Phoenix Solar seems to have already gotten a head start with two solar panel parks that have gone up on the grounds of the national petroleum research center in Riyadh. Erected in 2012 and 2014, respectively, the 3.5MW and 1.8MW solar parks were ordered by Saudi Aramco.</p><p>A critical part of this effort to diversify the Kingdom's energy mix is the King Salman Renewable Energy Initiative, yet to be unveiled but which will outline the contours of the effort to reach 9.5GW of renewables. As Vision 2030 states, a critical aspect of this will be to “localize a significant portion of the renewable energy value chain in the Saudi economy,"" including research and development. It will also contain an extensive review of the “legal and regulatory framework that allows the private sector to buy and invest in the renewable energy sector,"" thus encouraging Saudi firms to play a leading role in the long-term renewable transformation of their energy matrix. In tandem with their efforts in fossil fuels, the country has ambitious plans to localize the renewables industry as it develops and encourage public-private partnerships to help it do so along the way.</p><h4>Up or down</h4><p>The biggest question throughout the rest of the year will be the extent to which Minister Al Falih's predictions regarding crude oil inventories and global demand prove true. If correct that inventories are in global decline, Riyadh's move to scale back production through March 2018 should pay handsomely. So far, however, the evidence has been shaky at best. As of March 2017, US stockpiles were 20% over their five-year average, and a 5.4 million barrel reduction of crude inventories in Europe was offset by increases in gasoline and middle distillates, notes Bloomberg, and Chinese stockpiles are only growing.</p><p>At the end of the day, the Saudi-led OPEC cuts that went into effect in November 2016 have had virtually no effect on American output, which, if anything, has only increased and is expected to do so by 740,000 barrels by December 2017. Not unsurprisingly, and in tandem with Libya and Nigeria's exemptions from the production cuts, this is only likely to stabilize or offset rather than increase global oil prices and decrease Saudi's total market share. When OPEC members met in late May to extend the oil cuts, the price of crude actually fell by 5%. And though crude exports to the US were down in May by 160,000 barrels to 840,000, this merely brought them back to levels last seen in January when the cuts first went into effect. At the end of the day, if Minister al-Falih is to pull off the first concerted effort to scale down crude in several decades, it will have to start with depriving the Kingdom's American customers in a more real and substantial fashion. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/fc99145c-f629-453d-954f-0dd8ed1e0e4f.jpg","","","","The Kingdom has made renewables a critical aspect of its ambitious Vision 2030 effort to diversify its economy and wean itself from a strictly carbon-based diet, not to mention empower local businesses and individuals to take up the mantle and lead the energy sector into the next generation.","","","a-crude-awakening","1887","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784058","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Having witnessed its most-prized commodity in free-fall for the better part of two years, the Kingdom was taking a proactive role in challenging crude's “new normal"" by curbing iats own production. At the same time, to the surprise of observers and ianvestors alike, the world's biggest exporter of crude is putting a plan into action to shift the Kingdom's dependency on oil and look to a far greener future.</p><p>Speaking at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi in mid-January 2017, Al Falih revealed the Kingdom's ambition to launch “the most attractive, competitive, and well executed government renewable energy investment program in the world."" Headed by the Ministry's Renewable Energy Project Development Office, the program is expected to attract up to USD50 billion in renewable-related investments by 2023 and effectively transform the nation's energy matrix.</p><p>Due to a rapidly rising population and its impact, above all, on local desalination and cooling demand, Saudi's power needs grow at an average of 8% each year. As such, the Ministry of Energy, Industry, and Mineral Resources has been exploring ways to diversify the matrix, thereby freeing-up more of its oil for export. As outlined by the Vision 2030, wind, solar, and nuclear energy are set to play a fundamental role in this as the Kingdom targets renewables to contribute up to 9.5GW to the national energy mix by 2023, or approximately 10% of total usage. According to the plan, upcoming projects to be launched by the Ministry could develop 3.45GW of power from renewable sources by 2020, nearly 4% of consumption. Such ambitions, however, represent a drastic transformation in Saudi's energy sector, as establishing a framework and timeline for such reforms is a daunting task; renewables' production currently stands at a mere 25 MW, contributing less than 1% to the energy mix.</p><p>Thus, on February 21, 2017 Minister Al Falih officially kicked-off the USD50 billion renewable push by inviting investors interested in developing up to 700MW of wind or solar power in the Kingdom to submit their bids by March 20. This round will focus on two specific projects: a 400MW wind plant in the northeast province of Tabuk and a 300MW solar farm at Sakaka, Al Jouf province. In an emailed statement, the Ministry explained that bidders who qualify past the first round would be able to present their proposals from April through July.<br>One company almost certain to take advantage of the upcoming renewable energy tender is Acwa Power. Based in Riyadh, the provider has branched out of the Kingdom to become a leader in power, water, and renewable energy across the Middle East and today conducts over half of its business in the wider region. Yet, looking ahead, the company is eager to tap-up the vast opportunities that the government's renewables push could bring. Speaking exclusively to TBY, Acwa Power CEO Paddy Padmanathan explained, “for Saudi Arabia, this year is a dramatic change from the last five. In 2016, there was a clear vision being set out in the form of Vision 2030, which was quickly followed through with the 2020 transition plan. What is exciting is that it is a detailed plan with a lot of key deliverables. In terms of new tenders, we expect to see a few new big renewables (projects) launched here in the Kingdom. There is a lot going on and it is an exciting period.""<br>With the OPEC supply cut in full-swing, crude prices stabilizing above the USD50 mark, and following a record renewables investment program just launched, Saudi's energy strategy suggests that the grass may just prove greener on the other side. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Saudi Arabia is preparing to invest heavily in its green energy sector with the intention not only of cushioning itself against the fall in oil prices, but becoming an outright global leader.","","Renewables","green-is-the-new-black-saudi-arabia-2017","1497","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58f615b486b7b00ce8946aa8","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only is the Kingdom considered one of the hottest, driest countries on the face of the Earth, but it is also the largest country without a single river running through its arid land. Moreover, with the local population set to increase by 25%, to 39 million, by the landmark year 2030, quenching Saudi's thirst is increasingly becoming a question of national security. </p><p>“But where there's a challenge, there's an opportunity,"" said the Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, Abdul Rahman Al-Fadli, on the sidelines of the Water Investment Forum. The minister inaugurated the two-day event, held in Riyadh in November 2016, with one strong message: Saudi's water industry would be opening its doors to private investors, and foreign capital is more than invited. Specifically, the newly merged ministry has set a target to double the volume of desalinated water produced in the Kingdom over the next 15 years. The desalination method accounts for the vast majority of water consumed in Saudi, with 29 operational plants pumping 4.6 million cubic meters daily. Yet, according to sources within the Ministry, in order to double production capacity, the industry is looking to attract up to USD53 billion in the coming years.<br>A major beneficiary to these reforms will be the Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC), the government's entity responsible for desalinating seawater; also, incidentally, the biggest of its kind in the world. Speaking exclusively to The Business Year, SWCC Acting-Governor Ali Al-Hazmi highlighted the pace of these reforms by explaining that the Kingdom is aiming for 52% of desalinated water to be produced through strategic partners by 2020. For Al Hazmi, the former Sasref president brought in weeks before the investment forum to kickstart and oversee the privatization process, the challenge starts immediately. First, he argues, the organization must clean up its own act before it presents itself to investors, “As one would his own car before putting it on sale."" Thus, throughout 2017 “we expect to continue improving the efficiency of SWCC plants, meeting the needs of our customers, and planning for future water demand. SWCC will continue to accelerate plans to prepare for its commercial role."" Specifically, this will include “improving mechanical ability by 11% and the utilization of our facilities from 82-93% over the next 12 months.""<br>By the end of March 2017, Al Hazmi expects to present a business plan to the minister, which will detail SWCC's future expansion and will be the private sector's cue to enter. “Many firms are interested, and we want to see a multinational consortium investing in the project. It would be good for the Kingdom because these firms would bring competition and high technical knowledge and standards.

The fall in oil prices had a significant effect on the Kingdom's fiscal situation, and led to fiscal consolidation, uncertainty in the lending markets, and international concern over the state of Saudi banks. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the Kingdom's central bank, has taken aggressive steps to stabilize the fiscal system; initiating a stimulus package to support lenders and extending policies designed to increase consumers' access to credit. The government has also entered global debt markets for the first time with a record-breaking bond issuance that helped boost the sector and reminded international participants of the Kingdom's unmatched potential. Going forward, continued careful management of the sector's loan rations and currency valuation will be needed to establish the conditions needed for economic success regardless of the price of oil.</p><h4>SECTOR OVERVIEW</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's commercial banking sector had 12 listed banks (four of which are sharia compliant) as of 4Q2016 and a total of SAR2.26 trillion (USD690 million) in total assets, up 2.2% from 4Q2015. Total deposits rose 0.8% YoY to SAR1.62 trillion (USD432 billion) in 4Q2016. The Kingdom's economic slowdown can be seen in the reduced growth rate of loans in the banking sector; the total volume of loans grew 2.9% over the same period in 2015, the lowest rate since the 2009 recession. Half of all new loans extended had maturities of less than a year, but the medium-term loan sector actually saw significant growth, with one-to-three-year loans rising 9.7% YoY. Loan activity in key sectors slowed compared to recent years but still grew at a moderate rate; corporate real estate loans grew by 14.3% YoY, solid but well below the 54.1% growth figure posted in 2015. Retail real estate loans grew 8.2% in the same period. Though the non-performing loan ratio rose from 1.13% in 3Q2015 to 1.24% in 4Q2016, the industry's overall coverage ratio went from 169% to 175%, a mark of the overall health of the sector. Despite the mixed performance in some areas, the banking sector overall posted a 3.8% increase in income. Most of this came from retail and treasury income, which increased by 7.9% and 1.2% YoY, respectively, and counteracted the 0.8% fall in corporate sector earnings and a 11.7% drop in investment services income.<br>The sector's strong indicators and stability even in the face of decreased economic performance combined with SAMA's actions have given the international financial community confidence in the sector's future. In March 2017, rating agency Moody's revised its outlook for the Saudi banking sector to stable from negative, reporting that it projected the Saudi economy to recover despite low oil prices. Government spending aimed at diversifying the economy and improving consumer confidence is expected to keep the banks in a stronger financial position than their regional peers despite continued economic stagnation in 2017.</p><h4>SAUDI ARABIA MONETARY AGENCY</h4><p>SAMA, the Kingdom's central bank and financial regulator, has taken active steps to support the banking sector in the midst of the current economic slowdown. 2016 saw the arrival of new lending rules and cash transfers from the government to commercial banks, to increase liquidity and stimulate economic activity in the market. Mid-2016 saw interbank rates—the exchange rate of short-term loans between banks—rise to their highest levels since the 2009 recession, a measure of the liquidity squeeze facing the sector. In February 2016, SAMA raised the percentage of deposits that Saudi banks could lend from 85% to 90% in an attempt to increase the flow of credit into the economy. The rate was raised again to 90.5% in July, as demand for credit increased, SAMA made USD5.3 billion available to the banking industry at a discounted rate while at the same time loosening its lending regulations. This came at a particularly important time for the Saudi economy; the government eliminated bonuses and cut salaries for civil workers, dramatically reducing the take-home pay for the majority of all working Saudis. In the face of this reduced consumer purchasing power, increasing liquidity in the credit market was crucial to the health of the Saudi economy.</p><p>By all metrics, SAMA's actions were successful. After stagnating in the first half of the year, the commercial banking sector saw deposits rise slightly YoY, as referenced above. The upgrading of the nation's outlook rating reflects global belief in the fundamental soundness of the sector and SAMA's ability to take further action as needed. Early 2017 has brought more good news for the sector's financial health. A recovery in the price of oil has increased revenues, putting more money into the Saudi economy by allowing the government to reverse some of its previous austerity cuts. In April 2017, King Salman reinstated the bonuses that were cut in late 2016 while maintaining the relaxed lending requirements instituted around the same time. A falling interbank ration and continued growth in lending rates served as additional positive indicators that the sector was moving in the right direction. There are still reasons for concern about the Kingdom's fiscal situation—the government deficit is expected to persist for the near future, and the price of oil remains a long-term concern—but the foundation appears to be stable.</p><h4>FOREIGN BONDS</h4><p>As part of its strategy to increase liquidity, SAMA issued its first sovereign bonds in October 2016. The issue marked the first time since the 1980s that the Saudi government looked to international sources to help finance its fiscal deficit, and was the first time it had issued sovereign bonds. It was a landmark entry—the Kingdom raised USD17.5 billion, the largest debut in history and more than USD1.5 billion beyond what Saudi officials expected to raise. The size and scale of the issue reflected global investor interest in Saudi debt and confidence in the Kingdom's economic future. Demand was high enough that the yields for the five-, 10-, and 30-year bonds offered actually ended below expectations, but it made no difference; the sale was an unqualified success that left both Saudi officials and global investors satisfied. Significantly, the Kingdom's debut on the global debt markets marks another step in the economy's larger move toward privatization. Improved global relationships with investors and adherence to international transparency standards have helped the sector become more structured, increased credibility, and increased the Kingdom's desirability in the eyes of global markets. The banking sector should gain new opportunities with the looming arrival of private firms into the energy, construction, and services industries, and the preexisting relationships in the global credit markets formed by this initial bond offering will undoubtedly be valuable as the Kingdom moves toward its long-term economic goals.</p><p>Encouraged by this first issue, SAMA and the Saudi government have made it clear that they will return to global debt markets to finance the fiscal deficit and bolster the banking sector's liquidity. In April 2017, the Saudi government launched its first sukuk, or Islamic bond, issue. Worth USD9 billion, sukuk bonds are a sharia-compliant alternative to traditional interest-bearing bonds that have become a popular financial tool in Islamic countries. As with the first issuance, the money raised will be used to finance the rapidly shrinking deficit and, in theory, allow the Kingdom to prevent burning through its foreign currency reserves. Yet despite the success of the April sukuk issuance, SAMA's report for May 2017 stated that Saudi Arabia's net foreign assets had fallen below USD500 billion for the first time in six years. The IMF's warning about the long-term financial health of the country after reserves began to fall in 2014 was one of the primary factors behind the government's austerity cuts, but this fall indicates that either an increase in the economic growth rate or further spending cuts may be needed to stabilize the Kingdom's financial situation. Global financial markets expect additional bond issuance within the next year, and the Kingdom is still well above the reserve levels where new currency policies would have to be implemented, but the rate at which Saudi Arabia is going through cash is still something markets will keep an eye on.</p><h4>CURRENCY<br></h4><p>The riyal's peg to the dollar has remained constant throughout the recent period of change in the sector, but concerns over the Kingdom's economic performance have led to speculation as to whether this policy might end. The riyal is fixed at SAR3.75 per dollar, and SAMA and government officials have publicly expressed confidence in the Saudi economy's ability to handle currency speculation, stating that they have no plans to de-peg. As the Kingdom's economy slowed in early 2016, some domestic traders began to bet on devaluation, but SAMA condemned the practice and launched a series of probes seeking to shut down this activity. The bond sales in late 2016 alleviated many immediate fears of devaluation, but concerns still persist. The Saudi Consumer Price Index fell 0.4% in January 2017, the first month of deflation since 2005. This came about in large part due to the growing strength of the dollar, which made the food imports that Saudi Arabia depends on more expensive. Deflation reached three consecutive months in May 2017 even in the face of slightly improved economic activity, but government officials remained positive about the long-term outlook of the riyal and the wider economy. Planned increases in prices by way of new value-added and “sin"" taxes should help increase prices, and upcoming energy subsidy cuts should have the same effect.

"2017-09-29T12:31:00.000Z","2017-09-29T12:31:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Working Women","<p>Introducing new job opportunities for women and increasing female employment rates to 30%, as well as emphasizing their leading role in the socio-economic development, is a major part of the Vision's plan. As of 2016, female employment in the Kingdom stood at 22%,  and women are typically employed in a limited range of sectors, such as education.</p><p>Some of the major challenges that the government is facing on its way to female labor empowerment include creating a suitable work environment, given the country's laws on gender-mixing. Compounding this challenge, women have historically found difficulties entering the workforce due to not being able to drive and guardianship laws. Though in recent years, the government has introduced unprecedented regulatory changes to encourage women's participation in the labor market.</p><p>Namely, it has expanded the list of sectors in which females can work to include pharmaceuticals, retail, hospitality, and law. Likewise, in May 2017, a royal decree officially relaxed guardianship laws to allow women to seek employment without the permission of their male guardian. Additionally, the government pushed a requirement for companies with over 15 female employees that they must have a child care center and increase maternity leave to 10 weeks.</p><p>As so much of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 focuses on enabling growth in the private sector, a large part of these reforms will specifically target female employment in this segment. As such, the government has partnered with companies like Glowork, whose task is to connect highly educated Saudi women to various job opportunities. The firm hires 28 women daily and interviews 4,000 women weekly, on average. Speaking exclusively to TBY, Glowork's CEO Khalid Alkhudair explained that the company “was among the first to hire women in the retail industry five years ago. We have also managed to establish a virtual office tool for women living in rural areas to work remotely, which is now a part of Vision 2030. Today, as many as 200,000 women work from their homes in the private sector. Currently, Glowork is working on an online application which would allow women to be hired through social media platforms, based on data from their social network activities.“</p><p>The Saudi government has also created fertile ground for an entertainment industry, which is opening new possibilities for Saudi women in screenwriting, film production, and animation. This spring, the Jeddah-based Effat University is having its first graduating class of female filmmaker bachelor's degree holders in visual and digital production. The all-female university's program is developing Saudia Arabia's budding film industry, and graduates should occupy about 30% of available film production jobs. Those who do not enter existing positions will likely create their own companies, also becoming entreprenurs or working as freelancers.<br>The finance industry is also seeing progress towards women's increased participation in the workforce. Within a one-week timespan in February 2017, three top jobs in banking and finance were filled by women. Samba Financial Group, one of Saudi Arabia's top banks, appointed Rania Nashar as CEO; Arab National Bank appointed Latifa Al Sabhan as CFO; and the country's stock exchange named Sarah Al Suhaimi as chairman. Al Suhaimi is also the CEO of NCB Capital investment bank.</p><p>However, women in influential positions are not enough, and more needs to be done to address the gender-gap in employment. In addition to addressing legislation to allow women to seek employment, women need to further develop their skills before entering the work force. Approximately 60% of all university graduates are women, and according to Glowork's CEO, many of them have difficulties finding jobs because they do not possess the right skill set to apply their knowledge from academia into the workforce. In other words, universities need to cater their programs to better meet women's professional needs. Women's increased productivity and participation will spark investments and job creation, contributing to Saudi Arabia's economy and Vision 2030. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Women’s Employment under Vision 2030","working-women","2136","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And while over the decades the Kingdom has edged closer to a more economically sustainable future, no initiative to-date has been as comprehensive, purposeful and detailed as the Vision 2030, presented in 2015 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, TBY took the opportunity to ask business leaders across Saudi Arabia about their confidence in the Vision, and specifically why they felt it differed to previous government efforts. </p><p>Overwhelmingly, the answer lied in detail; that is, the careful consideration and accuracy placed on each aspect of the reforms, their projected impact on various sectors of the economy, and the micro steps taken to achieve these goals. In particular, one initiative stood out—the National Transformation Program (NTP) 2020.<br>According to the 112-page document, launched by the Crown Prince in June 2016, “The National Transformation Program was developed to help fulfill Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and to identify the challenges faced by government bodies in the economic and development sectors… The program identifies, each year, the initiatives necessary for achieving such goals and devises detailed plans on the basis of interim indicators that measure and monitor performance.“</p><p>Checks and balances aside, the NTP introduces a number of initiatives—543 to be precise —across 24 government entities to the tune of SAR200 billion (USD53.3 billion), of which 40% is projected to be funded by the private sector.<br>Private sector engagement indeed remains at the core of the four-year plan, and “strengthening cooperation“ between government and private bodies is listed as a key objective towards nearing Vision 2030 goal of increasing the private sector's contribution to GDP to 65%. This objective is closely followed by contributing to job creation, more specifically creating over 450,000 jobs in the non-governmental sector by 2020. The third key objective of the NTP relates to an issue particularly affecting the industrial, manufacturing, and oil and gas sectors: maximizing local sourcing. Energy giant Saudi Aramco is in the second year of its localization initiative, IKTVA, which will aim to boost Aramco's local procurement to 70%. In line with this, the NTP has set a target to “bring home“ up to SAR270 billion (USD71.97 billion) of sourcing across the business landscape. Finally, corresponding to the Vision 2030's commitment toward developing IT infrastructure throughout the Kingdom, the NTP has identified 29 essential initiatives to support a digital transformation.<br>Aside from its core objectives, the NTP also touches upon other industries such as tourism, where it aims to boost the number of Umrah pilgrims from 7 million to 15 million, or mining, which is expected to grow its output from SAR64 billion (USD17 billion) to SAR97 billion (USD25.85 billion) by 2020.<br>All in all, the NTP 2020 is proving to be a vital checkpoint in the Kingdom's path to achieving its Vision 2030 goals. It has set ambitious, yet realistic, guidelines for government entities and the private sector to follow. It has highlighted key sectors to be developed and, in many ways, gives insight into the Kingdom's budgetary priorities up until 2020.<br>Most importantly, however, the NTP is a clear sign that this time around, the government is fully committed to a long-term, sustainable future. By setting clear, detailed goals for economic diversification and private sector cooperation, the Kingdom is drastically reforming its business landscape, making it more expansive and inclusive. Testament to this lies in one of the NTP's most promising projections: to more than double FDI over the next three years, from SAR30 billion (USD8 billion) to SAR70 billion (USD18.66 billion). </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Transformation Program 2020","next-stop-2020","1744","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has witnessed low oil prices eat up USD258 billion from its foreign reserves, a rise in regional tensions fuelled primarily by Iran's reintroduction into the global domain and continued proxy expansionism, and a sense of uncertainty echoing from Washington's new administration.</p><p>These challenges have forced the Saudi leadership, led by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the enthusiastic Crown Prince, HRH Mohammed Bin Salman, to explore fresh opportunities across the Kingdom's sectors, new markets for trade and investment, and an overall foreign policy pivot. And while the month-long Asia tour—the longest of any Saudi monarch—at first glance meets these objectives, it is important to divide these into two separate tranches; that is to say, King Salman's visit to China and Japan satisfied somewhat different goals than his stay in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei.</p><p>In April 2016, the Crown Prince famously launched Vision 2030—a broad-based program that is set to revolutionize the economy from within through reforms such as privatization and widespread economic diversification. A major aspect to the latter includes positioning the Kingdom as a global leader in innovation and technology.</p><p>The go-to destination for the 31-year-old Prince was Japan, and in October 2016 he committed USD45 billion to Tokyo-based SoftBank's “Vision Fund,“ which will invest in the future of technology, including robotics and microchips. As such, King Salman paid the company's CEO, Masayoshi Son, a royal visit during his recent stop to the world's third-largest economy, showing encouraging signs for their bilateral effort to rule the digital waves. More encouraging yet, Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to fully support the Kingdom's effort to diversify its economy by launching a suitably named Japan-Saudi Vision 2030, which will overwhelmingly expand cooperation in energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure.</p><p>From China, the message was typically bold, yet equally strategic and comprehensive. On his first day touching down in Beijing, King Salman wasted no time in tying up USD65 billion worth of deals with President Xi Jinping, primarily in the petrochemicals and energy sectors—a key example of the Kingdom's ability to secure game-changing contracts in its core business amidst ongoing uncertainties in energy markets. And China's significance is both fresh and calculated; it comes after a challenging 2016 when the world's second-biggest economy agreed to expand trade with Iran to a whopping USD600 billion, and the Kingdom (1.02 million barrels per day) was overtaken by Russia (1.05 million bpd) as the biggest oil exporter to China. Yet most importantly perhaps is the fact that Saudi's dealings in China are being spearheaded by heavyweights Aramco and SABIC, at a time when Vision 2030 anticipates the former to undergo a historic USD2 trillion IPO (likely part in Hong Kong), and SABIC—the biggest listed company in the Middle East—reaps the benefits of the vision's goals to revolutionize the downstream petrochemical sector.</p><p>The remaining stopovers on the Asia tour were likewise marked by highly lucrative and strategic deals, with Aramco's USD7 billion investment in Malaysia's state-owned oil giant Petronas' refinery project leading the pack. Yet, there was a clear, underlying geopolitical purpose in King Salman's visit to Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia, the biggest nation in the Islamic world. The fall in oil prices, ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria, coupled with an uncertain tone from long-time ally the US, indirectly leading to Iran's emergence onto the global stage, have unarguably taken a toll on the Kingdom's ability to assert itself on the international arena, instead forcing the leadership to look within for answers to its many challenges.</p><p>Yet in the spirit of the old Chinese proverb in that every crisis lies the seed of opportunity, King Salman's Asia tour delivered just that. Not only was it a testament that widespread reforms were firmly in place and that a farsighted vision had been set-out, but for anyone seriously doubting Saudi Arabia's international stature, this was a message loud and clear that the Kingdom was more than capable of thriving in the new normal, cultivating groundbreaking bonds with the world's fastest growing economies. The significance of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei in this regard is that despite glaring fractures in the Islamic world, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is continuing to lead the sunnah into this new era of unprecedented opportunities and challenges. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Asia Tour","looking-east","1441","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-29T10:33:00.000Z","2017-09-29T10:33:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Here Comes the Sun","<p>The modern history of Saudi Arabia is inextricably linked with petroleum; the 1938 discovery of massive oil reserves under the Arabian desert sparked a half-century of growth that saw it become the world's largest oil exporter and a cornerstone of the global energy economy. But times are changing. Alarmist peak oil predictions have been proven wrong over the past decade, but there's no denying that the landscape has shifted in recent years. A fall in oil prices has forced the Saudi oil industry to increase production to record levels in order to generate the revenue the government needs to function. Well aware of the need to seek alternative energy sources, Saudi Arabia's government is investing heavily in renewables, especially solar and wind. These new energy sources are a natural fit for the Kingdom's geography, and the government's willingness to form new public-private partnerships should lead to more aggressive development in the years to come.</p><h4>GOVERNMENT PUSH</h4><p>Renewable energy currently accounts for less than 1% of Saudi Arabia's production, but the government is taking strides to change that. The Kingdom's Saudi Vision 2030 plan includes growth in renewable energy sources as one of its major targets, setting a goal of increasing energy from renewables to 9.5GW by 2023 and tripling renewable energy output by 2030. 2017 has seen the government continue to lead a push on renewable energy investment; in January, the Saudi Energy Minister announced that the Kingdom would begin taking bids for renewables projects as part of a medium-term investment strategy that will see the Kingdom spend between USD30 and 50 billion by 2023. The first round of bidding took place in 2015 for a series of solar and wind energy projects equaling more than 700MW; the firms awarded the contract will be granted full ownership of the plant, a Saudi first that reflects the government's awareness that new forms of cooperation with the private sector are needed to remain competitive in the energy industry. In the past, the Saudi government has retained tight state control over all elements of the energy industry, but government leaders recognize that this model is no longer sustainable due to the fiscal realities the Kingdom is facing. Firms bidding for new renewables projects are still subject to a stringent set of fiscal and production requirements designed to ensure that the firm has the previous experience needed to succeed in the market, but the move to independent ownership means that the Saudi government is no longer required to make a financial commitment to get these projects off the ground. This is all part of a larger nationwide strategy that's carefully moving toward privatization, and industry participants are largely positive about the new structure.</p><p>An interesting side effect of the government's stringent capital and experience requirements is the creation of new partnerships between local and international firms. The Saudi government requires firms to have more than 1,000MW of renewable energy projects in operation, with at least one-tenth of that in an market outside the firms' home country. Similar policies are in place of solar projects. Since few companies are operating on these scales, industry participants believe that the future of the sector lies in partnerships between local firms that have connections and experience in the Saudi market and international firms that have the size and capital needed to meet the large-scale needs of the Saudi market. Mohammed K. Mudarres, CEO of the Saudi Industrial Services Company, spoke positively about his firm's previous experiences with international partnerships. “While SISCO has a good base of know-how and resources internally… for some major projects it is essential to have the international element of know-how and resources, as well as the investment,"" Mudarres told TBY. “We have had great experiences with our international partnerships so far and we welcome the input that international partners bring."" Saudi Arabia's global prominence and pre-established relationships with major energy companies are key here, as they already have the connections needed to dive right into major projects without struggling with intermediate steps.</p><h4>WIND AND SOLAR</h4><p>Solar and wind energy are poised to take the lead in Saudi Arabia's renewables strategy. The geography of the Arabian desert makes it a natural fit for solar and wind; the Kingdom receives more than 3,000 hours of sunlight annually and as the largest country in the Middle East it holds tremendous potential. The government's Saudi Vision 2030 plan calls for ambitious solar infrastructure development and foresees “yellow oil"" as playing a critical role in the country's industrial infrastructure. As of 2016, Saudi Arabia had only 23MW of installed capacity, but the massive inflow of investment funds planned by the Saudi government is about to change that in a hurry. A number of major projects are underway through both public and private financing. The government is currently seeking bids for a 300MW solar project in Sakaka, located in the north of the Kingdom. ACWA Power International, a Riyadh-based firm, is one of the qualified forms shortlisted for the project. In an interview with TBY, ACWA CEO Paddy Padmanathan praised the “clear vision"" being set by the government and expressed optimism at the future of the solar sector. “Saudi Arabia has fantastic solar resources, land is going to be given at a notional cost, the credit worthiness of the Kingdom is superior to many other countries, and there is a lot of funding capacity here,"" Padmanathan told TBY. “[The new renewables tenders] is going to be a big program that will attract a lot of competitiveness,"" he added. The solar industry is also set to be an essential part of the Kingdom's industrial sector; the government expects its current tenders to generate around 7,000 jobs and become a source of steady domestic revenues through sales of excess energy.<br>Wind, too, is a natural fit for Saudi Arabia's landscape and energy needs. The government announced plans for a 400MW wind plant in Midyan in early 2017 and had shortlisted a handful of firms as of mid-May. The Kingdom's first wind energy turbine was commissioned in early 2017; the project, developed in tandem with American firm GE, installed an 85m high turbine in Turaif. The turbine will provide electricity to a Saudi Aramco facility in the city, generating 2.75MW and saving the equivalent of 19,00 barrels of oil. GE also installed a second turbine in Huraymila, north of Riyadh, and was up and operational as of early 2017. Hisham Al Bahkali, President &amp; CEO of GE Saudi Arabia &amp; Bahrain, was optimistic about the prospect of future wind energy projects in Saudi Arabia. “The Renewable Energy Project Development Office (REPDO)… is drafting the right regulations and working to have a conducive environment for private companies to contribute to the Renewables sector,"" Bahkali told TBY. “GE is proud to contribute to this and to be a part of clean energy projects in the Kingdom.""</p><h4>NUCLEAR</h4><p>Saudi Arabia's plan for new sources of energy also calls for the construction of two commercial nuclear reactors. After signing nuclear energy cooperation agreements with several countries, the Saudi government began more in-depth studies last year and met with the China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) to explore future nuclear plans. While still in early stages, the government expects the nuclear reactors to have a generation capacity of 2.8GW. In the longer term, the Saudi government has discussed ambitions plans to build 16 nuclear reactors over the next 25 years, an investment of more than USD80 billion. As with solar, the Saudi government is leveraging its preexisting international relationships to build the foundation for this industry; the government is working closely with Russia to develop joint energy projects, and a delegation of Saudi leaders went to Argentina for nuclear energy training as part of an agreement formed between the two countries.</p><h4>THE FUTURE OF OIL</h4><p>The great irony in Saudi Arabia's renewable energy efforts is that the future of the nation's oil industry may well depend on the success of its renewable energy program. The rapid population increase of recent years has strained the Kingdom's energy grid, forcing the government to draw more energy from burning oil. “Average growth has been around 7-8% for the past three decades,"" before shrinking for the first time in 2016, Deputy Minister for Electricity Saleh Alawaji told TBY, and the amount of oil burned for power has risen to 80,000bpd in recent years. After decades of subsidies, the Saudi government raised energy prices to curb demand and is embarking on a crusade to increase efficiency. A study commissioned by the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center called increased efficiency critical to the future of the Kingdom's oil industry, concluding that improving efficiency by 4% a year would save 1 million bpd of crude oil by 2030. With domestic oil consumption continuing to increase at approximately 4% more than the rate of oil production, increasing the supply of renewable energy is more than a societal goal; it's economically necessary. With a deep roster of renewable investments currently under development, though, it looks like the process of moving to a more sustainable energy future is well underway. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/80869ce5-b0c5-4656-acd6-0cf132f02348.jpg","","","","Saudi Arabia is fast becoming a leader in green energy thanks to an ambitious government plan that seeks to take advantage of the Kingdom's natural resources and relationships with private energy firms.","","","here-comes-the-sun-saudi-arabia-2017","2067","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58f615b486b7b00ce8946aa8","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-29T09:17:00.000Z","2017-09-29T09:17:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Make Friends, Not Enemies","<p>The historic visit of US President Donald Trump to Riyadh on May 20 marked a new chapter in Saudi-US ties, and indeed a new era of the Kingdom's standing within the Islamic world.  </p><p>Under the slogan 'Together we prevail,' Trump's decision to make Riyadh the primary stop on his first overseas trip as President was a sign of intent that the Middle East would be his administration's core foreign policy objective and that Saudi would be its most valuable and trusted partner. For the Kingdom's part, this was an opportunity to lead the region—including heads of state and representatives from 55 Islamic nations—into the most important discussions of our generation.</p><p>Not long after Trump's Air Force One landed on Riyadh's tarmac it became clear that the visit would deliver an unprecedented, sector-wide economic package and that the proceedings would be as much about numbers and action, as they were about the strong rhetoric. On May 20, the CEOs of over 50 leading US companies, 40 Saudi firms, and nine other business from key international markets convened at Riyadh's Four Seasons Hotel for the Saudi-US CEO Forum. The highlights from the event involved a number of private-sector partnerships, including a USD15 billion MoU with General Electric (GE), a USD3.6 billion deal with Honeywell, and a USD2.8 billion venture with Texas-based EPC provider McDermott, to support Saudi Aramco's widespread localization efforts and the development of SMEs throughout the country—amongst many others.</p><p>Yet, nothing echoed louder than the USD110 billion deal the two countries signed in the defense sector. According to the US State Department, the agreement is effective immediately and falls into five broad categories: air force modernization, air and missile defense, border security and counterterrorism, maritime and coastal security, and cyber security and communications upgrades. This also included a 'letter of intent' to assemble 150 Lockheed Martin Blackhawk helicopters in Saudi Arabia, with a value of USD6 billion. Even more spectacularly, however, the two countries secured an additional USD350 billion agreement over the next 10 years, making it the biggest arms deal in history. Little wonder, therefore, that President Trump left his meeting with Crown Prince HRH Mohammed Bin Naif remarking that “this was a tremendous day for investments in the United States.""</p><p>There was also a clear strategic tone to these dealings. On the closing day of the event, HRH King Salman bin Abdulaziz chaired the Arab-Islamic-US Summit, aimed at combating extremism and terrorism and achieving regional peace, stability, and development. Speaking on behalf of the leaders of 55 Islamic nations and the US President, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques explained that “as part of our war against terrorism, we confirm our determination to wipe out Daesh organization and other terrorist organizations, regardless of their religion, sect or thought."" In conclusion of the event, the participants agreed upon the 'Riyadh Declaration,' which will form a reserve of 34,000 soldiers from across the region to combat terrorism.</p><p>The spectacular arrival of President Trump to Riyadh served as the most welcome refresh in US-Saudi ties, following years of uncertainty during the Obama administration. However, perhaps even more importantly, it opened up a new chapter in Saudi Arabia's outreach across Arab and Islamic nations. As witnessed earlier in the year with HRH King Salman's month-long Asia trip, Saudi has been actively forging an expansive, diversified foreign policy from Indonesia in the east to Washington in the West. Yet, closer to home, many parts of the Arab world remain in socio-political, if not security, turmoil.</p><p>Hosting the leaders of these nations, including Egypt's President Adel Fattah el-Sisi, Jordan's King Abdullah, Iraqi President Fouad Massoum, Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and the heads of each of the GCC states under the patronage of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and the leader of the free world President Trump, was an unprecedented display of unity. <br>Moreover, it has placed Riyadh at the center of the global fight against terrorism, the struggle to contain Iran's aggression, and the future stability and peace in the Middle East. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The Riyadh summit clearly demonstrated that the Middle East would be the US administration's core foreign policy objective and that Saudi would be its most valuable partner.","","All Eyes on Riyadh","make-friends-not-enemies","1408","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-29T08:20:00.000Z","2017-09-29T08:20:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Arabian Might","<p>Saudi Arabia has made its presence known in the Middle East in recent years. The region's richest state has played a significant role in international affairs; dealing with political instability in Yemen and Syria, forming new trade and investment agreements with a host of countries, and hosting the new US president on his first foreign trip are just a few of the moments where the Kingdom has been on the international stage. Throughout it all, a few overarching principles are present in the Kingdom's international dealings: controlled growth in the petroleum marketplace, regional stability, and the establishment of new partnerships to help build skills and ensure a stable future for the domestic economy. The execution of this new strategy hasn't been without its bumps, as tensions have increased with some Gulf neighbors, but the appointment of Mohammed bin Salman as the Kingdom's new crown prince demonstrates that Saudi Arabia is committed to its a long-term vision.</p><h4>OPEC</h4><p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is one of Saudi Arabia's oldest and most important international commitments. The Kingdom was one of the five founding members in 1960 and ever since has played a major role in OPEC's stated mission of coordinating petroleum policies in order to ensure a stable global supply and a fair market for producers and consumers. Throughout the years, OPEC's primary modus operandi has been setting oil production targets to deal with supply disruptions or rising prices. This has been extremely successful throughout the years, but recent events have brought newfound stress to the organization. After years of rising oil prices, a rise in US shale oil production and decreased demand from China and Europe sent prices plummeting in 2014. The fall had dramatic effects on the revenues of OPEC's smaller countries, which sought to collectively limit supply, but Saudi Arabia, which had the wealth and production capacity to increase output and wait out the spell in prices, rejected such a proposal. After additional decreases in the price of oil, however, Saudi Arabia led the proposal of a 1.8 million bpd cut in November 2016, the first since 2008.</p><p>Early 2017 saw the Kingdom produce below even these agreed-upon levels as the price of oil continued to stagnate. In May 2017, OPEC and a group of non-members that included Russia announced the extension of these preexisting 1.8 million bpd production cuts in a sign that the country understands the importance of long-term cuts. This was a major step forward, but OPEC and the larger petroleum industry are still facing long-term challenges. Shale oil production isn't going anywhere; the US oil industry has grown significantly over the last few years thanks to advances in technology that have increased the stock of available reserves. The growth in production from this side has counteracted the drop in Saudi and OPEC production; the US government has forecasted that production will increase by 1 million barrels YoY by December 2017. Such a rise would dramatically alter the effectiveness of OPEC's oil cut. Saudi Arabia also faces continued tensions within the organization; the Kingdom's initial decision to raise production in the face of falling prices in 2014 allowed it to maintain revenues but damaged its relationships with OPEC's smaller members. By blocking an agreement and continuing to raise production, Saudi Arabia flexed its financial muscle but deeply harmed other members; fiscal and political issues in Venezuela and Nigeria are attributable in no small part to the fall in oil prices over the past three years. Recognizing the nature of the shifting geopolitical situation, Saudi Arabia has recently begun a forming a new oil relationship with Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter. The leaders of the two country's oil firms met for the first time in May 2017, marking a sea change from the rivalry and lack of communication that characterized their previous relationship over the last several years. The new lines of dialog opened up between the two countries reflects shared understanding that collaboration is necessary to succeed in the new global oil environment.</p><h4>REGIONAL POWER</h4><p>Saudi Arabia, long a key participant in the Middle East's various diplomatic processes, has taken an even more active role in the region over the past year. The Kingdom's status as one of the central players in the region can be seen in its designation as the site of the first foreign visit of the new US administration. In his visit, President Trump affirmed Saudi Arabia's role as the United States' main ally in the region and indicated that the US would continue to provide political and economic support to the Kingdom. President Trump also announced the finalization of a USD110 billion arms deal that is part of a larger commitment by the Saudis to purchase USD350 billion of US arms over a period of 10 years. The package is the largest military deal yet between the two countries and represents a significant step forward in Saudi Arabia's military capabilities. Government officials also signed investment agreements with private US firms worth more than USD200 billion during the deal. These private deals included partnerships on healthcare, energy, finance, and defense, and were portrayed as a key part of the Kingdom's Saudi Vision 2030 plan by government officials. The goal, Saudi officials said, was to strengthen and diversify the Kingdom's domestic economy, creating a stable infrastructure that provides labor and sources of domestic revenue. An estimated 10,000 jobs are expected to be created by the energy investments alone, and the looming growth of the Saudi private sector is expected to create new opportunities for the international financial industry.</p><h4>YEMEN CONFLICT</h4><p>The landmark weapons deal comes at a particularly eventful moment, as the Kingdom is currently leading a military intervention in Yemen. In early 2015, Houthi rebels overthrew President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, taking control of capital city Sana'a and surrounding regions. Saudi Arabia, seeking to restore Hadi's government, led a international military offensive that has brought together forces from Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE, among others, in seeking to defeat the Houthi rebels and return Hadi to power. The Kingdom has also been a leader in the implementation of a naval and air blockade. Despite the military might of the Saudi-led coalition, the conflict has dragged on, illustrating the complexities of the region. From a larger geopolitical standpoint, the conflict has been described by many as a proxy war; Saudi Arabia claims Iran is supporting the Houthi rebels, and its desire to maintain political influence over the Arabian Peninsula is doubtless one of the Kingdom's primary motivators for the conflict. </p><h4>QATAR</h4><p>Yemen is hardly the only place where tensions exist on the Peninsula. In early June 2017, the Saudi government surprised the international community by cutting diplomatic relations with Qatar, claiming it was destabilizing the region by lending support to militants. The move, coordinated with Egypt, the UAE, and Bahrain, led to the immediate expulsion of Qatari citizens and diplomats, the suspension of all exports, and the closing of airspace, land, and sea borders between the two countries. While the move's stated purpose reflects Saudi Arabia's commitment to ending terrorism in the region, as with Yemen, there are broader forces at work. It is widely believed that the Qatari government's growing diplomatic ties with Iran and Iranian-backed groups were a motivating factor for the decision. If so, this is yet another example of Saudi Arabia moving to reduce Iranian political and economic influence on the peninsula—a somewhat understandable goal.</p><h4>NEW LEADERSHIP, NEW CONNECTIONS</h4><p>In naming Mohammed bin Salman the new crown prince in late June 2017, King Salman made a clear statement about the new tack the Kingdom will be taking with regard to diplomatic issues. Just 31 years old, Mohammed bin Salman has played a significant part in the Kingdom's dealings with Qatar and Yemen in his role as defense minister, as well as leading economic reform efforts as the head of the council of economic and developmental affairs. It's a daunting portfolio, but the Crown Prince has proved able to balance both domestic and international concerns. There has been debate within the Kingdom about the best path forward, but Mohammed bin Salman's ever more visible role as a leading government representative in meetings with foreign industry and foreign leaders demonstrated his growing influence in the Saudi government. Because of this, the royal decree announcing bin Salman's ascendance to crown prince was unexpected but in keeping with Saudi Arabia's new direction over the last few years move. </p><p>With this long-term vision in mind, the Kingdom is continuing to form new international relationships and strengthen preexisting ones. Under bin Salman's leadership as defense minster, the Saudi government has begun to work more closely with Israel in accomplishing their shared goal of fighting Islamic extremism. During his Middle East tour, President Trump made the first-ever flight from Riyadh to Tel Aviv, a telling symbolic gesture that reflects the burgeoning relationship between the two countries. The Saudi government has been aggressive in forming new bilateral ties to boost investment and create new avenues for R&amp;D. Indonesia, India, Japan, and the Philippines are just a few of the countries that Saudi leaders have visited in 2017, signing agreements that range from labor cooperation policies with the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment to petrochemical investment agreements with the Japanese government. The Crown Prince has also taken a public role in forming international partnerships, meeting with world and industry leaders in places ranging from Silicon Valley to Moscow. The overarching theme of all these agreements is a commitment to diversifying the economy and creating new networks for trade with the aim of developing a stronger Saudi Arabia. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/76a2f39b-1517-42ea-9259-aa9fc77a5db0.jpg","","","","Saudi Arabia's actions in the Arabian Peninsula reflect its desire to maintain political control over the region at any cost, but its new international relationships are mapping a new path toward a diversified economy.","","","arabian-might","1395","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > Saudi Arabia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do so, the Kingdom is drawing upon all its resources, leveraging its oil wealth, strong international relationships, and forward-thinking leadership to build a better future. It is a massive project, but the Middle East's wealthiest country is confident it has what it takes to succeed.</p><h4>RECENT SLOWDOWN</h4><p>Unsurprisingly, the world's largest oil exporter has seen its economy slow significantly as the price of oil has fallen in recent years. After reaching a high of 9.95% GDP growth in 2011, the Kingdom saw its growth rates fall to 3.63% in 2014 and 3.48% in 2015 as decreased oil revenues led to a series of compounding effects throughout its economy. Despite a slight recovery in the price of oil after OPEC production cuts, 2016 was even more difficult, with GDP growth falling to 1.4%, the lowest since the 1.82% posted during the middle of the worldwide economic recession in 2009. The World Bank projects growth to continue to slow in 2017, falling to 0.6% despite a 2.1% increase in the non-oil economy. Unsurprisingly, Saudi Arabia has also seen corresponding budget deficits in recent years due to the lack of revenue. After posting a record SAR367 billion (USD97.8 billion) deficit in 2015, the shortfall shrunk to SAR297 billion (USD79.2 billion) in 2016, below original projections of a SAR326 billion (USD86.9 billion) deficit. This came about thanks to aggressive cuts in government spending; after expenditures of USD260.8 billion in 2015, government spending fell 15% to USD220 billion in 2016. <br>The 2017 Saudi budget, however, reflects the government's confidence in the Kingdom's financial standing and a recognition that increased spending is needed to achieve its larger economic goals. The 2017 budget calls for USD237.9 billion in government expenditures, an 8% increase over 2016, with an expected deficit of USD52.8 billion. While still maintaining fiscal prudence, spending on infrastructure, education, and health and social services are all increasing significantly, with USD11.2 billion scheduled to go to meeting National Transformation Program goals. The Kingdom's long-term goal is to achieve a balanced budget by 2020 by raising energy prices and increasing its shares of non-oil related income, and performance through mid-2017 is on target to achieve that. The share of non-oil revenue, which is projected to be 31% of 2017 revenues, is expected to rise to 50% over that same timeframe.</p><h4>VISION 2030</h4><p>First announced in April 2016, Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is a wide-ranging blueprint for transforming the Kingdom's economy. It proposes a vision of the economy that takes oil not as its cornerstone but as a springboard from which Saudi Arabia can use its natural resources to become a hub for investment and commerce. One of the central goals of the plan is to increase the role of the private sector in the Saudi economy; the private sector currently constitutes less than 40% of the Kingdom's GDP, but the upcoming privatization of several key parts of the energy industry and the adaptation of new regulatory reforms should dramatically increase its role. The Vision Plan also calls for SMEs to become a larger part of the Kingdom's economy. Currently, SMEs make up less than 20% of Saudi Arabia's GDP and financial institutions provide only 5% of their funding. The Vision 2030 plan calls for the SME contribution to GDP to increase to 35% by 2030, thanks to a more robust entrepreneurial structure and the elimination of cumbersome regulations. The plan also calls for increased access to formal lines of credit with the goal of increasing the percentage of funding from financial institutions to 20% over the same time frame. At the same time, the Saudi government plans to launch incubators, venture capital funding centers, and training networks that draw upon the Kingdom's international relations to build the skills a young and rapidly growing population needs to increase entrepreneurship.</p><h4>SAUDI ARAMCO IPO &amp; THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT FUND</h4><p>The biggest privatization project currently underway, though, is the upcoming Saudi Aramco IPO, which is expected to be the largest public offering in history. The decision to sell a stake of Saudi Aramco, the Kingdom's oil and gas production company, has massive financial and economic implications; as the centerpiece of the government's privatization plan, the offering is in some ways expected to singlehandedly shift the balance in the Kingdom's investment portfolio. It would seem an impossible goal for almost any other company, but Saudi Aramco is large enough for this not to be a pipe dream. Originally American owned, the Saudi government purchased shares of the what was then the Arabian American Oil Company until it was formally transferred to the government and renamed Saudi Aramco in 1988. Today, it controls all upstream, midstream, and downstream oil operations in the country and has a production capacity of 12 million bpd, making it the world's largest oil producer and the cornerstone of the Saudi economy. It is no surprise, then, that the government's announcement that it would be selling a 5% stake got financial markets across the globe eager to learn more. Preliminary valuations of Saudi Aramco estimate its net worth at a staggering USD2 trillion, making a 5% stake worth about USD 100 billion—easily the largest IPO of all time.<br>The Saudi government plans to use the money earned from the IPO to turn its Public Investment Fund (PIF) into the largest in the world. Vision 2030 calls for half the money earned from Aramco's sale to be invested domestically, with the rest used to diversify the Kingdom's investments away from oil, ensuring a stable source of national income. Government officials have been careful to explain that their goal is not to compete with the private sector but instead to work with it by using the PIF to form new developmental pathways that strengthen both the position the country's domestic industries and its pool of international investments. By 2030, the goal is for the fund to be worth over SAR7 trillion (USD1.9 trillion). Long-term investment plans are already underway; in May 2017, PIF signed a deal with US investment group Blackstone, committing to invest USD20 billion in infrastructure spending, mostly in the US. It is an illustrative example of how the fund plans to slowly spread its reach worldwide; it uses Saudi Arabia's long-existing relationship with the US to open up a new area of investment away from the global energy industry.</p><p>Though the government's plans for the Saudi Aramco IPO and subsequent expansion of PIF are well structured, the sheer size of the undertaking has led to delays. Initially scheduled for early 2018, the Saudi Aramco IPO is now expected for to be held in late 2018 or early 2019. The primary factor behind the delay is the need for financial restructuring before Aramco can go public; Saudi leaders have had to make a number of decisions about how to structure the company in such a way to offer the best value to investors. One major hurdle was cleared in March 2017, when the government announced that it would reduce Saudi Aramco's tax rate from 85 to 50%, reducing investor fears that the structure of the company was too closely linked to the government. The cut in the tax rate also reflects the Saudi government's confidence that it is in a stable enough financial position to withstand the loss of some oil revenues even before PIF becomes a significant factor. Yet there are still investor concerns about the true valuation of the company and the role the Saudi government will play in making production decisions. Valuations have ranged from USD2 trillion (according to Prince Mohammed bin Salman) to USD1.4 trillion (according to private analysts), and the Saudi government has already announced that it will maintain control of all production decisions. This has raised the possibility of OPEC-led production cuts that could reduce investor gains. But even with all this, Saudi Aramco's unique potential still has investors salivating. Its IPO, whenever it comes, will be transformational.</p><h4>DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION</h4><p>Even with the privatization programs underway, the Saudi government is expected to be the most significant part of the Kingdom's economy for the near future, but government officials and industry leaders know that increasing personal consumption and the strength of the domestic private economy will be one of the key factors in the Kingdom's growth. As part of its austerity measures, the Saudi government eliminated bonuses for public sector employees and cut minister salaries by 20%. The move, which was part of the National Transformation Plan's mission to cut public sector wages from 45% of the budget to 40% by 2020, affected two-thirds of all working Saudi citizens. While part of a series of much-needed government cuts, the sudden and unexpected decrease in consumer purchasing ability had a significant impact on the larger Saudi economy. After oil prices rebounded in early 2017, the Saudi government announced the reversal of the cuts, announcing that the government was now in a more stable financial state and able to raise spending levels. The government also announced that banks would extend the generous lending policies they adapted immediately after the cut in order to increase private access to credit.

"2017-09-27T10:46:00.000Z","2017-09-27T10:46:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Getting In Line","<p>In December 2012, Mexico's three main political parties together signed the Pacto por México (Pact for Mexico), an unusual occasion of political unity that christened 95 initiatives of focus for newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto's government. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the National Action Party (PAN), and the Part of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) together inked the agreement. In January 2013, the Green Party signed onto the pact, too. One of the most important initiatives listed was that of education reform.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>Mexico's educational system consists of basic, secondary, and higher education, with basic education being compulsory for all children between the ages of six and 14. Preschool is both optional and free for children between three and five years of age.</p><p>Basic education is supplied by federal, state, and local governments as well as by private institutions. Some 93% of basic education is government funded, with the remaining 7% privately funded.</p><p>For each primary school student, Mexico spends 15% of its per capita GDP and, for each secondary school student, 17% of its per capita GDP. This spending is lower than the OECD average of 23% and 26%, respectively.<br>Increased enrollment has been particularly overwhelming in Mexico over the past few decades. Between 1950 and 2000, student enrollment in the formal education system in Mexico jumped from 3.25 million to 28.22 million. As of 2016, this number has reached 36.3 million, or nearly 30% of the country's population.<br>At the secondary school level, the gross enrollment rate has increased from 54% in 1991 to 90% in 2014. At the tertiary level, this rate increased from 15% in 1991 to 31.2% in 2016. However steep the rise in Mexico's education enrollment rates, the regional average is already far ahead, with tertiary level rates already at 46% in 2010.</p><h4>Poor Performance</h4><p>In 2012, 15-year old Mexico students scored 81 points below the OECD average in mathematics and less than 1% of Mexican students are top performers in mathematics, while this rate averaged 13% among OECD countries. The enrollment rate of 15 to 19 year olds in Mexico stands at 53%. Only Colombia and China experience lower rates of 43% and 34%, respectively. The OECD average is 84%. Mexico is the only OECD country where 15-19 year olds are expected to spend more time in employment (6.3 years) than in education (5.3 years), and more than 20% of 15-19 year olds are neither employed nor in school. Second to last among OECD countries, only 37% of Mexican adults have received secondary education, a rate that is just above Turkey's 34% and far below the OECD average of 75%.</p><p>Education hurdles lead to troubled outcomes in employment, with stark differences between men and women. Among those with below upper secondary education, only 44% of women are employed, compared to 88% of men. Some 56% of women with upper secondary education are employed, while 91% of men are employed with the same level of education. For those with tertiary education, 72% of women and 88% of men are employed. Ironically, Mexicans with higher levels of education completion are more susceptible to unemployment. In 2012, among 25-34 year olds with upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education attainment, 5.6% were unemployed. Meanwhile, 6.7% of tertiary-educated 25-34 year olds were unemployed. Only in Korea and Mexico was this same phenomenon unfolding, only with a more narrow difference.</p><h4>Strong Dissent Paralyses Reform</h4><p>In 2013, the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education (SEC) introduced a measure that would make 12 years of education compulsory throughout Mexico. However, the law did not kickoff fully due to infrastructure and overall capacity setbacks. SEC hopes compliance will become a reality in 2020, but full compliance is turning out to be an unrealistic expectation. So many rural areas lack the resources to achieve such a goal, and many of the government's attempts to transform the education sector are often met with aggressive opposition by the country's teacher's unions, the 1.4-million-strong Mexican Teachers Union (SNTE), and the 200,000-strong National Coordinating Committee (CNTE).</p><p>2013 is also when the newly elected president spearheaded the Pact for Mexico. The education reform the pact encompasses was bold and groundbreaking: it aimed to increase enrolment in secondary and tertiary education, provide financial and curricular autonomy to schools, and improve teacher quality and accountability at the primary and secondary levels. As far as improving teacher quality, the reform called to centralize the payment of teachers' salaries at the federal level and implement tests for the teachers to measure their competency every three years. The new law underlined new terms for hiring, job security, wages, and promotion. It also called for teaching jobs to be open to competition from any college graduate, regardless of the subject the graduate studied. Additionally, teachers were barred from passing their jobs on to family members or selling them on the market, a traditional practice that allows family members to inherit the role as teachers and promised jobs for life in spite of their academic performance.</p><p>The reaction among teachers unions to the pact was fierce and in June 2016, even fatal. In September 2014, protests held by teachers led to police and gang members in Iguala, Guerrero killing six people, wounding 25 and kidnapping 43 students from a local school. The CNTE responded with nationwide protests that nearly crippled the country, particularly in Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Michoacán.</p><h4>Teachers and their unions</h4><p>According to the OECD, of the total budget for primary, secondary, and post-secondary non-tertiary education, more than 92% goes to staff compensation and 83% to teachers' salaries. This is above the OECD average of 79% and 63%, respectively. More than 86% of spending on primary education goes to teachers' salaries, the highest proportion among all OECD countries, and 79% of secondary education spending goes to teachers' salaries, the third-highest proportion across OECD countries.</p><p>The OECD average student-to-teacher ratio is 15:1 among primary schools and 13:1 among secondary schools. Mexico's ratio are at 28:1 and 30:1, respectively. While teachers' unions have a history of being strong political and social forces in Mexico, their staunch opposition to governmental reforms may be hurting students more than helping them. Formerly, government officials have avoided reforms to avert confrontation with teachers unions, which are not only popular but also ridden with union officials who exercise political and financial power. For Mexican students to perform at levels comparable to their OECD counterparts and later contribute successfully to a modern economy, reforms are necessary, even if they are not necessarily welcome. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Education","getting-in-line","1214","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-22T13:37:00.000Z","2017-09-22T13:37:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Nuts & Bolts","<p>The purpose of this article is to provide a general summary of certain aspects of Mexican law that may be of interest to foreign companies considering doing business in Mexico.</p><p>The political structure of Mexico is a federal republic that comprises 32 federal entities. The federal government is composed of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Each of the 32 federal entities has its own constitution, civil code, and other local laws and regulations, as well as its own executive, legislative, and judicial authorities. Mexico has a civil law system that is based on Roman law and Napoleonic principles. Thus, our basic legal principles are largely codified in civil, commercial, criminal, and procedural codes. <br>Regulation of foreign investment<br>The Foreign Investment Law (FIL) and its regulations define “foreign investment“ as:<br>• Participation by foreign investors (defined in turn as an individual or entity of any nationality other than Mexican, and foreign entities with no legal standing)—in any percentage—in the capital stock of Mexican companies;<br>• Investments by Mexican companies in which foreign capital has a majority interest; or<br>• Participation by foreign investors in activities and acts contemplated in the FIL.<br>As a general rule, the FIL allows foreign investors and Mexican companies to be controlled by foreign investors without prior authority approval. In compliance with the Mexican Constitution, the FIL reserves certain strategic areas to the Mexican state. Neither Mexican nor foreign investors may engage in these areas of economic activity, with some specific exceptions and requirements in some cases. These areas include: (i) exploration and extraction of petroleum and other hydrocarbons; (ii) planning and control of the national electricity system as well as the public service of transmission and distribution of electricity; (iii) nuclear energy generation; (iv) radioactive minerals; (v) telegraphs; (vi) radio telegraphy; (vii) mail service; (viii) issuance of money; (ix) control, supervision, and security of ports, airports, and heliports; and (x) certain others expressly indicated under the corresponding legislation.<br>Under the FIL, a foreign company must obtain approval from the Ministry of Economy to establish and register a branch or a representative office in Mexico. However, the aforementioned regulations are not applicable for foreign companies from the US, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Uruguay, Japan, and Peru. Indeed, such entities only have to file a notice declaring certain information of the company, such as the corporate purpose, main activity, and domicile. After the company files such notice, it can be registered with the Public Registry of Property and Commerce. Notwithstanding the latter, any foreign individual or company may incorporate a company under Mexican law and jurisdiction. <br>Under the FIL, all foreign investments, whether subject to prior approval or not, must be registered with the Foreign Investment Registry within 40 business days from the date of the respective incorporation, branch registration, acquisition, or execution of the relevant trust agreement. Foreign investors that do not register their investment with the Foreign Investment Registry are subject to administrative fines.<br>Forms of business organizations for Mexican incorporated companies.<br>The Mexican General Law of Commercial Companies (MGLCC) regulates various forms of business organization. The MGLCC regulates not only the requirements for their incorporation, but also sets forth their corporate governance directives. Relevant and commonly used forms of business organizations regulated in the MGLCC include the following:<br>a) Corporations (“S.A.“ or Sociedad Anónima de Capital Variable or “S.A. de C.V.“; hereinafter collectively referred to as “corporation(s)“).<br>b) Limited liability companies (Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada or “S. de R. L.“ or Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada de Capital Variable or “S. de R. L. de C.V.“).<br>c) Partnerships (Sociedades de Nombre Colectivo or Sociedad de Nombre Colectivo de Capital Variable).<br>Foreign investors do not commonly use partnerships as their investment vehicles in Mexico due to the fact that such investment vehicles do not provide limitation of liability to its partners. US investors frequently incorporate limited liability companies because this form of business organization does provide limited liability to its partners and because it provides certain benefits for US tax purposes (as they are considered pass-through entities). Corporations, however, are by far the most common form of business organization used in Mexico.<br>Tax treaties<br>Mexico has executed treaties for the avoidance of double taxation with various countries, more than 40 countries, including the US, Canada, and most OECD countries. Those treaties establish different rules for taxation of permanent establishments and of Mexican-source income (e.g., withholding rates on dividends, royalties, and interest) derived by residents of the signatory countries. The relevant tax treaty must be reviewed to determine the applicable rates. Absent such a treaty, the rules of the Mexican Income Tax Law (ITL) will govern (Income tax for Companies, without considering deductions, is a rate of 30%).<br>Individuals and legal entities are subject to the payment of Income Tax when: i) they are Tax Residents of Mexico with respect to their worldwide net income (that is, gross income minus allowable deductions); ii) they are foreign tax residents with a permanent establishment (tax presence) in Mexico, with respect to the income attributable to such permanent establishment; and iii) they are foreign tax residents with a Mexican source of income when they do not have a permanent establishment in Mexico, or if such income is not attributable to a permanent establishment.<br>Mexico imposes a value-added tax on the following activities: sale of goods, lease of goods, rendering of services, and importation of goods or services. The general rate is 16% of the value of the subject matter transaction. A 0% rate applies in certain limited cases, mainly related to the exportation of goods and services, as well as food and medicines. <br>Generally, Mexico is a country willing to accept foreign investment, a procedure that although can be considered a formal endeavor, has basic requirements for incorporating and operating in the country. œ–</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legal","the-nuts-bolts-mexico-2017","1200","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-22T13:33:00.000Z","2017-09-22T13:33:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","In Flux","<p>Despite moving down two places from 45th to 47th in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business ranking, Mexico slightly improved ease of doing business in terms of distance to the frontrunner. The most notable improvement was in the sub-ranking for registering property due to increased reliability of infrastructure. Mexico remained steady in most subcategories and kept its fifth-place ranking for getting credit. Mexico's overall ranking places it first within the Latin America and Caribbean region, ahead of Colombia and Peru in second and third, respectively. GDP growth was slightly down in 2016 compared 2015, dropping from 2.5% to 2.3% according to the World Bank. The Mexican peso is rebounding to pre-Trump election levels, and confidence is on the up. Even with several regional free trade agreements in limbo, it seems the Mexican economy has a stable footing in these tumultuous times.</p><p>NAFTA<br>With the election of President Trump in November 2016 came fears in Mexico of NAFTA renegotiations and an overall economic downward spiral. Mexico's worst fears have yet to be realized, but the country is still braced for the economic impact of Trump's agenda. Mexico's macroeconomic stability in recent years has been driven by both clear objectives of the Mexican government and further economic integration within North America. This economic integration supports a long-term perspective of Mexican-US relations based on cooperation and contradicts Trump's political rhetoric. And so far, the US President's rhetoric has not led to any concrete action, indicating that decades of furthering economic ties will not be unwound by a few words from an inexperienced politician. Businesses, especially along Mexico's northern border, have increasingly integrated operations and supply chains across the North American region.<br>In August 2017, Mexico, the US, and Canada met in Washington for NAFTA renegotiations. Mexico is looking to incorporate new sectors into an updated NAFTA. Amongst Mexico's objectives is a call to include energy, financial services, and telecommunications—sectors that have been privatized since the original deal in 1994—in the updated deal. Mexico will oppose additional tariffs.<br>Regardless of what happens with NAFTA, businesses are still exploring economic relations with other countries and regions to make up for the economic slowdown related to political uncertainty. Depreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar in 2016 has led to a decrease in imports and the need to expand exports. Slowly but surely, foreign investment in Mexico too is diversifying. Increased FDI from China and other Asian countries gives Mexico some leverage going into NAFTA negotiations. Though the US still accounts for roughly half of FDI, other sources include Spain, Germany, Canada, and Japan. Furthermore, FDI increased 0.6% in 1Q2017 compared to the same period in 2016, reaching USD7.95 billion.<br>Trans-Pacific Partnership<br>Trump's presidency has also influenced another regional trade agreement that includes Mexico. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was one of former US President Obama's key achievements and promoted economic relations amongst 12 Pacific Rim countries. Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in January 2017, the remaining 11 original signatories have been working to finalize a new framework by November 2017. Aligned with Mexico's interest to expand exports and reduce dependency on US economic ties, the TPP would provide greater access to economies such as Japan and Australia. With a huge agricultural sector and no competition from the US or EU within the new TPP-11, Mexico could be poised to become a major supplier for food-importing countries such as Japan and Vietnam. If successfully renegotiated, the TPP would liberalize markets and lower both non-tariff and tariff barriers to trade between Mexico, Chile, Peru, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Singapore, and Japan. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","doıng busıness","in-flux","1244","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-22T13:21:00.000Z","2017-09-22T13:21:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Up in the Air","<h4>A new Air Transport Agreement</h4><p>between Mexico and the US went into effect in the second half of 2016. Secretary of Communications and Transport, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, and former US Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, signed a deal that will remove restrictions on commercial air travel between both countries. The agreement has Mexico's tourism sector scrambling to prepare for more visitors than ever before.</p><p>The new agreement will usher in a whole new era of air travel between the two neighbors. Before the measures went into effect, only three airlines from each country were allowed to service any given US-Mexico route. Many airlines were shut out of markets, resulting in local oligopolies for a lucky few that naturally inflated prices. Now that these restrictions have been tossed out, unlimited market access is allowed to almost all cities in both countries, which translates directly into cheaper flights and a boost in new visitors from increased competition.</p><p>While this noticeably excludes Mexico City, it is still phenomenal news for a Mexican tourism sector that has been growing rapidly in recent years. In the first half of 2016, Mexico received 47 million international visitors, 17 million of which were tourists, an 8.6% increase on the year before. Cancún International Airport received the most foreign visitors in 2015, some 3.7 million passengers, even more than Mexico City. From Cancún, travelers can access popular destinations such as Cozumel, Riviera Maya, Playa del Carmen, and much of the Yucatan. Even more significant is the fact that 60% of Mexico's vacationers are from the US. With surging demand and plummeting ticket prices, the sector's growth has a bright future indeed. American, Delta, Southwest, Interjet, and Frontier have been among the first to announce dozens of new routes, most noticeably to service the huge Cancún market. But many airlines are adding new routes all over the country, including other popular resort towns such as Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos. Most of these are slated to begin in December, just in time for a Christmas vacation on the beach. This news comes after Secretary of Tourism, Enrique de la Madrid Cordero, announced that US tourist arrivals by air had already increased 22.6% in 1Q2016 compared with 1Q2015.</p><p>The implications for the broader Mexican economy are huge. In 2015, the tourism sector accounted for 6.8% of GDP, some USD79.7 billion, making Mexico's the seventh largest tourism economy in the world. More telling are the employment numbers attributed to the sector. In 2015, 3.8 million jobs—7.5% of total employment—were directly related to the industry. That is not to mention the employment indirectly supported by tourism, from construction and marketing to restaurants and cleaning services. Were these included, that number would stretch to 8 million jobs, or 15.9% of total employment. Moreover, the World Travel and Tourism Council predicts that tourism will create another 2 million in Mexico in the next decade alone.</p><p>The easing of restrictions will also allow Mexicans to travel more affordably to the US. And since the agreement also applies to cargo airlines, new supply chain hubs are expected to spring up all across Mexico. These new measures exemplify the movement away from protectionist policies and towards the integration of the Mexican and American economies. The enhanced freedom of movement will mean a greater influx of people coming into Mexico, not to mention the savings from reduced airline fairs that will find its way into many different sectors of the Mexican economy. Now that the skies are unrestricted, Mexico will be able to flaunt its beauty as never before.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TRANSPORT AGREEMENt","up-in-the-air","1284","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mexico is the American land of tourism opportunity. Classic destinations such as Riviera Maya, Mexico City, and Acapulco are beloved favorites; simultaneously, new locations are constantly unveiled as up-and-coming destinations and are helping to diversify Mexican tourism. Its combination of enchanting beaches, natural wonders, historic and cultural riches, and local flavors sets it apart from regional competitors in Latin and North America. To little surprise, the tourism industry is still growing and complementing Mexico's overall economic growth.</p><p>According to data from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the tourism industry directly contributed MXN1.4 trillion (USD76.7 billion) to the Mexican economy, or 7.4% of total GDP, in 2016. Tourism's total contribution to GDP, including direct, indirect, and induced contribution, was MXN3.1 trillion (USD165.9 billion) in 2016, representing 16% of GDP. WTTC forecasts tourism's direct and total contributions to GDP will increase in 2017 by 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively. Tourism's total contribution is expected to increase 3% per annum to MXN4.3 trillion (USD232.1 billion), 17.2% of GDP, in 2027. Mexico ranked tenth out of 185 countries in terms of the absolute size of tourism's total contribution to GDP in 2016. The expected growth in tourism's contribution to Mexican GDP in 2017 is higher than the anticipated growth in both the US and Canada.<br>Mexico's tourism sector is particularly significant for the job market. In 2016, tourism directly supported some 4 million jobs, 7.9% of total employment. WTTC estimates this figure will rise by 2.6% in 2017 and 1.8% per annum to almost five million jobs in 2027, accounting for 8.5% of employment.</p><p>Broadening the scope to tourism's direct, indirect, and induced contribution to employment, Mexico claimed the fourth spot in WTTC's 2016 country rankings. Tourism directly or indirectly supported over 8.6 million jobs, some 16.8% of employment. WTTC predicts this number will rise 2% per annum to over 10.6 million jobs in 2027, totaling 18.1% of employment.</p><p>The World Bank recorded a 9.3% increase in international tourism's total number of arrivals from 29.3 million in 2014 to 32.1 million in 2015, and data show international tourism expenditures in 2015 made up nearly 3% of total imports. In 2017, WTTC expects Mexico to welcome some 37.8 international tourist arrivals, who are expected to spend approximately MXN411.1 billion (USD22 billion). Visitor exports are projected to increase 4.5% per annum between 2017 and 2027, reaching MXN638.6 billion (USD34.2 billion) in 2027.</p><p>A quick breakdown of tourism's contribution to GDP shows the contribution is mostly from domestic, leisure travelers. Tourists' spending in 2016 was largely comprised of leisure spending, totaling 88.7% of tourism's contribution to GDP, as opposed to the 11.3% from business spending. Domestic spending also far outweighed foreign visitor spending. Spending from domestic tourism represented 83.9% of tourism's total contribution to GDP, and spending from foreign visitors represented 16.1%.</p><p>While spending by domestic travelers represents a larger portion of tourism's contribution to GDP, non-border tourism—tourism sourced from countries that do not share a border with Mexico—reached 18.4 million people in 2015, increasing 46.4% since 2005 at a rate of 3.9% growth per annum. Non-border tourists represent a higher value market because they spend more and stay longer. Data from the OECD Study on Tourism show four out of the top-five source markets for international arrivals are non-border countries and include Canada, the UK, Colombia, and Argentina. Additionally, several US airlines are increasing their service to Mexico following the elimination of restrictions on the number of flights between the two countries in August 2016.<br>WTTC predicts large increases in tourism investment, indicating the accelerating growth potential of tourism in Mexico. Tourism investment in 2016 was MXN143.4 billion (USD7.7billion), 3.3% of total investment. Predictions from WTTC show a 5.6% increase in investment in 2017 and a growth rate of 5.9% per annum over the next 10 years. The National Infrastructure Plan 2014-2018 includes a MXN181.2 billion (USD9.7 billion) portfolio of tourism-related infrastructure projects, with more than half of investment coming from the private sector.<br>Peak tourism season typically begins in mid-December and continues through mid-April. Tourism revenues and tourist arrivals peaked in December 2016, according to Trading Economics. Tourist arrivals peaked at 2.49 million corresponding to USD2.12 billion in tourism revenue.</p><h4>Sunset of Sun-Sea-Sand Era</h4><p>Combining these statistics with the fact that the World Tourism Organization (WTO) ranks Mexico as the seventh major tourist destination in the world, it is hard to imagine any sort of decline in Mexico's tourism. Its strength is built on the development of large-scale resort tourism on its coasts. However, a study on tourism by the OECD prioritizes a shift in Mexico's long-term strategy from the sun-sea-sand model, common to Latin American countries in previous decades and focused on resort-based tourism, toward a more diversified, sustainable tourism model.</p><p>Known for its dazzling beaches, Mexico's natural treasures also include mountains, rainforests, deserts, coral reefs, and archaeological sites. Future growth will depend on Mexico's ability to develop and diversify its offerings to visitors sustainably. Despite an overall reduction in public expenditure on the sector's development in 2016, over one-fifth of public expenditures went to regional and sustainable tourism development in 2016.<br>Not only is Mexico expanding its offerings; the country is also developing its tourism investment models. Diversifying its offerings will facilitate and benefit from the development of FDI. Mexico is also looking at public-private partnerships at the sub-national level to develop tourism-related infrastructure projects through the Program for the Promotion of Public-Private Partnerships in Mexican States (PIAMPPEM), an initiative of the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank.</p><h4>Not Just Tourism</h4><p>As its tourism industry continues to thrive, Mexico is looking to align tourism, and its success, with other industries such as transportation, hoping to use tourism as a driver of economic prosperity. The National Development Plan 2013-2018 highlights tourism as one of six priority sectors through which the government plans to capture economic potential. In the OECD's Study on Tourism in Mexico, boosting connectivity and mobility of visitors as well as supporting market diversification are noted as key strategies for developing Mexico's tourism. This strategy includes continuing to liberalize air service agreements, increase connectivity of airports, and improve road transport.</p><p>The opening of Mexico City's new international airport in 2020 is expected to boost both tourism—most especially international tourism between Mexico and Asia—and transportation. Expanding air traffic capacity and replacing Mexico City's current international airport, the new airport will serve up to 120 million passengers per year when all six runways are opened. According to government data, the national airline fleet has grown 41% and 789 routes have opened since 2012. Mexico has also modernized and expanded 28 airports. With a new Center for Innovation and Space Development, Mexico is the third-top destination for aerospace project FDI. In alignment with its tourism development, Mexico is positioning itself as a leader in the aerospace industry. The focus on air transport comes as cruise tourism has declined 8.8% between 2005 and 2015, according to data from the OECD Study on Tourism.</p><h4>Popular Destinations</h4><p>Riviera Maya and Mexico City are the country's top destinations, according to OECD data on arrivals at hotels. Riviera Maya is located on the coast of the Caribbean Sea on the Yucatan Peninsula and is home to both large, all-inclusive resorts, and small boutique hotels along the white-sand beaches. Its turquoise coasts are home to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second longest barrier reef system in the world, and boast some of the world's best aquatic activities. Visitors looking for activities a little further inland are attracted to popular archaeological sites such as Chichen Itza and Coba. Ecoparks, natural water theme parks, also include smaller archaeological ruins in addition to flora, fauna, adventure activities, and exhibitions. Riviera Maya and its ecoparks are easily accessible through the recently modernized Cancún airport.</p><p>Mexico City, in addition to being a financial center of the Americas, is an incredibly popular tourist destination in the high plateaus of Valle de México. The historic center of the city and the floating gardens of Xochimilco are UNESCO World Heritage sites. The metropolis hosts hundreds of museums, art galleries, and concert halls, which draw cultural events year round. Mexico City offers a full range of eating, shopping, and exploring for all types of travelers. Just outside the city, the ruins of Teotihuacan are home to some of the largest ancient pyramids in the world.</p><p>Also noteworthy is Tijuana's transformation as a destination for great food. According to the 2017 New York Times annual list of 52 places to visit, Tijuana cracked the top ten for its culinary renaissance, luxury condo surge, and USD60 million investment in a bus rapid transit system. With support from the Mexican federal government, the transportation project will connect residents and visitors to the downtown district, burgeoning with breweries, coffee shops, and diverse culinary options ranging from high-end restaurants to food trucks.</p><p>Tourists are no strangers to Oaxaca, but the coastal town of Puerto Escondido is drawing people from the popular capital, Oaxaca City. Puerto Escondido translates to “hidden port“ and attracts mostly surfers, backpackers, and Mexican families. Bars, hotels, cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs parallel the beach and line the town's promenade, Perez Gazga Avenue. Here visitors can find handmade Oaxacan souvenirs such as traditional blouses, tapestries, bags, hammocks, and jewelry. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/cf9da36d-e9e5-4cf1-afe0-4624846df7fb.jpg","","","","","","","land-of-opportunity","1520","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a booming sector with an annual growth of 15%, in contrast to the pharmaceutical industry, which has grown by 4% on average in the last 10 years. Currently, the medical device industry employs about 132,880 people in the country, 7.7% more than in 2015. By the end of 2016, medical device production amounted to USD15 billion, of which USD8.2 billion came from exports.</p><p>Factors such as a highly skilled workforce, access to the one of the world's largest consumer markets for medical devices, and competitive wages make Mexico's medical device manufacturing sector a key player, and these elements will continue to foster growth in the industry<br>When the NAFTA entered into force, the agreement helped transform Mexico's border factories, known as maquiladoras, into epicenters of industry—most notably in Tijuana. Manufacturers of medical devices and equipment in Tijuana began attracting skilled Mexican workers such as engineers and technicians. Because of NAFTA, Mexican manufacturers enjoy essentially tax-free raw materials supplied from the US and, in turn, supply the US with lower cost, life-saving medical devices and equipment. But recent political tensions and looming potential changes to legislation may knock trade within this sector out of equilibrium.<br>Despite the impending revision of NAFTA, which will stipulate new conditions and restrictions for exports to the US, expectations for 2017 are high. The sector is expected to close the year with a total production of USD17.7 billion. The country produces medical equipment, prostheses and functional aids, diagnostic agents, supplies for dental use, surgical and healing materials, as well as hygiene products.<br>According to ProMéxico, purchases of medical devices by the public sector have been one of the largest drivers of growth in the sector. In the last decade, the medical devices sector in Mexico has shown dynamic and sustained growth, based on the development of manufacturing capacities by the main companies in the sector, which have found in the country a key partner for their investment and business strategies. The industry is mainly made up of SMEs with great potential for development, as there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of more advanced equipment and a higher level of technology.<br>Regarding the geographic distribution of the industry in Mexico, three important regions for the innovation and development of medical devices stand out. In the northern areas of Baja California and Nuevo León hosts one of the most important groups of medical device manufacturing in Latin America; also Jalisco, in the western area, and the center with the Federal District, State of Mexico, Morelos, and Puebla include important players in the sector. Of these areas, Baja California is the most important cluster in the country because companies in this state make 33% of total exports from the sector.<br>Regarding the key strengths of the sector that will help it face the new scenario presented by the new US government, the latest report by KPMG assures that Mexico offers 18.9% savings in manufacturing costs for the industry of medical devices and 7.8% savings in manufacturing costs of precision components, compared to the US. Mexico's location is also key—allowing savings in logistics, facilitating the inspection of plants by the health authorities, and responding quickly to sudden changes.<br> Growth for this industry is expected to continue over the next few years, and by 2020, the production of medical devices will reach a total of USD25.6 million with an average annual growth rate of 6.4%, which is higher than in the NAFTA region (5.1%) and countries such as Germany (4.3%), Japan (4.4%), and Switzerland (2.5%). œ–</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Medical Device Manufacturing","americas-lifeline","1291","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-22T10:58:00.000Z","2017-09-22T10:58:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Growing Strong","<p>Agriculture is an important piece of Mexico's economic portfolio, accounting for more than 3.5% of GDP and nearly 13.5% of the labor force. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Mexico has almost 2.7 million hectares set aside for permanent crop production and almost 23 million ha of arable land. The US is Mexico's most important trade partner in terms of agriculture, and nearly 80% of Mexico's exports are destined for the US, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). In 2015 alone, Mexico exported more than USD21.9 billion worth of goods to the US. With the establishment of NAFTA, agricultural trade between Mexico and the US has exploded, and Mexico's agricultural exports have grown by double digits every year, according to the USDA.</p><h4>Grains and Corn</h4><p>Mexico is a large grain producer, but its production capacity is below national demand, making it a net importer of grain, much of which comes from the US. According to the International Grains Council (IGC), Mexico's grain production for 2016-2017 will reach 35.1 millions tons, up nearly 1 million tons from the previous year's figures. Wheat production is forecast to reach around 4 million tons, up by more than 5% from the previous year, and corn production is set to hit 23.5 million tons, or slightly lower than the previous year. Additionally, sorghum production is forecast to hit 6.8 million tons, growing by nearly 20% over 2015-2016, and durum wheat production is expected to surpass 2.5 million tons.</p><p>A number of factors have the potential to undercut agricultural productivity in Mexico in the coming year. The uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming El Niño weather pattern has caused forecasters to lower their expectations for a number of crops. According to the USDA, the large variability in technological advancement across the nation's agricultural sector also has a major impact on yields in Mexico, with those in advanced agricultural areas like Sinaloa achieving figures comparable to those in the US. Small-scale growers, however, still utilize outdated and sometimes inefficient techniques. A lack of training, knowledge, and poor organization often have a negative impact on productivity as well.</p><p>According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), maize is the single-most important staple crop for Mexicans, and it is most often consumed in the form of tortillas or corn. Corn in these forms represents nearly 8.3% of total food expenditure for the average Mexican household. As domestic production increases, prices for corn may fall in the short term, but in the long term Mexican farmers will need to focus on and leverage economies of scale to prop up yields.</p><h4>Livestock</h4><p>According to the latest Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN) report from the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service, Mexican cattle numbers are expected to increase in the coming year. Government programs aimed at creating financial incentives for herd repopulation, programs aimed at improving the genetic composition of the domestic Mexican herds, and stable grain prices are all expected to have serious positive impacts on the strength and size of the cattle industry in Mexico. Coupled with this rise in cattle production will be a rise in exports. According to the USDA, Mexican cattle herds are expected to reach 7.1 million in 2017. Exports to other markets, particularly the US, remain strong, but cattle recovery in foreign markets has the potential to slow growth. In order to improve herd genetics, Mexican livestock firms are expected to continue importing American and Australian cattle.</p><p>Production for beef and veal is forecast to reach 1.9 million tons in 2017, a bit more than production levels in 2016, which reached 1.87 million tons. Consumption is forecast hit 1.79 million tons in 2017. Additionally, imports are expected to reach 182,000 tons in 2017, most of which will come from the US. Exports are forecast at 290,000 tons, with the US as the primary market, followed by Japan, Hong Kong, and Canada.<br>Pig droves have been impacted by the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), but efforts aimed at improving herd genetics are expected to reduce the severity of the outbreak. This, in turn, is expected to bolster production, bringing down pork prices and improving consumption. Mexican pig droves are expected to reach 19.3 million head in 2017, and commodity pork production is expected to grow 4.5%, reaching 1.44 million tons. Consumption is also expected to grow, expanding by almost 3% to 2.27 million tons or 19kg per capita. Imports are forecast to hit 1 million tons, or 2% higher than 2016, most of which is sourced from the U.S. Exports are expected to reach 170,000 tons, with Japan being the country's largest export market.</p><h4>Blue Agave and Tequila</h4><p>The agriculture industry in Mexico has many faces, and a prominent one is tequila. Agave, the most important ingredient in tequila, is an important component of Mexico's agricultural and cultural landscape. With tequila more popular than ever before, producers hope agave production will increase. There are, however, signs that agave production may be in the midst of an industry-wide decline. The time it takes to cultivate agave and falling prices for the crop has catalyzed a shift among some farmers, and they are switching from the slow-growing agave to cash crops with a faster turnover like corn and beans. This shift has some fearing that agave supplies will fall well below demand, leading to higher prices for end-consumers of tequila. Leaders in the tequila industry are trying to ensure that farmers are able to both maintain their traditional methods of farming and increase the level of agave supplies, and they are confident that their efforts will strengthen the industry and ensure it remains sustainable and profitable. </p><h4>Coffee</h4><p>Coffee is an important component in Mexico's agricultural basket, and production has been growing in recent years. According to the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, Mexican coffee producers are expected to produce 3.5 million 60kg bags in 2016/2017 and 3.8 million in 2017/2018. Large-scale replanting efforts and optimal growth conditions have had a positive impact on production figures in recent months, and these improvements are expected to persist. Conversely, coffee imports are expected to fall as domestic supply meets domestic demand.</p><h4>Sugar</h4><p>According to the USDA's most recent GAIN Report, Mexican sugar production for the marketing year 2017/18 is forecast to reach 6.6 million metric tons of raw-value, while 2016-2017 numbers are expected to hit 6.5 million tons. Officials expect weather patterns to be highly conducive to high production yields, and the number of hectares cultivated will remain stable at around 824,000. With approximately 51 sugar mills in operation across the country, the industry is an important source of employment, both direct and indirect, for Mexicans in the agricultural space. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/d1581709-16e7-47a3-a0f0-4444e03c7c51.jpg","","","","","","","growing-strong-mexico-2017","1286","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That is, 52.6 million people had gained medical insurance in under a decade. Back in 2004, approximately half of Mexico's 110-million population had no medical insurance. At the time, medical insurance came with employment. This led lawmakers to push for the publically funded Seguro Popular program.</p><p>The goal of Seguro Popular was to provide even the poorest of Mexicans with access to preventative healthcare services—vaccinations and screenings—as well as medical treatment for diseases. By 2012, the country had achieved its goal: universal healthcare coverage.</p><p>This achievement, however, cannot shroud the continuing disparities present in healthcare quality as well as the challenges faced by those living in rural areas to effectively and efficiently access treatment.</p><h4>MEDIUM STRIDES, MAJOR CHALLENGES</h4><p>In tandem with the introduction of the Seguro Popular program, public investment in healthcare rose from 2.4% to 3.2% of GDP between 2003 and 2013. Other parameters, such as infant and maternal mortality and heart attack and stroke deaths, have improved and life expectancy has risen to just below 75 years. Infant mortality dropped 38% since 2000 to 13 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013.</p><p>While improvements in certain areas have been measured, they are relatively weak in consideration of the performance of other OECD nations. Between 2000 and 2013, the average life expectancy across OECD nations rose from 77.1 to 80.4 years, while Mexico's increased only 1.3 years, from 73.3 to 74.6 years. Death from heart disease only decreased by 1% since 1990, compared to the OECD average of 48%. Deaths from strokes fell by 38% since 1990, compared to the OECD average of 54%.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mexico's obesity rates have increased significantly from 2000 to 2012—63.3% to 71.3% of the adult population. Diabetes now affects 15.9% of adults, which is substantial compared to the average of 6.9% among OECD nations.</p><p>Other healthcare hurdles include administrative and structural infrastructure. Administrative costs account for 8.9% of Mexico's total health expenditure, making it not only the highest recorded in the OECD but also virtually unchanged over the past decade. Also, the highest rate among OECD countries is Mexico's out-of-pocket spending, which makes up 45% of total health spending and 4% of total household expenditure.</p><h4>HEALTHCARE STRUCTURE</h4><p>Aside from Seguro Popular, the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) offers regular healthcare insurance for employees. Depending on the salary, one pays a monthly premium, as does the employer and state. The IMSS runs its own hospitals and primary care clinics. The Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE) offers similar social security for federal government employees.</p><p>Then, there is private healthcare, which generally encompasses the highest quality of healthcare available in Mexico and is mostly reserved for foreigners and upper- or middle-class Mexicans. According to Global Health Intelligence, there are nearly 3,000 private hospitals, which make up two-thirds of all hospitals in Mexico. However, only 10% of the Mexican population is covered by private insurance, for which they pay mostly out of pocket. There are currently 11.4 public and 28.6 for-profit, privately owned hospitals per one million people. This denotes the largest disparity between private-to-public-sector facilities among OECD countries.</p><h4>MEDICAL DEVICES</h4><p>The rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases is pushing Mexico to develop its medical infrastructure. While the life expectancy in Mexico is 75 years, three-fifths of all deaths take place before then due to non-communicable diseases. Diabetes is the leading cause of death in Mexico, followed by ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease.<br>By 2020, Mexico's medical device market is expected to reach a value of USD6.5 billion, a significant increase from its 2015 value of USD4.9 billion. The US leads the pack, exporting more medical devices to Mexico than any other country. Brazil, China, Canada, France, and Germany follow behind.

"2017-09-22T10:23:00.000Z","2017-09-22T10:23:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","On the Up and Up","<p>Despite being one of the largest cities in the world and the largest in Latin America, Mexico City has never been famous for its skyscrapers in the same way that New York, Dubai, or Hong Kong has. For most of its recent history, companies looking for AAA+ corporate office preferred to move west into newer zones bordering Mexico State where they had more space to build 'campus-style' offices. However, as the population swells and traffic increases, many major companies have returned to the city center, prompting a boom in vertical construction in areas like Paseo de la Reforma, Insurgentes, and Santa Fe.</p><p>Torre Latinoamericana, built in 1956 near the city's historic center, was Mexico's first skyscraper. At the time of its construction, it was the tallest building in Latin America and remained Mexico's tallest building until 1972, when it was surpassed by Hotel de México, which was later topped by Torre de Pemex in 1982. The earthquake of 1985 put a halt to further skyscraper construction until the turn of the millennium. Since then, new skyscraper projects have become taller and more frequent. In 2015, Torre BBVA Bancomer became the tallest building in Mexico, only to have its title stolen by Torre Reforma a year later, which is currently the tallest building in the city measuring 246m. Over the next three years, another seven skyscrapers are in the works, the tallest of which, Puerta Reforma, will measure 335m and be completed in 2020.</p><p>TBY spoke with Antonio Caliz, Country Manager of international architecture firm Gensler, about the growing popularity of vertical construction in Mexico City. Caliz told TBY, “On Reforma and Insurgentes streets in Mexico City, we are starting to see buildings over 50 stories, which is unprecedented. There are opportunities and challenges to this. In a city of 20 million people, the value of land has grown exponentially, especially in the financial districts, and developers always seek a great balance between investments and returns.“<br>Mexico's skyscraper growth has been part of a more general trend towards vertical development in all segments in the city, not just iconic projects in the city's business districts. As Alfredo Elí­as Ayub, Director General of Promociones Metrópolis, told TBY, two main trends have been behind the growth of vertical construction: the increasing price of land and the increasing role of millennials in the real estate sector, who have different lifestyle preferences than previous generations. “For large cities, land has started to become scarcer and the price of land to build a house has increased; projects have to be vertical. Another key trend is that people want to be much closer to their jobs. They are willing to sacrifice two things: the need for a house and size,“ Ayub told TBY.</p><p>As José Shalot of Quiero Casa also explained to TBY, the trend toward vertical development in more central areas of the city can also have social and environmental benefits. According to Shalot, the focus on horizontal sprawl in the past has meant that “[low-income] families end up living in commuter towns where the quality of life and public services such as schools are below average. Everything becomes more expensive for the government and families, and the families remain poor. We need to bring the families closer to where they work, as this is also better for the environment: we have done studies with researchers and found that the families living in the apartments we build emit half the levels of CO2 compared to those in the outskirts of the cities.“</p><p>Another factor has been increased economic stability, which allows for the kind of long-term planning that is necessary to build bigger real estate projects. It seems the measure of Mexico City's economic well-being is best captured in meters or, more specifically, in the heights of its skyscrapers. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","on-the-up-and-up","1244","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-22T10:05:00.000Z","2017-09-22T10:05:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Horn of Plenty","<p>Mexico's agricultural sector, often the main source of tensions with the country's largest trade partner, is inextricably linked with Mexico's economic health as a whole, accounting for USD23 billion in 2016 in exports to the US. Despite its prominence, Mexico's agricultural industry has faced challenges in recent years stemming from a combination of domestic and international issues.</p><p>Though mostly arid and sparse with extremely high summer temperatures, Sonora and Baja California are a couple of the most important agricultural regions in the country, producing massive amounts of wheat, potatoes, grapes, watermelons, and more. Wide-scale irrigation projects are to thank for the agricultural sector in the northwest. In the early 20th century, the government began to construct massive irrigation systems that utilized dams and reservoirs to bring water to the valleys in these states. These sweeping public works projects allowed for the introduction of large-scale farming of non-native crops. </p><p>Further contributing to the agricultural development of the region was the invention of new agricultural techniques that increased crop yields, a process termed the Green Revolution. Mexico was then at the epicenter of the research, and the first strains of high-yield wheat were grown by crop researchers in Sonora. Once improved agricultural techniques and complex comprehensive irrigation systems were fully integrated into the northwest's agricultural sector, the area became one of the world's largest agricultural hotspots. Today, approximately one-quarter of Mexico's 20 million ha of cultivated land is irrigated. Sonora and Baja California are the country's largest wheat-producing states, accounting for half of the nation's 4 million tons. </p><p>Yet, the scale of agricultural production in these states belies the economic issues the industry has faced over the past two decades. A series of domestic and external factors has combined to put northwestern Mexican agriculture in a difficult position. Over the past three decades, the Mexican government has been moving away from protectionist policies, opening the sector up to competition and exposing farmers to new risks. During the 1990s, the government dramatically reduced subsidies and market intervention programs that guaranteed incomes for small farmers. The government also privatized state-run farming agencies, and this, combined with the decreasing margins for small farmers led to a consolidation of the sector that saw industrial farming operations replace traditional small-scale farming. </p><p>NAFTA, the most well known piece of agricultural policy, strengthened effects of the Mexican government's domestic reforms. When NAFTA was passed in 1996, Mexico saw an influx of heavily subsidized US crops, most notably corn. Unable to compete with US subsidies, more than 2 million farmers have left the industry, and Mexico has become ever more dependent on imports to meet its population's food requirements. The agreement's bans on protective tariffs and increased ease of business have led to net increased trade flows and FDI—but the agricultural industry has taken the brunt of the costs of the reshuffling.</p><p>More recently, however, the Mexican government has shown a newfound desire to support the agricultural sector in the northwest. The election of a conservative president who campaigned on protectionist trade policies in the US has led political and industry leaders to reevaluate the country's vulnerabilities to trade agreements and self-sufficiency. The National Water Commission has been taking steps to modernize irrigation systems to reduce waste and improve yields, a long process that should have tremendous benefits for the area. The government has also invested in new surveys to measure the aquifers located in Sonora to better understand the water supply and analyze what is needed to best meet agricultural needs. Finally, some subsidies have returned to the sector, providing some needed financial stability for still active farmers. None of these actions can singlehandedly solve the issues facing the agricultural sector, but their implementation reflects a commitment to keeping Sonora and Baja California a hub for the industry, which bodes well for the economic future of the northwest. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The northwestern states of Sonora and Baja California, hubs for wheat production, are great examples of both the successes and challenges facing the agricultural sector.","","Northwest Agriculture","horn-of-plenty","1339","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A host of projects, including energy development, commercial initiatives, and infrastructure growth, are expected to stimulate activity in the sector, with the government's most high-profile infrastructure plan, the National Infrastructure Program (NIP), set to be a key driver of growth.</p><p>Additionally, private industry investment projects in areas like mass transit and a revamped energy and grid infrastructure are expected to funnel large amounts of investment into construction. Real estate development is expected to grow as the economy improves, but broader economic headwinds from low oil prices, foreign exchange volatility, and uncertainty regarding relations with the US have made industry observers somewhat more cautious in their assessments.</p><h4>Construction<br></h4><p>The government has unveiled a series of large investment initiatives aimed at revamping the country's infrastructure. The projects set to receive the most funds are those in the energy sector, road transportation, and ports. As the government starts to put greater emphasis on attracting private capital to fund these projects, industry analysts expect the opportunities for firms across Mexico and the region to grow steadily. While there have been some economic headwinds to contend with recently, the Mexican Construction Industry Chamber (CMIC) announced that the industry grew 2% in 2016 and forecast that the industry would grow by another 1.5% growth in 2017. While this is by no means as explosive as previous eras, it is respectable growth that underscores the fundamental strength of the sector.</p><p>In 2015, the government unveiled plans to invest around USD10 billion in key energy infrastructure, including projects in the electricity and oil and gas sectors. This ambitious plan calls for revamping or developing from scratch five natural gas pipelines, three small pipelines and energy distribution lines, and four power generation projects. NIP investments have remained strong despite some broader economic uncertainty, and the plan's 743 projects will continue to be important sources of activity in the industry. Worth an estimated MXN7.75 trillion, the NIP projects are vital sources of investment for many Mexican firms.</p><p>In order to increase the volume and impact of foreign trade, Mexico has also put in place a USD5 billion plan that calls for the construction or redevelopment of nearly 117 ports across the country. One of the most important projects is the expansion of the port at Veracruz, which will be one of the largest ports in the region when completed. The first stage of the USD1.4 billion renovation is expected to be finished in 2018, and it will have a total capacity of 66 million tons. The second stage will cost an estimated USD3 billion. Winning bids for the construction of the port's four new terminals will be announced later this month. Leaders in both government and private industry are excited about the opportunities these projects will bring to the Mexican construction industry. The Port of Lazaro Cardenas and the Port of Manzanillo are two other major port projects that are expected to stimulate sizable activity in the construction sector.</p><p>Additionally, the country's road systems have been in chronic need of revitalization, and the government has committed to reconstructing or rejuvenating roadway infrastructure to the tune of USD28.5 billion. This massive spending plan is designed to smooth the free flow of goods and people across Mexico, and construction firms from Mexico and abroad are highly optimistic about the prospects and inherent opportunities of the plan. All told, transportation and communications infrastructure spending is expected to exceed USD105 billion over the life of the improvement plan, making it one of the most impressive opportunities in the industry and the country.</p><h4>FIBRA</h4><p>Since the FIBRA model was introduced to the market in 2011, the sector has expanded to 10 distinct FIBRAs worth approximately USD15 billion. Somewhat similar to REITs, FIBRAs are essentially investment trusts focused on the acquisition and construction of real estate projects that are intended to be leased. This investment vehicle is a novel addition to the Mexican real estate market, and it has garnered a great deal of interest from institutional investors both in Mexico and abroad.</p><p>Firms operating in this space are cautiously optimistic about the future of the industry, with a core point of concern being not the fundamentals of the domestic marketplace but the nature of Mexico's relationship with the US and uncertainty over exactly how the alliance will evolve. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Juan Monroy, CEO of FIBRA Macquarie, summed up the industry's views quite nicely. “The general consensus is that the fundamentals remain fairly strong,"" said Monroy. “This year we will take a prudent approach to see where our bilateral relationship with the US ends up. The US, Mexico, and Canada complement each other from a number of different perspectives, and the region has become competitive given the existing supply chain structures and FTAs."" As leaders in the real estate and construction industry navigate the new lay of the land, the rhetoric from the White House has prompted a more tempered approach to the market moving forward.</p><h4>Real Estate</h4><p>Leaders in the industry are somewhat cautious when it comes to the supply of commercial real estate, particularly office space, and they strike a somewhat less optimistic note when it comes to market conditions beyond 2017. The steady supply of new buildings in recent years has created or put in the pipeline a high volume of office space that appears to outnumber forecast demand. In an interview with TBY, Luis G. Méndez Trillo, President of Coldwell Banker Commercial Mexico, explained the market conditions that are likely to develop by the end of this year. “While the first half or three quarters of 2017 will be safe, starting in 2018, 2019, and 2020 there will be an oversupply,"" said Trillo. According to Trillo, Mexico City already has around 5.4 million sqm of Class A office space and there are plans to construct an additional 3 million sqm in the next few years. Without equally strong demand, which the market thus far does not seem to be generating, this construction craze will create a potentially destabilizing glut in supply.</p><p>Industrial space on the other hand appears to growing in line with demand. Strong growth in the industrial segment of the economy has translated into increased demand for industrial real estate, but foreign exchange pressures have made breaking ground on new projects somewhat unfeasible, according to Trillo. With necessary projects being put on hold until exchange rates become more favorable, it is possible that industrial real estate will see demand outstrip supply in the near and medium term.</p><p>An important and recent development in industrial real estate has been the proliferation of green facilities. Industrial parks that are more efficient and environmentally friendly have become key pieces of the industry, and more and more companies are looking for industrial space that can offer environmental responsibility. Facilities that incorporate water recycling capabilities, renewable energy potential, smart metering, and green spaces have proliferated, and developers are beginning to recognize the value in offering industrial space with an environmentally friendly touch. Construction projects in commercial and residential spaces funded by private industry have also seen strong growth recently. In fact, CMIC expects that much of the industry's 2017 growth will come on the back of residential and commercial building initiatives funded by the private sector.<br>Thanks to strong growth in the automotive sector, retail space has seen a steady increase in Mexico in recent years, according to the World Property Journal. Developers completed roughly 1.3 million sqm in 2016 in three of Mexico's largest cities. According to BBVA Research, commercial properties have long been an option for investors and developers looking to see better returns and activity than were available in the residential sector, and the government's push to increase vertical housing and more efficient space consumption in urban environments is likely to keep this trend alive. Commercial spaces can serve as the residential anchors for new developments in cities across Mexico, and leaders in government and private industry are hopeful that well-paced and well-placed commercial developments can catalyze important shifts in residential living.</p><h4>Residential</h4><p>As a result of concerted efforts by the government to bring the sector back, Mexico's middle class is beginning to recover from the 2013 housing crisis and the market is improving. The National Housing Plan successfully incentivized developers to continue to build. Interestingly, while nearly 9 million Mexican families are impacted by a housing deficit, it is a housing deficit born of too few rooms, not necessarily too few houses, according to Mexico's National Housing Commission (CONAVI). This has prompted developers to begin focusing on creating homes that include more rooms to accommodate Mexico's intergenerational living habits. The government is pushing for housing that emphasizes vertical construction and the efficient use of ground space, and they are trying to develop a housing solution for the long term.</p><p>Increases in the price of gas and electricity are forecast to have an impact on building costs, potentially raising construction costs by upward of 30%. Additionally, rising costs in other construction materials like steel and cement could also squeeze developers' bottom lines. Rising interest rates could also make mortgages less attractive for buyers, forestalling new construction if demand softens. The Association of Mexican Banks (ABM) expects mortgage rates to rise 5% in 2017 after recording increases of 7% in 2016. This has the potential to price some homebuyers out of the market. Observers are nonetheless hopeful that a strong growth trend in the underlying economy will provide the impetus for stronger growth in the residential real estate sector. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/c6a74954-b3bf-4a89-ab12-ffe6e2023623.jpg","","","","The construction sector appears poised for sustained growth in the coming years as a result of robust fundamentals across a number of key segments and impressive plans for future infrastructure expansion.","","Construction","building-the-future-mexico-2017","1512","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a lack of formality and regulation in the sector has made it difficult to properly measure growth statistics. Official numbers from the Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Privada estimate that the private security sector is growing at around 8-12% annually, compared to around 2-3% growth in the overall economy. However, unofficially, many industry leaders have claimed that demand for private security services is growing at a rate between 40-60% per year.</p><p>The authorities estimate around 8,000 private security companies operate in Mexico, and that around 75% of these are informal companies that are not registered with the government and do not pay taxes. The National Security Commission (CNS) is the government organization charged with regulating the sector on a federal level. In an interview with TBY, Juan Antonio Arambula Martinez, Director General of Private Security of CNS, explained that one of the challenges is the different levels of regulation that exist for private security companies. Security companies must register with the government of the state in which they operate, and are only required to register with the federal government if they plan to operate in more than one state, which includes transport services that cross state lines.<br>In 2010, the federal Private Security Law was updated to include more stringent requirements for companies wishing to register with the federal government and to increase penalties for companies operating without permission. However, the law resulted in many companies registering themselves in different states using different company names, rather than dealing with the bureaucracy required to register on a national level. This has further complicated efforts to understand the true growth of the sector, as many companies are registered under different names in different states.<br>Arambula explained to TBY that the CNS is now working to develop a new law that will apply the same regulations across all states. The government is not the only organization working to improve regulation in the sector. In 2013, the largest companies in the private security sector came together to form the Asociación Mexican de Empresas de Seguridad Privada (AMESP), which raises awareness about the dangers of working with informal security companies and lobbies the government to improve the regulatory environment.<br>There have been debates as to what has driven the increase in the private security sector over the past decade. While the sector began its recent growth trajectory in conjunction with the increase in security problems Mexico experienced around 2008-2010, there are different perspectives on the drivers of its current growth. Most representatives of the private security industry point to an increased perception of insecurity in the country. This coincides with the results of the National Urban Public Security Survey run by the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, which shows that the perception of insecurity in urban areas has increased to its highest level in years.<br>Regardless of its cause, increased insecurity—real or imagined—has economic consequences. According to the Mexican Association of Private Security, Tracking, Information, and Intelligence, the sector generates around MXN160 billion (USD9 billion) annually, or around 1% of the country's GDP. A new report by the Banco de México, Mexico's central bank, shows that according to surveys of economists and businesspeople, insecurity is now seen as the number-one impediment to increased GDP growth in Mexico. However, other figures, particularly representatives of the government, have argued that the growth in the sector is actually the result of a positive trend, namely an increase in GDP, and, therefore, an increase in both the disposable income of individual homes and in the ability of companies to purchase non-essential services like security. œ–</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Private Security Sector","regulating-security-sector","1315","552ef2b0361618126878404e","59c3afec86b7b7189cab7f1a","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current administration's National Infrastructure Program (PNI) for 2014-2018 aims at an investment target of USD500 billion for a total of 743 projects in six strategic sectors—communications and transport, energy, water, health, urban development, and tourism. Overall, 17% of the plan, or USD85 billion, will be allocated toward the transportation and logistics sector in particular.</p><p>Transportation's overall GDP contribution grew by 4.3% in 2015 yet slowed to 2.8% in 2016, likely due to the devaluing of the peso amid a politically challenging environment. Still, experts expect a bounce back in 2017, as most recent data points toward ongoing upward trends in passenger and cargo numbers. According to the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT), the number of passenger trips by air rose by 12.5% to 73 million in 2015, while the number of people traveling by rail increased by 11.9% to 54 million, and total cargo rose by 2.2% to 935 million tons, of which 56% was carried by road, 31.2% by sea, 12.8% by rail, and 0.1% by air.</p><p>According to transport secretary Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, between 70% and 75% of the resources funding Mexico's public infrastructure is sourced from the private sector. Total infrastructure investment in Mexico grew 23% from USD13.4 billion in 2011 to over USD16 billion in 2016. As far as public contributions go, the SCT has committed to investing USD4 billion for work related to its departments, with approximately USD3.7 billion reserved for infrastructure, transportation, and ports.</p><p>In total, there are 117 ports in operation in the country, 59 of which are located in the Gulf of Mexico region. Cayo Arcas comprises the largest share of port activity, with 14%. The ports of Manzanillo, Lazaro Cardenas, and Coatzacoalcos are tied for second place with 10%, followed by Veracruz, Altamira, and Isla de Cedros, which comprise a respective 6% of all port activity in the country. The SCT reports that important advancements have been made in the consolidation of both Pacific and Gulf of Mexico ports, an initiative that is set to transform Mexico into an even stronger logistics platform. Now, four years in, the consolidation projects are well underway, with multi-modal links supporting the growth of maritime cargo to reach 405 million tons in 2016. The SCT's wider goal is to double Mexico's port capacity, adding more than 500 million tons by 2018.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mexico's rail network stretches 15,389km, making it the world's 18th longest. Privatized in the 1990s, the rail network provides freight and passenger service throughout the country, connecting major industrial centers with air and sea ports, as well as the US border. Proposed work for 2017 includes devising ways the rail network can reduce its costs, as well as support sustainable urban development across the country's largest cities.</p><p>In the aviation segment, there are 21 registered airlines operating a fleet of approximately 357 aircraft in total. Mexico is home to 243 airports with paved runways, the busiest of which is Mexico City International Airport (AICM). Under the guidance of the public sector, major renovations are underway to increase the capacity and improve the design of AICM. Government initiatives for 2017 are also focused on attracting private investment toward the improvement of airport and aviation infrastructure. To expedite that process, the government is signing new bilateral air transportation agreements that aim to increase connectivity and improve the level of aviation services in the country.</p><h4>THE ROAD GOES ON</h4><p>There are over 1.4 million km of roads in Mexico, with annual traffic density of nearly 500 million vehicles. The peak year for land transportation traffic was in 2015, when an average daily rate of over 1.5 million vehicles was recorded. 2016 was characterized by a generous budget of USD10.5 billion for the enhancement of this road infrastructure, part of a detailed plan for land transportation laid out by the SCT. Among the work planned for the sector is the construction of 52 new motorways, 34 of which have already been delivered. There is also ongoing work to modernize 80 existing roads, requiring an investment of more than USD4 billion. Thus far, 45 projects exceeding a total of 1,600km have been completed, for a total investment of USD1.6 billion.<br>Leading the charge is the Federal Highways and Bridges (CAPUFE) agency, a government entity with over 56 years of experience in managing, operating, and maintaining toll roads and bridges. CAPUFE currently operates 44 toll roads with a total length of 15,146km, including the principal highways of México-Cuernavaca Acapulco, México-Querétaro-Irapuato, México-Puebla-Veracruz, Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo, and Durango-Mazatlán. CAPUFE is also in control of 32 toll bridges, 14 of which are located on the borders with Guatemala and the US.</p><h4>FLY AWAY</h4><p>With over 1 million jobs and a USD27.4 billion contribution to Mexico's GDP, the aviation sector is a major force of Mexico's economy. The aerospace manufacturing industry has registered exponential growth over the last decade, while the 2005-2016 period saw the number of companies and institutions engaged in the sector rise from 60 to 330. Aerospace exports continue to grow at an annual average rate of approximately 14.5%. While manufacturing is the main source of income and activity, local producers feed into the growth of the sector and boost investor confidence when it comes to building new airports, updating existing infrastructure, or expanding airline routes and fleets.<br>Since the early 1990s, the number of domestic passengers has grown at a yearly rate of 4.2%, with international passenger numbers expanding by 6.4% per year. However, that trend reversed in 2016, when domestic passenger traffic rose by 12.4% to 41.9 million, and international traffic increased 8% to 40.5 million. Meanwhile, per capita flights taken by the middle- and upper-class population demographic register at 0.6 per annum. In the domestic travel market, passenger traffic was distributed between Aeroméxico (31.2%), Volaris (27.5%), InterJet (21.7%), and VivaAerobus (14.3%).</p><p>Rising demand has spurred on what could be considered the most significant development in the aviation segment: the expansion of Mexico's largest airport, AICM. The existing facility is already under pressure to cope with exponential growth in air traffic. Through collaboration between Foster+Partners, FR-EE (Fernando Romero Enterprise), and NACO, the 470,000-sqm airport will become one of the world's largest. With the concept “Airport of the Future,“ architectural firm FR-EE designed the building with the aim of “revolutionizing airport design and the experience of traveling.“ Upon its completion, the building is expected to evolve into an icon: modern, sustainable, and LEED-certified. Three runways capable of handling over 60 million passengers per year are planned for the airport, which can then be expanded to six runways and 120 million passengers per year. It is scheduled to open in 2020.</p><p>Perceiving Mexico's massive air transportation potential, Delta Airlines and Aeroméxico recently announced a cooperation deal to transport cargo to and from the US. The two airlines signed an agreement in which customers can work with either carrier to transport cargo between the two countries using an expansive network of flight and trucking options. Moreover, in February 2017, Delta announced its intentions to purchase 32% of Aeroméxico, which will increase the company's ownership share to 49%.<br>For the third time, Mexico welcomed delegates to the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) 73rd Annual General Meeting in 2017, with leaders of the global air transport industry gathering in Cancún. More than 900 delegates and media participated in this year's event, which was hosted by Aeroméxico.</p><h4>SAFE WITH ME</h4><p>Mexico's logistics operators are capitalizing on new transportation links and improved connectivity by expanding their operations at the country's primary ports and borders. However, logistics activity in the country requires heavy concentration on security, and in 2017, new technology has come into play as a method to improve operations. Additionally, opening new offices and taking advantage of face-to-face interaction are major focuses for the coming year.</p><p>GRUPO AMPM is one of the largest and oldest mail delivery companies in the country, constantly expanding its operations to reach new areas faster and at a lower cost. The company employs over 5,000 people, establishing itself as the number-one employer in logistics. “We offer truly great opportunities in terms of jobs for couriers and messengers and need to lead by example. In this sense, we are in the process of continuous improvement within our human resources structure,“ Pablo Moreno, President of GRUPO AMPM, told TBY. The company is currently in the process of expanding its network to open offices in every area of the country by 2020, as well as an increase revenues by 15-20% during the next five years. To that end, Moreno explained that the company “needs to better approach those market niches where other companies do not provide high-quality services, as well as those market niches where demand is not currently being met by the companies in the industry.“<br>TIBA is another of the most established logistics operators in Mexico, with the largest geographical coverage. Following the trend of being physically present in all the areas in which it operates, TIBA is “very focused on the human component of logistics,“ Justin Facey, Regional Director of TIBA, explained to TBY, adding, “This is why we have many offices and will continue to open new ones as we see where our clients need us to be. I see us having total coverage of Mexico and the whole of Central America and the Caribbean. My goal is to continue to establish TIBA as the major player in this part of the world.“ The company currently has 10 offices and nearly 300 staff in Mexico, and is present in Cuba, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the US.</p><p>Security provider SkyAngel pioneered the sector by implementing a GPS tracking system to help its clients transport cargo. Roche and Maersk Line are two important customers that rely on SkyAngel to protect their deliveries. “At least 70% of our clients are multinationals,“ Rubén Almonte, Director General of SkyAngel, told TBY. “We have great knowledge of security in Mexico.“ </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/70bb35b8-ae5c-40eb-a1f8-5ac7fb0e7d6f.jpg","","","","","","","from-here-to-there","1202","552ef2b0361618126878404e","59c3afec86b7b7189cab7f1a","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only 26.6% of the country's total production comes from SMEs. The government of Mexico has committed to supporting these companies and develop them in order to include them in the value chain of larger foreign and domestic companies established in the country. </p><p>Several programs have been created to develop and certify SME's to enable them to sell and produce for their bigger counterparts. Institutions like ProMexico, the National Institute of Entrepreneurship (INADEM), the Mexican Association of the Automotive Industry (AMIA), and the National Committee of Productivity (CNP) have targeted SMEs as a means of achieving higher productivity and benefitting the most people. <br>Although Mexico has benefited greatly from its 10 FTAs with over 45 countries, attracting foreign investment and exporting to large markets, it has failed to produce innovative or advanced technology.  <br>For example, Mexico has attracted some of the most important OEMs in the global automotive industry, making it one of the 10 largest producers of automobiles in the world. Nonetheless, Tier 1 suppliers import up to 85% of their components. </p><p>Mexican SMEs do some of the demanded processes in the automotive industry. However they cannot participate in the value chain due to their inability to comply with quality standards and levels of certification. In an interview with TBY, President of AMIA Eduardo J. Solis said, “The integration of local Tier 2 suppliers into the automotive industry value chain could bring up to USD 30 billion of additional revenue.“ <br>Another example of this is the aerospace industry. There are approximately 400 companies of this sector operating in Mexico that accounted for USD6 billion of exports in 2015. Yet, only 15% of the companies in the aerospace value chain are Mexican. </p><p>OEMs and other big companies are reluctant to get components from these companies due to certifications they cannot complete and standards of quality they cannot meet.</p><p>ProMexico, the government agency that promotes trade, investment, and the internationalization of business, aims to make Mexico a more appealing country for investment and business and is betting on SMEs to help accomplish this. According to Francisco Gonzalez Diaz, former CEO of ProMexico, SMEs are the businesses that produce the most, employ the most people, and pay the most taxes. </p><p>For this reason, ProMexico has implemented the Multinational Companies Alliance Model (ACT). With this program, ProMexico identifies those companies and processes that can complement and supply multinational companies established in Mexico and connects them with multinationals to create joint ventures, licensing, co-investments, or supplying. <br>INADEM has the Development of Global Networks and Value Chains Program, through which it funds companies to improve their productivity and reach quality standards by granting a total economic support of MXN120 million. Each company gets a grant of up to MXN15 million, which serves to fund 50% of its expenses in training, consultancy, certification, technology transfer, product design and innovation, equipment and infrastructure, advertising, software, and brand or patent registration. <br>Additionally, regional industrial clusters have been created in order to identify the industry's needs, link potential suppliers, and support SMEs in their training process. Such is the case with the automotive cluster in Nuevo León, the aerospace cluster in Querétaro, and the medical devices cluster in Baja California. SMEs get members from these clusters and participate in networking sessions, dialog, trade missions, and training sessions. Clusters work according to the triple helix model in their activities, which includes the private sector, the government, and academia. </p><p>Mexico has acknowledged that foreign direct investment is only a part of the formula for development. By integrating local companies in value chains, Mexico can expect to generate innovation, new technologies, jobs, and higher revenues. The challenge is for institutions to successfully implement these programs so that multinationals embrace local SMEs. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Value Chains","time-to-go-further","1260","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In July 2014, the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law replaced the Federal Telecommunications Commission with the Federal Institute of Telecommunications Institute (FIT) as the regulating agency and competition authority for the telecommunications and broadcasting industries.</p><p>The law also included a digital switchover to be finalized by December 31, 2015. DTT offers higher picture and sound quality and supports more channels and features such as program guides and multi-language subtitles. More interestingly, DTT uses internet connectivity to offer viewers interactive television services like home shopping, e-banking, and e-government service.</p><p>The Ministry of Communications and Transport and FIT were responsible for implementing campaigns to distribute and deliver digital signal decoding and receiving equipment to enhance DTT penetration nation-wide with a focus on ensuring access for low-income households. Prior to the analog blackout throughout Mexico, the law requires 90% of low-income households to have decoding and receiving equipment for digital signals, providing a means to bridge the digital divide between more rural and poorer communities.<br>According to data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), in 2013, 65% of the population had an analog television. The transition from analog to digital television meant that the federal government spent MXN28.4 billion (USD1.5 billion) on more than 10 million digital televisions. In 2016, Mexico—along with Brazil, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Puerto Rico—crossed the threshold of over 90% digital subscribers, according to Advanced Television. Conversely, Argentina, Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua have digital penetration rates below 60%. Regionally, DTT accounted for 85% of total television subscribers in 2016, and this figure is expected to reach 94% by 2022.</p><p>This transition makes Mexico the first LATAM country with completely digital broadcasting, reaching over 105 million people; but it also brings several environmental hazards. According to Greenpeace, the improper disposal of analog electronic equipment could lead to potentially hazardous electronic waste with the dumping of some 40 million old televisions containing lead, mercury, and other toxic materials. Greenpeace worked with the Ministry of Communications and Transport to minimize informal dumping and its negative environmental side effects.</p><p>Allocation of broadcasting frequency bands begins with the reallocation of the 700MHz band. According to FIT plans, this band will be reused as a complementary tool for companies of mobile phone services, allowing them to offer more competitive services at a better cost. Also, in May 2017, FIT announced the agreement to classify the 57-64GHz band for services such as communication between cellular radio base stations, temporary urban networks for coverage of massive events, delivery of high-definition video, and connection for smart homes and cities, also known as the Internet of Things.</p><p>FIT has been quite active in supporting a competitive environment for telecommunications and enforcing regulations. In June 2017, the Plenary of FIT issued a draft mandatory standard for the import, sale, and distribution of digital telecommunications equipment in Mexican territory, detailing minimum specifications and limits. Not to mention, FIT is drafting a methodology for gathering information to identify anticompetitive behaviors and to monitor shared networks' adherence to competition neutrality principles. Currently, FIT is in the consultation period of drafting this methodology, and this phase will end in August 2017.<br>According to specialists, 2017 will be a year in which the telecommunications sector in Mexico witnesses additional progress. The tendering of 148 DTT stations as well as 191 FM and AM radio frequencies will change the landscape of radio and television in the country, causing the market to change and have greater competition. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Starting with the first analog blackout in Tijuana, Baja California in June 2013, Mexico has achieved an effective national transition to digital television.

The IFT emphasizes the 16% YoY drop in the utilization of 2G technology in 4Q2016, and 82% and 303% surges in 3G and 4G, respectively.</p><h4>Pay-TV</h4><p>The pay-TV market grew by 10% in 4Q2016, reaching 20.1 million subscribers, making Mexico Latin America's largest pay-TV market, surpassing Brazil, which has 18.8 million subscribers. Meanwhile, the penetration rate increased from 56 subscriptions per 100 households in 4Q2015 to 60 subscriptions per 100 households in 4Q2016. Grupo Televisa, the world's biggest Spanish-language broadcaster, was the market leader with 61% share of subscriptions, including its units Sky (38.1%), Cablemás (8.7%), Cablevision (5.1%), International Television (3.3%), Cablevisión Red (3.1%), and Cablecom (2.8%). This was followed by Dish-MVS with 16.7% and Megacable-MCM with 14.6%. In March 2017, the sector regulator made a surprise announcement and declared Televisa to have a dominant position that could prevent competition in the pay-TV market. The ruling by the IFT is seen by the sector as a signal toward the imposition of restrictions to level the playing field. The company had already declared its profit rates to be under the pressure of advertising competition from its main domestic rivals, and announced a nearly 60% fall in fourth-quarter net profits, as reported by FT, and a decision to slash 2017 investment by one-third.</p><p>Overall, Mexico's telecoms sector generated MXN546 billion in 4Q2016, over an annual growth of 8%, growing three times faster than the overall economy and contributing 3.6% of total GDP. The sector was the eighth-largest sector of the economy. Sector experts suggest that widespread implementation of flat rate plans resulted in a large 28.5% decline in mobile telephony prices YoY, suggesting that the growth in the sector's revenues can be attributable to a rise in penetration rates.</p><h4>Reforms for competition</h4><p>But the results of the 2014 regulations are slow to kick in. According to the Competitive Intelligence Unit (CIU), a Mexico City-based consulting firm, as reported by Dolia Estevez in Forbes, América Móvil's market share, still significantly above the threshold level of 50% set by the IFT, would only be reduced to 55% by 2020.<br>In order to push forward towards this target, in March 2017, the regulator has imposed new restrictions on América Móvil's owner Carlos Slim urging him to separate the company's infrastructure into independently operated units, without necessarily divesting them. The ruling by the IFT was a decision taken after an evaluation of the “asymmetric regulations"" imposed on América Móvil in 2014 that would open the sector up to competition. América Móvil, whose margins have been compressed by the asymmetric regulations and the competition of new entrant AT&amp;T, opted to challenge the resolutions in accordance with the relevant legislature, suggesting that the dramatic fall in the prices in mobile services were the proof of effective competition, making further asymmetric regulations redundant. América Móvil was reported to challenge the situation where it feels it is subsidizing AT&amp;T through the requirement to lift connection fees, remove long-distance charges, and share infrastructure. The company also hopes to win clearance to move into the pay TV sector, an activity that the company is forbidden to engage in under the terms of its fixed-line concession.<br>América Móvil recently announced that further key modifications required by the regulator are the incorporation of a legal entity independent from Telmex-Telnor that will exclusively provide wholesale services related to local loop and shared access and use of passive infrastructure. A formal separation plan of the company's fixed-line business will be implemented depending on IFT's approval.</p><h4>60MHz of 2.5GHz</h4><p>Meanwhile in May 2017, the IFT approved América Móvil's mobile business Telcel's application to acquire 60MHz of 2.5GHz spectrum from broadcast firm Grupo MVS. The regulator approved the deal deeming that Telcel boosting its spectrum scope would not adversely affect competition in the market, specifying that the deal posed no risks to the process of competition and free competition, or concentration contrary to the public interest in the relevant and related markets. The spectrum had been in use by Grupo MVS for radio and TV services over a block that covers over 75% of the country's population. Wireless market leader Telcel's share of Mexico's available wireless telecommunications spectrum thus increased from 20% to almost 30%.</p><h4>700-MHz shared network</h4><p>The delayed tender for the most ambitious telecoms project to date, the establishment and operation of 4G LTE services using the 700-MHz band spectrum to at least 92.2% of the country in seven years, was awarded in November 2016 to the Altán Consortium, backed by Chinese capital and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Management. The consortium was the last remaining bidder for the tender on the national wholesale mobile network. Its biggest investor with a 33.38% stake is Marapendi Holding BV, an indirect subsidiary of North Haven Infrastructure Partners II, an infrastructure fund managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Management. The shared network project, called Red Compartida, is expected to make investments of more than USD7 billion over the project lifetime. It is expected to start operations on March 31, 2018. The concession will have a term of 20 years with an option to extend for an additional 20 years. Morgan Stanley Infrastructure declared that it would be the world's largest open access, wholesale telecoms network.</p><p>The shared network will be established as a public-private partnership, where the government will install the spectrum and fiber optics designed to reach remote corners of Mexico. The network will be rented by retailers, resulting in reduced costs as these will not be incurring any capital expenditure.</p><p>The second-largest investor in the project with 23.36% share is the China-Mexico Fund, which was set up in 2014 to invest in infrastructure projects and is managed by the International Finance Corporation. Other investors in the project are the IFC, with a 3.34% stake, Canadian pension fund “Caisse de dépí´t et placement du Québec"" (CDPQ), in partnership with CKD-IM, with 12.68%, Grupo Multitél of Spain as a strategic partner, Mexican telecoms companies Axtel, and Megacable with 4.01% each.</p><h4>2.5-GHz auction in 2017<br></h4><p>The IFT had postponed the auction of an auction for up to 130MHz of 2.5GHz band 4G mobile spectrum in order to match the changes in the 700MHz auction process. Now that the process is concluded, the regulator has announced the auction will be executed in the second half of this year. It also announced that the bidding framework for the 2.5GHz auction will be published in the second quarter of 2017, ahead of the launch of the auction process in the third quarter. It was reported that the government expects to reach an agreement with the US on spectrum co-usage in border regions before awarding the new 4G frequencies.</p><h4>Prospects for the future</h4><p>The Mexican market presents big potential for international investors, as Carlos Morales Paulí­n, Country Manager of Telefónica, explained to TBY: “There is a huge market in Mexico and this presents a great opportunity for Telefónica Mexico. There are 120 million people in this country and only three operators. Furthermore, Mexico has a large number of young people. They love social networks and connectivity and this presents a great opportunity. In Mexico, we are behind other Latin American countries in terms of penetration of mobile services; there is still a great deal of ways to go in terms of extending the penetration of mobile services here. Finally, Mexico is economically stable. Despite the issues with the US, we will still grow by 1.5%."" </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/187e67dc-4241-4c19-bf94-39149846e67e.jpg","","","","The Mexican mobile market presents large potential for international investors, given there is still a great deal of ways to go in terms of extending the penetration of mobile services there.","","","lined-up-and-ready","1314","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405a","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The labor and logistical requirements needed to keep the FMCG chain flowing have led to a geographic clustering of operations, and Mexico's high supply of labor, proximity to large markets, and well-established transport links with key global chains have made a it natural fit for the FMCG sector from the production side. At the same time, increased prosperity has increased domestic demand for these goods, and the combination of the two has made Mexico one of the most important markets for FCMG firms.</p><p>Spurred on by massive expansion in emerging markets, the FMCG industry has seen significant growth in recent years. Much of this has been the result of demographic shifts. While developed countries have seen salaries stagnate amid widening inequality, emerging markets have seen millions of people rise out of poverty. According to data from Mexico's National Population Council, the number of Mexican households earning between USD900 and 1,200 per month (classified as middle-income) increased by 3.1% per year to become just under a third of the population, and this trend is expected to only increase in speed over the next few years. This growth has had a tremendous impact on the FMCG industry, as new wealth has generated new consumption patterns that have turned the sector into one of the fastest growing in the country.</p><p>Mexico's position with regard to the FCMG sector is unique in that its population characteristics render it both a major consumer and producer of consumer goods. On the production side, Mexico's strong logistical ties with the US and Latin America, low labor costs, and appealing business environment make it a popular choice for foreign investment. Long linked with the US and Canada, the 1994 passage of NAFTA supercharged flows, creating new industrial zones for assembly and manufacturing that have transformed numerous urban regions. The ensuing rise in manufacturing boosted Mexico's exports and, by lowering the cost of FCMGs for the Mexican market, indirectly contributed to the rise in the Mexican middle class.</p><p>Recent years have seen an increase in Mexican investment by some of the largest participants in the global FMCG sector. In 2004, PepsiCo announced a USD5 billion investment in Mexico, noting that its Latin American foods division was the strongest-growing sector in the company. This move, expected to create more than 4,000 jobs, represents the Mexican market's ability to serve as a hub for developing FMCGs and its strategic importance to some of the most significant companies in the world. Similarly, Nestlé also announced a plan to invest USD1 billion in Mexico by 2019 via the construction of two new factories and the expansion of a third. Nestlé, the world's largest food maker, said that its plans called for Mexico to become a regional distribution center for Latin America, with products such as baby foods, pet foods, and cereals to become key products for distribution.</p><p>So what does the future hold? While consumer confidence has fallen since the election of Donald Trump, a falling unemployment rate and continued positive demographic trends have continued to boost consumption. NAFTA renegotiations have been delayed, and a strengthening peso has reflected growing investor confidence that the sector will be able to withstand whatever may come. Moreover, the Mexican government has redoubled its efforts to strengthen trade ties with other Latin American countries as a way to mitigate possible disruptions in US trade and solidify its place as a regional frontrunner in the industry. The combination of strong internal demand and stable production due to foreign investment should allow the FCMG sector to remain one of Mexico's chief economic drivers for years to come. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Despite the economic uncertainty that has come about due to a shifting US political climate, an economic environment conducive to both production and demand indicates that the FMCG sector will continue to grow and be a major part of Mexico's economy.","","FMCGs","good-and-plenty","1597","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In terms of output value, the local mining sector is ranked 13th globally, and Mexico remains the world's leading producer of silver. It is now also among the top-10 producers of 15 other minerals, including bismuth, fluorite, wollastonite, zinc, lead, copper, and gold. In addition, the country is the world's seventh-largest producer of salt.</p><p>Much of Mexico's success in mining can be attributed to its long history as a producer and exporter. The country's activity in the mining sector goes back 500 years; from early Spanish conquistadors desperate for New World gold, up through today, at a time when sustainable, eco-friendly, and technologically advanced extraction practices are growing in popularity.</p><p>By some estimates, the mining sector represents up to 5.5% of Mexico's GDP when accounting for activity in downstream segments. As the first link for the productive chain in many industries, the mining sector is also an important source of employment, with Mexico's 1,158 mines generating some 350,000 jobs in 2016, many of which boasting salaries that are typically 40% higher than the average salary range in Mexico. The mining sector is also the fifth-largest generator of foreign currency revenues in Mexico, reporting exports valued in excess of USD15.6 billion in 2016. </p><p>Aside from its success story as a major producer and exporter, Mexico has established itself as one of the most attractive destinations for mining investment. According to Behre Dolbear, one of the oldest mineral industry advisory firms in the world, Mexico ranks fifth in terms of drawing investment for mining projects. At present, Canada represents the main source of foreign investment in Mexican mining, comprising 65% of the total in 2016. The US filled the runner-up position with a 17% share of the investment pie.<br>The Mining Chamber of Mexico (Camimex) recorded that the overall value of mining sector investments reached USD5.2 billion in 2015, with 2016 and 2017 projected to fall into a similar range. There has been an overall 5.1% increase in mining sector investments since 2014, with new projects in particular attracting a larger portion of the total. According to Camimex, investment in new projects increased 10% in 2016 to reach USD1.5 billion.</p><p>Meanwhile, the value of metallurgical production increased 6.5%, driven primarily by the 16.8% growth in precious minerals production. BMI Research group reported that gold comprised the majority of all metals mined in Mexico in 2016, with a sizable share of 34%. Copper ranked second with 20%, followed by silver, zinc, iron ore, and lead, with 18.5%, 6.5%, 4.6%, and 3%, respectively. <br>BMI analysts also suggest that there are still abundant opportunities in the mining sector, with the potential for significant and quick ROI over the medium term. In an interview with the press, BMI said, “We forecast Mexico's mining industry value to increase from USD15.7 billion in 2016 to USD17.8 billion by 2020, averaging 3.3% annual growth.“ <br>Market stability, a robust project pipeline, and low production costs are expected to continue supporting Mexico as it seeks foreign investment. Notably, the nascent lithium industry should herald a new wave of projects that may appeal to investors looking ahead to 2018.</p><h4>DIGGING DOWN, RISING UP</h4><p>In February 2017, the Secretariat of Economy reported that there were 267 foreign mining companies from 19 countries operating in Mexico in 2016, specifying that, “Together, they form a portfolio of 927 projects in 26 states, 64% of which are gold and silver extraction projects. Of these 927 projects, 11% were at the production phase and 68% were at the exploratory phase.“ The possibilities for future projects are seemingly limitless for Mexico, a country that has only explored an estimated 27% of its potential mining territory. Among its many competitive advantages, Mexico is an especially prime location for mining operators who are in the market to make new discoveries. There are approximately 1.3 million sqkm of land in Mexico that are considered apt for the development of mining projects and have yet to be fully explored.<br>For companies already operating in the country, most current expansion and exploration is happening in the gold segment. Following a dip in production from 135 million tons in 2015 to 125 million tons in 2016, gold output is expected to rebound in 2017. The decline may be partially attributed to Goldcorp's Peñasquito, Mexico's top gold mine, which has shifted toward mining harder and lower-grade ore types in recent years. Mexico's other significant gold mines are La Herradura and Noche Buena, both owned by Fresnillo, Goldcorp's Los Filos mine, and the Pinos Altos mine, owned by Agnico Eagle Mines. The majority of Mexico's gold is mined in the Sonora region (36.8%), followed by Zacatecas (20.2%) and Chihuahua (15.2%). Upcoming projects to watch in the gold segment include Chesapeake Gold's Metates project, Torex Gold's Morelos Norte project, and Fresnillo's San Julian and Orisyvo projects. Fresnillo, Mexico's largest mine, already produces 870,000oz of gold per year.<br>Silver is another precious metal that presents opportunities, with major projects in the pipeline. In addition to gold, Fresnillo's San Julian mine is expected to focus on silver production, with the potential to produce 10 million oz of silver per year. The project is expected to require investments of up to USD515 million.<br>Although experts do not see copper prices making a strong rebound, Mexico's third-most valuable mineral is expected to experience solid production growth in 2017. Southern Copper's USD3.5 billion expansion at the Buenavista mine will be one of the main drivers of copper output growth, with additional projects including the firm's El Pilar project, an endeavor of up to USD300 million, and Azure Minerals' advanced-stage Promontorio project (USD34.5 million). El Pilar will increase copper output by a hefty 35,000 tons per year, and is slated to come on stream in 2018. Meanwhile, expansions at the Promontorio mine will add 30,000 tons of copper per year. In 1H2016, Mexico's copper and zinc output increased by 22% and 4.5%, respectively, compared to the previous year.</p><p>2017 also marks the return of the Undersecretariat of Mining, a governing body that has been absent in the sector for over 20 years. The predominant reasons for the authority's comeback are the growing tendency for international mining companies to enter the sector, the need for greater representation for workers and others affected by the industry, and the need for greater representation of Mexican mining in foreign negotiations and international trade agreements. In an interview with ProMéxico, Mario Alberto Cantú Suárez explained, “It is with a clear and defined strategy that the Undersecretariat wants to improve the centuries-old mining industry in Mexico.“ </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/6f3835cb-f7bf-4acd-a42e-3f31fcf94090.jpg","","","","","","Mining","shovel-ready","1357","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-21T06:58:00.000Z","2017-09-21T06:58:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Reform  & Perform","<p>Three years after the introduction of constitutional reforms to modernize the energy sector and bringing an end to national oil company Pemex's monopoly, Mexico is taking firm steps to open up the sector to foreign investors and change the structure of the whole value chain forever.</p><h4>Uspstream</h4><p>Although being the fourth largest non-OPEC producer in the world, Mexico's oil output has steadily been falling since reaching its peak in 2004, at 3.3 million bpd, and is expected to fall below 2 million bpd in 2017 for the first time since 1980. The reforms came at a time of low oil prices and tight economic measures, as in December 2016 the government announced bigger-than-expected cuts in public spending. Pemex's cut was announced to be the largest, in the order of USD5.4 billion, as the company is struggling under billions of dollars of accumulated losses. Upstream regulator the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) announced at the beginning of 2017 that the country's proven oil and gas reserves are estimated at 9.16 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which represents a 10.6% decline compared to a year before. Over the same period, Pemex reported 2016 crude oil production of 2.15 million bpd, showing a 5% fall YoY as aging fields yielded less.<br>Pemex is set to benefit from the reforms in the sector as it is allowed to establish farm-out arrangements and strategic partnerships across its businesses, which will allow the oil company to increase its production while gaining access to the latest technology. Pemex will overcome the cuts arising from the government's public spending by receiving private investment, which will support the company's objective to become more competitive. Indeed, CEO José Antonio González Anaya was reported to declare in his opening address at the Mexican Petroleum Congress 2017 that Pemex's 2017-2021 business plan is already being deployed under the guiding principle of profitability.</p><p>Sector organizations are optimistic about the future impact of the reforms. In its Mexico Energy Outlook 2016, the IEA projected crude oil production to bottom out at under 2 million bpd in 2020 and to start rising as reforms start to bear fruit, especially with the exploitation of new deep-water development projects, as these are forecast to produce almost half of the country's projected oil output by 2040. This potential will only be tapped with the introduction of foreign know-how into the market. The IEA forecasts Mexico's crude oil output to reach 2.4 million bpd in 2040, while if natural gas liquids and some tight oil is included in the total, the output will go up to 3.4 million bpd. Already, the current stabilization of oil prices at around USD45 a barrel, and the successful completion of a first auction for the licensing of offshore blocks at the end of 2016 have definitely paved the way for a smoother process in expected further auction rounds.</p><p>After the reforms were enacted, Mexico's first round of bidding took place in July 2015, offering 14 offshore and unconventional blocks for exploration to private investors, but low oil prices and concern over the terms of the contracts led to the awarding of only two blocks. After the government eased some of the bidding criteria, three of the five blocks offered in the second tender were awarded, too. The third round exceeded all expectations as all of the 25 available fields were awarded. As disclosed by the President of CNH, the administrator of these contracts, 22 of the fields were awarded to Mexican companies, and the remaining three were awarded to the Canadian firm Renaissance Oil Corp. The commission revealed that the cumulative production of the fields included in this round would reach 77,000bpd in three years, which is composed of 33,000bpd of oil and 5.78bcm of natural gas, with a production cost of approximately USD14 per barrel.</p><p>As round 1.4 ended in December 2016, foreign investment appetite was finally back on track as eight of the 10 deep-water blocks in the Gulf were won by bidders from outside of Mexico. The Trion deep-water field, located less than 80km from the US-Mexico maritime border, at a water depth of about 2,400m, was awarded to Anglo-Australian multinational BHP Billiton as a Pemex farm-out deal. CNH president Juan Carlos Zepeda stated in a press conference that production at Trion is expected to begin in 2023, while exploration is set to keep going for another decade. Pemex disclosed estimates of Trion's 3P reserves to be 485mmboe, and to require exploration and production investment amount of approximately USD11 billion. In March 2017, BHP Billiton signed the contract with Pemex.</p><p>The stage is set for round 2.1, which will offer 15 shallow-water blocks off the coast of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Campeche. The CNH has recently listed a total of 25 groups pre-qualified for upcoming lease sale, including supermajors ConocoPhillips and Shell, and Eni, Repsol, and Total. The list is also reported to include some national oil companies such as CNOOC, Pemex, Lukoil, Petronas, Colombia's Ecopetrol, and India's ONGC. According to the CNH, the 15 blocks offered in the sale contain a combined 1.6bboe of recoverable resources, while the largest prospective resource is in Block 11 with a P50 of 300mmboe. The eager participation by the world's strongest candidates suggests that the sector is perceived to be recovering on a global scale. Round 2.2 and 2.3 are also expected to take place in summer 2017, offering 12 and 14 onshore blocks, respectively. The last round is expected to take place in December 2017 and will be the second deep-water block offering. <br>In May 2017, the first private offshore oil well in 80 years recently began drilling in the Zama-1 well by a joint venture between Premier Oil, Talos Energy, and Sierra Oil &amp; Gas. The well is estimated to have a P90-P10 gross unrisked resource range of 100-500mmboe. Premier foresees a drilling period of 90 days, and a total estimated cost of USD16 million.</p><h4>Downstream</h4><p>Mexico's downstream sector is also in critical need of investments, as the country's six refineries are operating at barely half capacity of 1.65 million bpd, according to Bloomberg. 50% of total demand for gasoline is currently met through imports, and the fact that the import of fuel has been liberalized raises questions as to the possibility of locally produced fuel to ever be able to meet demand when imports will be a very easy alternative. But the IEA estimates that upgrades to refinery units will help to push up utilization rates toward 90% by 2040, reducing gasoline imports to a more modest one-third of consumption. The CEO of Pemex was reported to be seeking joint venture partners for its six refineries as recent reforms have enabled private companies to buy stakes in these refineries. In March 2017, Pemex announced having identified Japanese trading company Mitsui &amp; Co. and South Korea's SK Engineering &amp; Construction as among potential partners for a USD2.1 billion project at the Tula refinery. The project's objective is to turn lower-value fuel into products like gasoline and diesel as part of a larger expansion program.</p><h4>Natural Gas</h4><p>The IEA reiterates that imports from the US provide a highly competitive source of natural gas for Mexico. However, the agency expects domestic production—including shale gas—to pick up in the latter part of the projection period to reach 60bcm in 2040. As natural gas is expected to gain an increasing role in Mexico's energy mix, this will be facilitated by the regulatory and pricing reforms that will be effective in the market, which in turn will be liberalized by 2018. These reforms will allow extensive infrastructure development and the availability of cheaper gas via new pipelines from the southern US.</p><h4>Power generation </h4><p>In 2014, government-operated electric utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) was restructured to allow the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE) to serve as an independent authority operating the wholesale electricity market. The liberalization of the wholesale market proceeded with the launch of two auctions in 2016, which paved the way for private companies to sell their electricity, starting in 2018, to CFE. The third auction, announced in June 2017, establishes a different market structure. This auction allows qualified service suppliers and qualified large-scale consumers to act as potential buyers as a result of the implementation of the Clearing House, an independent entity that will act as a counterparty between sellers and buyers. The results of the auction are scheduled to be announced at the end of November 2017, and the awarded projects must begin generating by January 2020. These auctions offer long-term (15- and 20-year) contracts, whereas CENACE is expected to launch a fourth auction toward the end of 2017 that will offer medium-term contracts. International companies including Enel Green Power, EDF Energies Nouvelles, Engie, and Fotowatio were among the companies that won contracts.</p><p>The Mexican government has set an ambitious target of 35% for energy use to be from clean energy (including nuclear) by 2024 and 50% by 2050. The IEA says that the sector needs to mobilize USD10 billion per year to meet an 85% increase in electricity demand until 2040. In May 2017, Mexico's Ministry of Energy issued three exploration permits to ENGIE and Icelandic geothermal development company Reykjavik Geothermal. These permits authorize their holders to spend three years exploring geothermal resources located in three zones, each measuring 150km, in Sangangüey (Nayarit state) and in Cerro Pinto and Las Derrumbadas (Puebla state). <br>As the number of new players and the diversification of the energy mix increase, the Mexican government is on track to meet its requirements. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/b55b99cd-145c-4552-8768-38aa9951b304.jpg","","","","","","","reform-perform","1223","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-21T06:53:00.000Z","2017-09-21T06:53:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Increasing Penetration","<p>Though there have been challenges in recent years, Mexico's insurance market is showing signs of stable growth in both profitability and premiums. While there is still some uncertainty regarding the larger macroeconomic picture, especially in terms of the potential for new protectionist economic policies in the US and the potential decline of key trade agreements like NAFTA and the TPP, Mexican insurance companies are likely to remain strong throughout 2017. As penetration rates improve and premiums rise, insurers are confident in the direction their industry is moving. Additionally, as the Mexican economy begins to record even more impressive growth rates, analysts are confident that the insurance market will grow accordingly.</p><p>Mexico has remained an insurance leader in Latin America, and its implementation of a new insurance regulation framework modeled after the EU's Solvency II framework is one of the most comprehensive in the region. This framework ensures that Mexican insurers remain the gold standard, and this year a new series of regulations relating to risk-based capital, cybersecurity and Insurtech will be implemented. That being said, reporting systems and infrastructure in Mexico still have a long way to go before they can fully adhere to the requirements enumerated in the Solvency II framework. Still, strides have been made, and Mexico is in a much better position in terms of implementation than many other Latin American countries.</p><p>While insurance still accounts for less than 3% of Mexico's GDP, that figure is on the rise. According to the Mexican Insurance Industry Association (AMIS), the insurance sector in Mexico finished 2016 with 9.3% growth and is forecast to finish 2017 with 7%. In the third quarter of 2016, vehicle insurance grew by an astounding 19.9%, and life insurance notched an impressive 12.9%. Overall, the auto insurance industry achieved nominal growth of 20.4% in 2016. According to Quálitas, the 36 companies operating in the industry had total combined written premiums of more than 91 billion pesos. The top five companies in terms of written premiums were Quálitas, G.N.P., AXA Seguros, Aba/Seguros and Banorte, representing roughly MXN28.7 billion, 11.6 billion, 9.9 billion, 6.2 billion, and 5 billion, respectively. These five companies controlled nearly 65.5% of market share in terms of earned premiums, clocking in a 29.2%, 13%, 13.2%, 4%, and 6.1%, respectively.</p><p>Insurers in Mexico are expected to make greater efforts to reach lower income segments of the population, a strategy that requires heavy investment in customer education. In order to reach these segments, analysts expect new technology and innovative business models to become integral aspects of many firms' expansion strategies. In Mexico only around 33% of cars are insured, and major firms see this category as one ripe for expansion. According to Standard &amp; Poors, government mandates are only a part of the equation, and the most important aspect is tailoring insurance products to meet the requirements of the vast customer base. Another strategy is increasing the points of contact and number of contacts between insurers and customers, a tactic that is intended to increase communication and prop up premium levels.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, Francisco Oliveros, Director General of Seguros Sura, discussed the exciting potential in the Mexican market. “The Mexican market is the second largest in Latin America, while also being one of the least penetrated markets,“ said Oliveros. “There is a great deal of potential to grow.“ According to Oliveros, the market's relative nascency—reflected in a scant 3.5% penetration rate and tiny ratio of three insurance agents for every 10,000 people—makes it strikingly rich with opportunities. The most important thing insurers can do now is “work together to change people's perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge of insurance,“ accordin`g to Oliveros. As the industry continues to make headway in its marketing and awareness efforts, leaders in the insurance industry are confident that they will continue adding customers to their roles and bolstering their bottom line.</p><p>Another market that analysts have identified as ripe with potential is the SME market. The Mexican economy has more than 4 million SMEs, yet a mere 6% of those enterprises are covered by insurance. Opportunities abound for firms willing to tailor their product offering toward this segment, and a number of large firms have begun making inroads in this space. According to insurance giant AIG, as many as 25% of SMEs are forced to shut down due to lack of adequate insurance. This puts a serious strain on the economy, hampering growth within a segment vital to the country's overall fiscal balance and wellbeing. Firms like Seguros Sura are focusing particularly hard on this segment, crafting offerings that appeal to smaller firms. “We have less than 1% of the insured market share, although we have 5% of the SME insurance market,“ said Oliveros. “We have thus focused a great deal on SME products, and we work to make them more robust and compelling, adding a key element policy for life and cyber coverage.“</p><p>Opportunities for insurance products aimed at the cyber sector also abound. As more and more of the Mexican population and Mexican businesses come online, insurance vehicles that focus on safety and security in the digital world are gaining importance. Insuring data and client information is vital to large companies and SMEs alike, and Mexican firms have begun unveiling new products designed to address exposure in these areas. Insurtech has also enjoyed increased penetration with the industry as insurers make efforts to reach their more and more technological clientele. </p><p>Health insurance coverage has been expanding in recent years, too, and the publicly subsidized plan, Seguro Popular, currently offers coverage to more than 50 million Mexicans, according to the OECD. The success of this plan has succeeded in reducing the incidence of impoverishing health costs to a slim 0.8% of the population. Thanks to this program, which extended coverage to those not already covered by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), The Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE) or the State Health Services (SHS), nearly all Mexicans have access to some form of healthcare. That being said, recent surveys have indicated that nearly 18% of the population reports having no insurance, indicating that they are unaware that they may be covered under current schemes. Additionally, nearly 10 million Mexicans are thought to have duplicate health insurance coverage, underscoring an important inefficiency that public and private insurance firms are trying to correct. Secondary insurance markets could provide additional coverage while improving outcomes and increasing the efficiency and quality of the market and the healthcare system as a whole. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Insurance","increasing-penetration","1820","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before the promulgation of the energy reform by President Enrique Peña Nieto, the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) had a monopoly on production, commercialization, and distribution of fuel in Mexico. With over 11,000 gas stations in Mexico, Pemex had long been the only option for Mexican consumers. </p><p>With the reform, private companies can import and distribute gasoline, as well as own resources from Pemex extraction. Oxxo Gas, a Monterrey-based company, opened the first non-Pemex gas station.<br>For more than 20 years, Oxxo Gas distributed gasoline through franchise stations under the Pemex brand. In July 2016, for the first time, Oxxo Gas opened a distribution station in Monterrey under its brand and corporate image. In its first stage, Oxxo Gas will transform the image of its 50 stations in the Monterrey area. In the future, they expect to change the image of their 335 stations in 14 states across Mexico.<br>The Texan company Gulf is also interested in entering the Mexican gas market. In 2016, Gulf Mexico announced its intention to dominate at least 18% of the market. In its future stations, it plans to offer a high-quality service with modern facilities. It is expected to open over 2,000 service stations by the end of 2018. With imported fuel from California and Texas, it has benefited from the energy reform that allows companies to buy fuel abroad and distribute it in Mexico. <br>Gulf Mexico planned to open its first service stations in Mexico City and Monterrey by 2016, but since the Mexican government announced the liberalization of the oil prices, they decided to put plans on hold until this happens.<br>Starting in January 2017, the prices of gasoline and diesel will be determined by the market for the very first time. This is a reaction after years of price fixation by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. In the past, this situation was not sustainable for the Mexican government; therefore, there were periodical increases in gas prices. Price liberalization will occur in a gradual way, starting in some regions of the country. The government of Mexico expects that by 2018, prices will be liberated in the entire country, allowing free competition among private companies that sell these fuels.<br>Along with the price liberalization, private companies will be allowed to import gasoline and distribute it. Through September 2016, the Ministry of Energy granted at least 115 permits to private companies to import gasoline; nevertheless, none of these had been used. <br>National and foreign companies see the price liberalization and the market opening to private companies as a good opportunity to increase competitiveness and grow their operations. <br>“We will continue to expand our activities in the Mexican market as foreign companies demonstrate more interest in this market, especially midstream and downstream fuel companies"", said Francisco Javier Vargas, Director General of Petrogras, a company that owns over 300 service stations in Mexico. He added that increasing safety consciousness is driving modernization and adding more investors into the fray. <br>Pemex is today the largest company in Mexico, but years of price fixation, ineffective administration, and financial issues have obliged the government to come up with alternatives. The energy reform will allow new players into the arena whose success will be determined by market forces. Being an important producer of crude oil, Mexico still imports gasoline, while fixing prices. It will be a matter of time to see if these initiatives will benefit Mexican consumers. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","After a liberalization of the energy market, many foreign energy companies are now looking toward Mexico and its oil and gas reserves as well as the distribution networks.","","Liberalization of Retail Fuel Sales","pesos-at-the-pump","1301","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It remains to be seen what the future brings, but initial signs are positive that the peso can remain one of the top emerging-market currencies in the globe.</p><p>Classified as an emerging-market currency, the peso is highly dependent on the global economic climate and more specifically economic conditions in the US. Unsurprisingly then, the US election of 2016 had a significant impact on the peso's valuation. For months, the peso served as a bellwether of investor confidence about the election and the future of economic flows between the two countries. As Donald Trump rose in the polls, the peso fell correspondingly, due to concern over what his protectionist trade policy would do for the Mexican economy. Trump vowed to construct a wall on the Mexican border, renegotiate NAFTA, and dramatically reshape trade flows between the two countries. As the election dragged on, the peso continued to lose value: from January 2016 through the end of October, the peso fell more than 10%, though this number hardly tells the full story of the currency's volatility. <br>In the midst of this uncertain climate, Mexico's Central Bank took aggressive action to check the peso's devaluation. The Banco de Mexico raised its benchmark interest rate from 3.75% to 4.25% in June 2016, and then raised it again to 4.75% in September. At its highest rate since the global economic crisis of 2009, the mark reflected the bank's desire to prevent inflation. <br>Following the election of President Trump. the peso dropped by 9% overnight to reach an all-time low of more than MXN20 to the dollar. The slide continued into early 2017, with the peso accelerating to a new low of MXN22.03 per USD after Trump's speech that threatened US auto companies with high taxes on vehicles manufactured in Mexico. Mexico's central bank took further action after the election, raising the interest rate to 5.25% in November, then to 5.75% in December and 6.25% in February. The central bank also sold USD2 billion in reserves in early January 2016 to further support the peso and stave off inflation, which had accelerated by 4.72% YoY as of January 2017, well above the central bank's target rate of 3%.<br>No single entity can take full credit for the peso's ensuing resurgence, but the central bank's aggressive action has been widely praised. June 2017 saw the peso hit a 14-month high of MXN17.8 to the dollar after six months of steady performance that has seen it gain 15.3% against the dollar. Analysts, almost uniformly pessimistic about the peso eight months earlier, now project the currency to continue to strengthen; an early July Goldman Sachs report projected the peso to continue to strengthen to MXN17 per dollar by July 2018. <br>Though inflation rose to 6.3% in June 2017, financial leaders noted that economic indicators all pointed to inflation peaking soon and then converging on the bank's 3% target. Mexico has also benefited from a robust export economy that has formed new ties with Asian nations, giving investors confidence that any changes in US policy will not have outsize effects.<br>Trump's threats of new tariffs and protectionist policies have taken a backseat to other initiatives, and as a result, investors expect any potential renegotiation of NAFTA to be less destabilizing to the Mexican economy than originally feared. The fact remains that Mexico's currency is greatly affected by the political and economic situation in the US. Still, Mexico's prudent reaction to the political uncertainty and resulting currency depreciation of 2016 has given global markets confidence that they are more than able to deal with whatever the future may hold. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","All things considered, the Mexican peso has weathered the storm called Trump better than expected and is coming back stronger than ever.","","Peso Valuation","down-and-up-again","1213","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GDP per capita sits at around USD10,000, placing it in the “upper middle income"" bracket of countries, and despite a slowdown in activity at the end of last year, growth is forecast to pick up again in 2017. According to the OECD, free trade policies, high volumes of FDI, and successful involvement in global value chains have allowed Mexico and Mexican industry to expand at unprecedented levels in recent years. With one of the most advanced manufacturing bases in the hemisphere and the world and one of the lowest barriers to entry, Mexico is a global leader in manufacturing and is likely to remain an important destination for companies from around the globe. According to the World Bank, industry accounts for nearly 26% of Mexico's GDP. </p><p>Automotive</p><p>A major component of Mexico's manufacturing base is the automotive sector. This industry has been a major engine of growth for the economy in recent years, adding 3% to the Mexican GDP, accounting for over 18% of manufacturing GDP, and representing more than 900,000 direct jobs. Thanks to these strong figures, Mexico is the world's seventh-largest manufacturer and fourth-largest exporter of light vehicles, according to the Mexican Association of the Automotive Industry. Additionally, the sector has received one of the largest shares of FDI over the last half decade, receiving more than USD21 billion. On the back of this and future investment, the Mexican automotive industry is forecast produce almost five million light vehicles at 30 production factories for 13 major brands.</p><p>The heavy vehicle manufacturing sector has been equally successful. In the last 10 years the industry has grown, expanding from 17 to 35% of the region's entire heavy vehicle manufacturing. There are 11 plants spread across eight states, accounting for 25,000 direct jobs, 5% of the manufacturing GDP. Vehicles produced in these plants literally keep the economy moving, accounting for 56% of all goods transported in the entire nation and 83% of the land cargo, while the buses manufactured at these plants carry more than 98% of land passengers moved in the country, according to the National Association of Manufacturers of Buses, Trucks and Tractors (ANPACT). According to the most recently available statistics, Mexico produced 190,978 heavy vehicles, 92,985 of which were fifth wheel trucks valued at more than USD8.5 billion dollars. In an attempt to consolidate their status as the global leader in heavy vehicle manufacturing, ANPACT has set a production goal of 300,000 units by 2030.</p><p>The auto parts industry has also been faring quite well in recent years, and Mexico is currently the world's sixth-largest producer of auto parts. The National Auto Parts Industry (NAPI) expects the industry will reach a valuation of USD100 billion, putting it behind only China, the US, and Japan in terms of overall size.<br>Though there has been some discussion within the industry regarding the negative impact the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) could have on Mexican manufacturers, leaders in the industry are confident they are well positioned to continue to thrive. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Eduardo Solis, President of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association, discussed his organization's view on the TPP and the effect it will have on Mexican manufacturers. “Mexico has proven to be a major player and one of the best auto manufacturers in the world,"" said Solis. “The TPP will allow for an element that is quite valuable to us, which is the possibility of accumulating origin from other countries."" By allowing for regional accumulation, Solis and other leaders in the industry are confident that the TPP will lead to positive developments in Mexico's domestic automotive market.</p><h4>Aerospace</h4><p>In recent years, Mexico has established itself as a leader in aerospace manufacturing, and the industry is now among the three largest manufacturing industries in the entire country. This development has come thanks to serious investment from foreign firms and pointed efforts on behalf of the Mexican government, and the industry has since developed into one of Mexico's key engines of growth. Annually, the industry has generated over USD3 billion worth of activity in the last few years, and nearly 200 aerospace firms employing more than 200,000 people now call Mexico home. Current growth forecasts expect the industry to add over 35,000 more jobs in the next five years.<br>Firms in the aerospace industry have flocked to Mexico thanks to its low-cost workforce and relative ease of doing business, and the industry has become adept at producing everything from turbines, fuselages, and sensitive electronics. With even more support from the government expected to be put in place, industry analysts expect even bigger things from the sector in coming years. A great deal of the aerospace manufacturing presence is located in Baja California—mostly Tijuana and Mexicali— and Queretaro, and Mexico's recognition of high aviation manufacturing standards has allowed it to become a key source for many of the world's leading firms.</p><p>The Mexican government's Aerospace Industry National Strategic Program 2012-2020 (Pro-Aereo) is the roadmap for developing the industry, and it has been quite successful. It seeks to position Mexico as a top-10 supplier for the global aerospace industry, generating over USD12 billion in exports by 2020. Through a series of programs focused on market development, technological and human resource advancement, and vertical integration, Mexico has made serious strides toward putting its industry at the fore of global supply chains.</p><h4>Textiles</h4><p>With low labor costs and proximity to both the US and key global trade networks, Mexico's textile industry is an important component of its economy. According to the Mexican National Institute of Statistics Geography (INEGI), the industry is predominantly located in the northeastern and central parts of the country. According to the Mexican Textile Association, the industry employed over 130,000 people as of July 2016, making it one of the largest employers in the country. Additionally, the industry exported more then USD3.5 billion worth of textiles and ready-made products in 2016.</p><p>In the first six months of 2016, North America was the largest export market for raw Mexican textiles while Central America and Asia and Europe came in second and third, accounting for USD409.4 million, USD126.7 million, and USD28.6 million, respectively. In terms of finished products, however, North America was by far the largest export market in that same period, accounting for nearly USD2.79 billion in exports. Germany was the largest source of textile machinery for the country, with USD65.3 million worth imported in the first six months of 2016. Italy, China, and the US came in second, third, and fourth with USD24.2 million, USD14.6 million, and USD11.6 million, respectively.</p><p>Though there has been some concern in certain circles regarding the potential for protectionist policies coming from the US, industry leaders are confident that the Mexican textile industry is strong enough to weather the uncertainty. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Rafael Kalach, Director General of KALTEX, discussed his take on the industry and the potential for uncertainty. “We will have to see what will happen with the new US administration, though I am optimistic that it will not destroy our industry,"" said Kalach. “Notwithstanding our cultural differences, both countries want to improve and their integrated value chains are already linked, and that is something that cannot be undone."" The depth and breadth of the two marketplaces' connections are such that Mexican business leaders are confident that an extensive and profitable relationship will persist.</p><h4>Electronics Manufacturing </h4><p>Home to one of the most extensive electronics manufacturing hubs outside of Asia, Mexico is a major global player in this area. With FDI approaching USD13 billion over the last couple of years, the industry has rapidly developed, and the country now manufactures a wide variety of electronics, varying from simple consumer electronics to sophisticated components for aerospace. In 2015 alone, Mexican electronics exports totaled more than USD51 billion. Nearly 30% of the electronics produced in Mexico are consumer electronics, while a significant portion of the rest are composed of circuit boards, LCD panels, mobile phone components, appliances, and communications equipment. From now until 2020, the Mexican electronics manufacturing industry is forecast to grow at almost 5% a year. With more than 730 electronics manufacturing plants in Mexico, mostly concentrated in the northern states, the industry has established itself as a key source of growth and employment in the country.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, Craig Breese, CEO of Honeywell, which has over 15 manufacturing sites in Mexico and employs over 17,500 people, discussed his vision for Mexico in Honeywell's global strategy. With an ever-greater percentage of Honeywell's revenue coming from software solutions and huge potential identified in Latin America, the company has constructed its new Honeywell Technology Solutions Center in Mexico City. According to Breese, this center will place Mexico firmly at the fore of developments that are fundamentally reshaping Honeywell into a company primary focused on “cyber-industrial"" production. As with leaders in the textile space, electronics manufacturers remain optimistic about the impact protectionist policies in the US. Mexico has developed such a rich and advanced manufacturing base that leaders in the industry are confident that US firms will continue to look south when determining where to establish operations. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/dc344cc6-227d-41da-a58b-0eac2516dcc5.jpg","","","","Thanks to an impressive recent history of FDI and domestic commitment, the Mexican automotive industry is one of the most robust and vital in the world, and analysts are confident that this is likely to remain true.","","","making-the-grade","1687","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-20T12:53:00.000Z","2017-09-20T12:53:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Rolling with the Punches","<p>Once the shock of Trump's victory had settled, investors assessed which markets would buckle under protectionist rhetoric. Yet Trump was not Mexico's only downer, and when the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV) benchmark IPC index shed 3.68% in the post-election week, it was its third consecutive loss, with Pemex having made a gigantic USD32 billion loss in 2015. Yet in the capital markets even dead cats bounce, and soon the BMV was being touted as a must-buy since often... </p><h4>Reality Trumps Rhetoric</h4><p>On November 7, as polls indicated victory for Clinton, and the benchmark stock index was trading at a high 18.6x estimated earnings, the benchmark IPC index rose 3% to 48,091.15, in its greatest advance since December 2014, with aviation stocks the notable risers. Yet by November 17, the index had shed 16% on widespread concerns that Trump would scrap the NAFTA agreement and move on the remittances of Mexican workers (with an estimated potential cost of 6% to Mexico's GDP). Then in early March a Mexican wave blew through the BMV, whereby it recovered its post-US election losses, even exceeding its previous intraday record of 48,956.06 of August 2016.</p><p>Historically, the IPC Index peaked at49,939.47 in May 2017 and troughed at 14,008.20 in August 2005. Supporting this performance was a robust US economy primed to buy from Mexican manufacturers, and silence on NAFTA. Trump's rhetoric may well stop short of costing voters more at the mall. In fact, retail provides an excellent example of the BMV's resilience to noise from Washington. Looking at the shares of Walmart Stores Inc. and Walmart de Mexico, in the year-to-March, while the former had gained just 1%, the latter had appreciated 12% amid confidence in Mexico's bigger picture. Stabilizing oil prices also played a key role in whetting investors' appetite. The simple fact is that while Trump's tub-thumping served as grist for the campaign mill, the US and Mexico have a complex relationship established over decades; one of mutual dependence not easily ditched.</p><h4>The Bourse at a Glance<br></h4><p>Mexico's sole bourse, the BMV is the largest capital market in Latin America, after Brazil's BM&amp;F Bovespa. It is also the fifth- largest in the Americas. While Mexico has appealed to investors keen on its high-yielding, investment-grade, and fixed-income assets, the BMV's overall value by equities remains at a relative low of around 40% of GDP. Essentially, with its performance contingent upon overall sentiment toward EMs, it has benefitted from low prevailing interest rates in advanced economies. A vertically integrated business group, the BMV operates the exchange, as well as the MexDer futures and options derivatives market, the SIF-ICAP over-the-counter (OTC) inter-dealer market for fixed-income and derivatives products, and the custody and settlement and clearing operations. Stocks are apportioned to 13 specialized market indices, and the broadest benchmark index is the IPC, a market capitalization weighted index of 20 to 25 of the BMV's most highly marketable issuers, with a minimum market value of USD100 million, revised semi-annually. As for 1Q2017, for the total market the daily average value traded, at MXN15.8 billion, was 5% up, while the daily average volume of 294.9 million was down 18% YoY.</p><h4>Selected Performance </h4><p>For 1Q2017, BMV's revenues rose 15% to MXN771 million and expenses by 5% YoY, while net income appreciated 22% to a fresh record high of MXN277 million. EBITDA grew 24% with an EBITDA margin of 57%, breaching a new record high for the fifth consecutive quarter. Operating income of MXN417,897 was up 25% YoY, on an operating margin of 54.2%. In terms of profitability, EBITDA was at MXN436,959, up 24% YoY, on an EBITDA margin of 56.7%. The fact remains though that close to 70% of Mexican states are absent from the bourse, which has curbed interest in Mexico that might have come from its membership of a regional club.</p><p>MIL(A) Gracias<br>The Latin American Integrated Market (MILA) emerged in 2011 as the respective bourses of Chile, Peru, and Colombia joined hands. Already the region's greatest exchange by number of listed companies, Mexico's entry in June 2014 doubled its scale, with a combined MCap of around USD1 trillion and close to 1,000 issuers, exceeding Brazil's Bovespa, historically Latin America's largest and most liquid bourse. By 2Q016 MCap had reached USD836.271 billion. When MILA's trading volume soared from USD6.9 million in November 2014 to USD18.8 million a month later, the BVM accounted for almost 80% of the total. As of June 16, 2017 the S&amp;P MILA Andean 40 Index, closing at 668.21, had printed a 1-year rise of 14.76% and 52-week range of 583.23-701.76.</p><h4>Energetic Thinking</h4><p>Mexico's landmark energy reform of 2013 left investors wanting to share in the sector's spoils. Hearing the demand, keen to ensure that related state-enterprises remained competitive, and wishing to secure fresh financing sources for energy-related projects, the government in 3Q2015 announced a new security to be traded in the capital markets. Enter the Mexican infrastructure and energy trust, or Fideicomiso de Inversión en Energí­a e Infraestructura (FIBRA-E). FIBRA-E sponsor firms effectively securitize portions of their mature oil and gas assets (excluding upstream activities), and energy and/or infrastructure projects, with investors sharing subsequent returns. Related regulation entered into effect on October 1, 2015, sweetening the offer.</p><h4>IPO? That's the Spirit</h4><p>Mexico's first IPO on June 13, 2008, was a reflexive affair, as the BMV itself went public, with more than 13,600 individual investors buying shares priced at 16.50 pesos each. In 2015 the local market boasted eight IPOs valued at around USD2 billion. An additional USD900 million was issued through real-estate investment trusts (REITs) and the abovementioned infrastructure development funds. Fast forward to February 2017, where glasses clinked as Mexico's Jose Cuervo, the world's leading tequila producer raised over USD900 million at its IPO. The stock subsequently soared to an intraday gain of 8% on its first trading day, though ultimately closing 4.9% up.</p><p>The event was a useful barometer of market sentiment, having been twice postponed in 2016 at the height of Trump's rhetoric, as the peso tumbled. And returning to energy, new oil and gas venture Vista Oil &amp; Gas, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in June applied for an IPO. Riverstone, a major private equity backer in the energy sector, and a force behind Vista Oil &amp; Gas, had also formed the Silver Run Acquisition Corp SPAC that went public in 1Q2016, and that printed an MCap of USD4.1 billion within a year. With just one listed energy entity on the BMV, the latest IPO will likely register notable appeal.</p><h4>Bonding Time</h4><p>Mexico is the region's second-largest bond market after Brazil, having burgeoned over the past decade amid greater liquidity. Indeed, the risk of a deleterious effect on the market arouse should the vast amount of foreign investment in government paper be reversed. By 2015 government and government-related bonds comprised the bulk of Mexico's bond market at 85.9%. Mexico's 10-year bond closed at 6.87% on June 19, 2017, having historically peaked at 12.24% in September 2001 and troughed at 4.42% in May 2013.</p><p>Prospective IPO activity attests to the fact that the BMV seems set for an interesting year, regardless of prevailing headwinds. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Capital Markets","rolling-with-the-punches","1342","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-20T12:42:00.000Z","2017-09-20T12:42:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Easier and  Faster Credit","<p>As an alternative for people that cannot access traditional financial services, multiple purpose financial societies (SOFOMs) are taking over the Mexican credit market. According to the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), there are 46 registered multipurpose commercial banks. On the other hand, it is reported that more than 2,800 SOFOMs exist in the country.</p><p>SOFOMs have undoubtedly become part of the competition of financial services in the country. Since the crisis of 2008, traditional banks have set up more strict filters to grant credit. Entrepreneurs and cooperatives have seen this as an opportunity to cater to portions of the population that cannot request credit in commercial banks because they do not meet the minimal requirements.</p><p>SOFOMs usually target sectors of the population who may have greater difficulties accessing traditional forms of credit, such as rural communities, the elderly living on pensions, people without credit history, those with bad credit records, or SMEs. SOFOMs grant credit to these groups using easy, flexible and quick filters through financial products and services. In contrast to traditional banking institutions, SOFOMs do not get their credit resources from the general public unless they are authorized to do so. This means that people cannot open saving accounts with such institutions.</p><p>According to CNBV's latest report on financial inclusion, only 39% of Mexican adults have a savings account. It also reported that only 68.9% of the country's municipalities have access points to make banking transactions. Additionally, about 80% of Mexicans have a negative credit record. </p><p>“Due to banking regulations, banks cannot lend any money to someone who is overdue on a loan, even if it is only by one peso. There are millions of people who are in this situation in Mexico who need credit but cannot access bank funds,“ said Elias Rahmane, Director General of Exitus Credit, to TBY. He added that traditional institutions have long and complex processes before bestowing credit. </p><p>In addition to the segments of the population that have seen SOFOMs as an alternative to credit, SMEs have taken advantage of these institutions to start or grow their operations. According to the Bank of Mexico, 26% of the country's micro and small companies get credits from SOFOMs, as well as 14% of the nation's medium-sized enterprises. </p><p>Nonetheless, there is uncertainty about the trustworthiness of these institutions among the general population. Normally SOFOMs are small companies funded by their own capital who then look for private and public financing sources. Most SOFOMs have a capital smaller than MXN1 million and have interest rates of 50% on average.</p><p>The National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Financial Service Users (Condusef) regulates SOFOMs and other financial institutions, along with the Bank of Mexico and the CNBV. Condusef is in charge of sanctioning those financial institutions that fail to protect the interest of their users. This commission also orients users on the financial services they need and the trustworthiness of any kind of financial institution. Even though Condusef has advised against accepting credit from certain institutions, many of the sanctions it applies to SOFOMs are due to errors committed during their incorporation process.</p><p>SOFOMs need to be registered in Condusef's catalog of financial service providers. Moreover they have to report their activities and follow CNBV's regulations on money laundry prevention, contracts, and operations registry. </p><p>Although SOFOMs are a somewhat new solution for credit, there are more and more companies offering products and services to segments not catered to by traditional institutions. There is still a continuous process of regulation of SOFOMs, though the market for this kind of institution is growing, and banks are facing new challenges to keep up with this transformation. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SOFOMs","easier-and-faster-credit","1221","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-20T12:21:00.000Z","2017-09-20T12:21:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Writing  on the Wall","<p>Mexico's concentrated banking universe features 46 commercial banks, seven of which—Bancomer, Banamex, Santander, Banorte, HSBC, Inbursa, and Scotia Bank—hold a prominent 78% market share by total assets. The system is progressing confidently toward full Basel III standards, and the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) indicates robust growth between February 2016 and February 2017, with total loan portfolio growth of 11.7% to MXN4.34 billion. The commercial loan portfolio climbed 12%, while consumption and housing rose 12 and 10.2%, respectively, making the case for confidence. Deposits appreciated 16.2% over the period, confirming sectoral resilience to headwinds, although both consumer and business remain wary of the ramifications of Trumpism.</p><h4>US, eh?<br></h4><p>Indeed, financing conditions and economic outlook alike have been overshadowed by protectionist rhetoric from Washington. The peso, though now somewhat recovered, slumped to as low as 22 to the greenback in January. At stake are the terms of trade with the US through the NAFTA, as tariffs on Mexican goods could yet materialize. The deposits of Mexican corporations at US banks, exceeding USD80.6 billion, account for 3.2 times the remittances received annually by Mexico (USD24.8 billion in 2015), and it is the latter that the Trump administration seemed to be eyeing, pre-election, to bankroll his wall.</p><h4>IMF remains supportive</h4><p>The IMF acknowledges the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation aimed at improving the public debt-to-GDP ratio, tackling troublesome inflation, replenishing FX reserves and, crucially, sustaining robust oversight of Mexico's financial system. Certainly, the government's 2017 budget indicates continued prudence to consolidate those worrying fiscal accounts amid deflated oil prices (Mexican mix oils are forecast averaging at USD42/bbl this year).</p><p>In May 2017, the IMF's Review of Mexico's Performance under the Flexible Credit Line Arrangement reaffirmed Mexico's continued qualification to access USD86 billion, which the government labels a precautionary measure supplementary to a sturdy fiscal policy framework. Indeed, relative sturdiness is visible across Latin America, although the giant banks are notably concentrated in Mexico and Brazil. NAFTA allows US, Canadian, and any other foreign banks with a subsidiary in those two markets to operate wholly owned subsidiaries in Mexico.<br>In the Mexican corner, among the region's largest is BBVA Bancomer, Mexico's leading player, and a subsidiary of Spanish giant BBVA. Spanning the spectrum of retail banking, brokerage fund management, and insurance, it has around 1,800 branches nationwide. Then comes Banamex, established in 1884 through a merger of Banco Nacional Mexicano and Banco Mercantil Mexicano, and today a subsidiary of Citigroup. Citigroup's declared USD1 billion investment in the bank, despite prevailing ambiguity over Mexico-US relations, is still penciled in for 2020. Banorte exploited Mexico's financial crisis of the 1990s to acquire several banks for nationwide exposure. And last on the list of LatAm greats is Banco Santander.</p><h4>Some Telling Numbers</h4><p>The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017 indicates that in terms of financial market development, Mexico came in 35th out of 138 nations. Other metrics placed the nation in 46th place for the soundness of its banks, 78th for financial services meeting business needs, 78th for the affordability of financial services, 71st for financing through the local equity market, and 57th for the ease of access to loans. When capital adequacy is considered, the ratio of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets for 2015 and June 2016 were at 15% and 14.8%, respectively. For those periods the regulatory Tier-1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratios were 13.3% and 13.3%, while the capital to assets ratios were at 10.5% and 10.4%. By asset quality, the ratio of non-performing loans to total gross loans was at 2.6% and 2.4%, with provisions to non-performing loans at 140.1% and 145.1%. Elsewhere, the return on assets was at 1.6% and 1.7%, the return on equity at 15.5% and 16.5%, the interest margin to gross income ratio at 73% and 73.4%, and the trading income to total income ratio at 3.3% and 4% And finally, by liquidity the liquid assets to total assets ratio was at 34.6% and 32.4%, the liquid assets to short-term liabilities at 45.5% and 43.3%, and the customer deposits to total (non-interbank) loans ratio at 87.7% and 88.1% for the respective periods.</p><h4>Reform and Regulation</h4><p>The regulators of Mexico's banking system are the Secretariat of Treasury and Public Finance (SHCP), overseeing institutional issues, and the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), a semi-autonomous state entity responsible for supervision and vigilance. As well as banks, it regulates non-bank finance companies, brokerages, and mutual fund companies, among others. The Bank of Mexico (BANXICO) implements policy and operates inter-bank check clearing and compensation systems. And meanwhile, The Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings (IPAB, replacing the former institution FOBAPROA) is a deposit insurance institution.</p><p>On January 9, 2014, President Enrique Peña Nieto launched key financial reforms through the Banking Act, redefining the sector. Targeted were enhanced development bank performance, higher financial inclusion, and the promotion of private financing at lower rates to boost the vitality of the sector and broader economy. Meanwhile, safeguards ensured better property-rights protection for creditors and the promotion of competition among financial intermediaries. 2015 had heralded in a new system of courts geared at improving housing foreclosure processes to encourage residential lending, the second-fastest growing credit segment of that year, printing an 8.4% real average annual growth rate. Regarding liquidity regulation, in 2016, while stipulated compliance was at 70%, the leading banks and most others had rates exceeding 100%. Banks are also required to issue an annual Liquidity Contingency Plan revealing their sources of funding and measures to mitigate liquidity stress.</p><p>Reflecting confidence in the sector, the National Banking and Securities Commission (NBSC) cut the allotted time for Mexico's banks to conform with the new capital adequacy requirements of the Basel III reforms from 12 to 10 quarters. It stipulated that in terms of the countercyclical capital buffer, banks should establish 25% of the requirements by end-2016, 50% by end-2017, 75% by the end-2018, and 100% by end-2019. Also updated was the incremental adoption of new operating risk capital requirements; lending institutions must meet 30% of the new requirements by 2H2016, 45% by the start of 2017, 80% by 2H2017, and 100% by the start of 2018.</p><h4>Agents of Change</h4><p>As 2016 closed, rating agencies Moody's and Fitch both anticipated a tough 2017 for Mexico's banks in terms of loan growth and asset quality. The latter noted that to cope with potential headwinds, Mexican banks were adequately funded with impressive liquidity profiles enabled by consistently good earnings. Yet in December of 2016 it forecast loan growth deceleration to 6 from 8% this year. </p><p>Moody's notes banks' oil exposure, citing the liquidity and financial leverage tribulations of state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), among the largest corporate borrowers in the banking system. Loans to Pemex account for roughly 6% of the sector's total outstanding loans and between 30-40% of core capital at many institutions. Furthermore, banks have exposure to Pemex's extensive supplier network. Yet the agency anticipates sustainable robust capitalization among banks, with retained profits set to cover capital eroded by anticipated swift loan growth.</p><h4>Credit Dilemma—Growth or Risk?</h4><p>Credit is only as popular as the terms at which it is available, and a concentrated sector curbs competition. In the wake of Mexico's financial crisis of the 1990s local banks became overtly cautious lenders, making access to credit difficult. Yet this is an unsustainable stance for any nation seeking to galvanize local industry, notably the SME segment. In 2015 domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP was at 32.7%. By official figures, just 44% of adults in Mexico own a bank account, and Mexico accounts for about 2.6% of the 2 billion unbanked adults worldwide. Data of the Financial Services Consumer Protection Commission also reveals that Mexicans tend towards non-bank loans, including store credit cards, rather than bank-issued credit cards. Central Bank hikes will inevitably also raise the cost of capital, impacting both lending and borrowing dynamics. In late March 2017, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 6.50% to reduce inflation towards its 3% target. Yet higher rates shine positively on banks' net interest margins as they charge more for loans. </p><h4>SMEs</h4><p>Across the world's emerging markets, SMEs—often employing a significant percentage of the workforce—face an uphill march towards the credit required for growth. By end-2013, private-sector financing was at a low 26% of GDP, with private-sector credit at roughly 45% of bank assets, falling short of regional markets such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. In November 2013, a bill was approved to foster greater levels of lending, with banking regulators authorized to impose punitive measures against banks steering clear of credit provision. Mexico's statistics agency, INEGI, indicates 4 million SMEs, with 97.6% classified as micro-businesses, 2% as small business, and 0.4% as medium-sized enterprises. Its 2015 study stated that just 10.6% of micro-businesses accessed financing, with rates for SMEs at 27.8% and 39.8%, respectively.<br>To foster banking penetration, which also spells huge potential for the sector itself, in June 2016, Mexico launched its National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to expedite access to financial services. Concerning inclusion, Allan Cherem, the Director General of Financiera Contigo explained to TBY the credit extended to women, notably in rural areas. “We never lend money for consumption; it is always for them to invest in their existing micro-enterprises or start-ups.“ The potential take-up of such credit allows ambitious forecasts whereby, “We plan to grow five-fold by 2021 in terms of clients and employees. By YE2017 or 1Q2018 we aim to serve over 300,000 clients (and) 1 million clients by 2021.“</p><h4>Alternative Routes</h4><p>Mexico's development banks form a second tier that seeks to plug the financing gap for specific economic sectors left by the major commercial banks. The non-traditional banking sector also features exchange houses, credit unions, leasing, factoring companies, and financial lending networks (SOFOMs). Sector reform required SOFOMs to deliver current information to the National Commission for the Protection of Users of Financial Services. While SOFOMs offer financial factoring, leasing, and loans and/or other credit services, they cannot receive deposits from the public.</p><p>Despite the distance yet to cover, as income and penetration levels rise, and the well-regulated sector extends credit less judiciously, Mexico's banks stand to play an increasingly catalytic role in economic development. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/4472f38a-fadb-40da-8058-5690604c4292.jpg","","","","","","Banking","the-writing-on-the-wall","1390","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to foster employment, attract FDI, and develop value chains in other regions of the country, President Enrique Peña Nieto created the federal law on special economic zones (SEZs).<br>Mexico faces two realities in terms of economic and social development. According to the UNDP, states like Querétaro or Nuevo León have human development indexes compared to countries like Argentina and Costa Rica. On the other side, states in the south of the country, such as Oaxaca or Chiapas, have the same human development indexes of countries such as Botswana or Gabon.<br>In order to amend these inequalities, the government of Mexico has designated four SEZs. Some of the benefits that these areas will offer are tax incentives, a special customs regime, an agile regulatory framework, infrastructure, human capital, financing, innovation support programs, and preferential conditions for businesses in these zones.<br>The first zone is the Inter Oceanic Industrial Corridor on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz. Another will be the Lázaro Cárdenas port and its surrounding municipalities in the state of Michoacán, one of the most important gateways to markets in the Pacific Ocean. The third one is the corridor between Campeche and Tabasco, on the Gulf of Mexico and rich in oil. Finally, Puerto Chiapas, in the country's least developed state of Chiapas, will host the fourth SEZ.<br>President Peña's objective is to have at least one company operating in each of the four SEZs by 2018, allowing the development of communities of Mexico's four poorest states to match development of more industrialized areas of the country. <br>According to official data of Mexico, in three decades, the GDP of states in the northern part of the country and the Bají­o area has grown 47%. Au contraire, the southern states have seen GDP increase only by 7%, despite their abundance of natural resources and strategic location to enter new markets. The purpose of these SEZs is to complement social policies with economic policies, allowing the creation of new job opportunities, an increase in productivity, and the attraction of investors into the region.<br>SEZs have proven to be successful in various regions of the world. Examples of successful SEZs include Colón, Panama; Manaus, Brazil; Incheon, South Korea; Suzhou and Shenzhen, China; Katowice, Poland; and Tangier, Morocco, among others.<br>After the approval of this initiative in December 2015, the Mexican authorities expect to begin construction of SEZs by October 2017, so companies can start operations by September 2018.<br>In an interview with TBY, Abraham Zamora Torres, Director General of Banobras, mentioned, “At this point, we plan to have one bidding process in the middle of 2017 to invite international and national investors to be the general managers of each of the zones.“ He added that this is an excellent opportunity for international investors to be in charge of building, maintaining, and promoting the industrial zones.<br>These zones will have autonomous and independent courts with an exclusive jurisdiction. For the operation and administration of the SEZs, the government created the federal regulatory commission for strategic economic zones, a decentralized figure of the Ministry of Economy, which will authorize, regulate, and promote the efficient development of the zones and productive performance of established companies.<br></p><p>The creation of the SEZs, if implemented successfully, proposes an alternative to underdeveloped regions of Mexico that are way behind compared to states of the north and Bají­o areas. It is a new proposal for areas that, in the past, were subjects of ineffective social assistance and poverty eradication programs. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Special Economic Zones","a-solution-for-equal-development","1195","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The OECD, in identifying the positives of the economy, listed its open borders, FDI inflows to date, and Mexico's successful integration in global value chains. Yet now, as that team works to surmount challenges of various altitudes, the greatest peak to scale is on foreign soil. Oil is no longer what it once was, having dented sprawling state concern Pemex and economic growth alike. But grabbing fuller attention of course is the boisterous rhetoric that secured President Trump's victory late last year. The subsequent unfolding of this saga, and Mexico's response, may yet determine the outcome of the nation's 2018 presidential elections.</p><h4>Capital Punishment</h4><p>In recent history at least, Washington has never been such a determinant of sentiment toward Mexico, or a source of economic mistrust. To the sound of post-US election knees jerking, the response was swift, as investors pulled around USD6 billion of portfolio cash from notable EMs according to the Institute for International Finance. Yet all is not as gloomy as at first glance given the well-established and tough-to-reverse commercial relations between Mexico and the US, involving complex supply chain dynamics whereby US citizens enjoy cheap Mexican imports.</p><p>One resulting impact of a longer-term nature is a likely delay in fiscal consolidation due to the hydra of limited growth, steeper inflation, and a weaker peso. The government plans to shrink public-sector borrowing requirements to 2.5% of GDP by 2018, from just above 3% at time of print. Official figures put gross public debt at roughly 56% of GDP, and its apparent climb since 2010 has rating agencies hovering over the “negative watch“ button.</p><h4>NAFTA-lean</h4><p>Time alone will tell if, and to what extent, Trump renegotiates the NAFTA, so vital to Mexico's economy that it has been forced to contemplate diversifying away from its northern neighbor, which today takes 80% of its exports. Notably, this involves exploring preferred tariffs with Brazil and Argentina, and enhanced access to their manufacturing sectors. By 2015, under NAFTA, exports to the US had expanded more than six-fold since 1993. Bilateral commerce in goods and services between the US and Latin America is annually worth USD1 trillion, where Mexico's share alone is over USD580 billion. Trump, keen to reduce the US-Mexican trade deficit as close as possible toward zero, has threatened to tax US firms relocating to Mexico, which would dent FDI, while also early on pledging to sequester remittances to pay for his much-vaunted wall. </p><p>Meanwhile, the US sugar industry has lobbied hard for a withdrawal from a 2014 agreement setting prices and quotas for US imports of Mexican sugar should NAFTA remain unchanged. In late November 2016, Mexico's central bank Banxico reduced its 2017 economic growth forecast to between 1.5-2.5% from the earlier 2-3% based on its Washington woes. Moody's Investors Service, too, has a negative outlook on Mexico's banking system, given the inflationary climate and limited economic growth, likely to erode disposable income and thus borrowers' loan appetite and repayment capacity. That said, attesting to Mexico's economic resilience to prevailing volatility, the IMF in May 2017 reaffirmed Mexico's qualification for a two-year USD86 billion Flexible Credit Line, which the Mexican government labels “precautionary.“</p><h4>Making Good on Industry</h4><p>Victor Esquivel, Managing Partner at KPMG, present in Mexico since 1946, told TBY that “Mexico has enjoyed a great period of macroeconomic stability in public finance (where despite bumps in the road) there has been a clear direction of where the government wants to take (the) economy.“ He notes, too, that “significant sectors such as energy and telecoms have opened, making Mexico more competitive.“</p><p>Structural reforms have underpinned this, making Mexico one of the world's most open markets. Frederic Garcia, President of the Consejo Ejecutivo de Empresas Globales and CEO of Airbus Mexico, pinpointed an obstacle to fully capitalize on such reforms. Because while “the energy reform sought to bring in USD60 billion in foreign investment to Mexico, (the) aerospace supply opportunity is five times higher (...), and less than 15% of companies in the Mexican aerospace value chain are Mexican.“ This will demand greater compliance across the value chain, especially among SMEs, which account for around 90% of production, in order to tap, “global supply chains and better levels of financing, not to mention develop a culture of legality and formality.“ Meanwhile, ProMexico CEO Francisco Gonzalez Diaz recalled how in 2015 the organization had revealed “Mexico needs 1 million senior technicians,“ the point being that, “it is precisely SMEs that offer jobs for these people.“ </p><h4>Buying &amp; Selling </h4><p>In 2016, Mexico imported USD387.1 billion of goods, up 65.1% since 2009, but down by 2.1% YoY. The top-10 imports accounted for 72.6% of the total import value. Speaking volumes, 49% of total imports by value last year stemmed from the US and Canada, both signatories to NAFTA. Asia supplied 35.5% of Mexican imports, with 11.8% derived from Europe. Imported vehicles drove the increase in value among the top-10 import categories, rising 101.4% for the seven-year period starting in 2009. By performance these were followed by rubber and rubber articles, up 95.8%, machinery including computers, up 83.4%, and plastics, up 74.4%.<br>Exports for 2016 amounted to USD373.9 billion, up 62.8% since 2009, but down 1.8% YoY. The top-10 exports claimed 79.9% of total shipments. It is telling, too, that Mexico exports 1.7 times the volume of manufactured goods of the other Latin American nations combined. For the year, exports contributed around 16.2% of Mexico's GDP (USD2.307 trillion) according to the IMF's World Economic Outlook, down from 17.2% for 2015. The US and Canada claimed an 83.8% stake in total exports by value in stark contrast to the 5.4% of goods destined for European markets, yet higher than the 5.2% going to Latin America and the Caribbean and 5% to Asia. Mexico's balance of trade averaged at -USD283.85 million from 1980 to 2017, with a historic peak of USD1.7 billion in March 2013 and a record low of -USD3.47 billion in January 2017.</p><h4>And Closer to Today</h4><p>The March 2017 trade deficit was USD183 million, in contrast to a USD87.2 million trade surplus the year before, thus disappointing market expectations of a USD950 million surplus. Exports of manufactured products in March advanced 13.9%, while agricultural and fishery shipments rose 4.2%. Incidentally, in 2016, Mexico produced around 3.5 million cars, with 5 million vehicles earmarked by 2020. Notably, exports to the US climbed 11.8%, comprising over 80% of total non-oil shipments, where auto sales, up 17.7%, claimed over 27% of the total. Mexico's sales to all other markets combined appreciated by 20%. Meanwhile, expanding the trade deficit to USD1.41 billion, imports climbed 2.81% to USD35.06 billion.</p><p>Frederic Garcia President of the Consejo Ejecutivo de Empresas Globales and CEO of Airbus Mexico argues that “by 2030, Mexico could be among the top-five exporters in the world (so long as) global companies (...) help Mexican SMEs enter global value chains to help us become more competitive.“ In similar vein, ProMexico's Francisco Gonzalez Diaz emphasized to TBY that over the coming 20 years, “the market for passenger planes of over 100 seats will reach USD4.5 trillion,“ 70% of which derives from suppliers. Again, given success in establishing adequate value chains, the current 5% of the global aerospace value chain held by Mexico could “reach 10%, (making for) export potential of around USD300 billion.“</p><h4>Welcome 1Q GDP...</h4><p>The economy grew YoY by a non-seasonally adjusted 2.8% (seasonally-adjusted 0.7%) in 1Q2017, marking the highest rate in six quarters, fueled by services growth. Stronger industrial output rebounded—later in May 2017, manufacturing confidence printed a seven-month high of 47.5%. GDP growth averaged 2.65% from 1994 to 2017, with a high of 9.2% in 4Q1996 and low of -8.6% in 2Q1995. <br>...and Other Numerical Currency<br>By early June, the peso was back on its feet, rallying to 18.23/USD (up 4.1% MoM and 12.1% in annual terms), even a tad higher than before Trump's November victory. In fact, Moody's President and Director General Alberto Jones Tamayo told TBY much earlier that the plight of the peso should not curb investment in Mexico. For one, “there is enough financial flexibility for large Mexican companies to switch between financing in one currency or the other relatively quickly.“ And while interest rates in Mexico have begun to rise, “most of the growth and modernization of the industrial platform has been done at interest rates that are much higher yet allowing for a still profitable business.“ </p><p>FocusEconomics forecasts the peso trading at MXN19/USD at end-2017, and at MXN19.74/USD in 2018. As a result, consumer confidence rose to 84.3 in April 2017, in a sustained recovery from January's record-low of 69.9. Consumer spending, a true engine of growth, could continue to fuel expansion in the coming terms. Also in May, consumer prices rose 6.16% YoY, exceeding market expectations of 6.15%. Inflation, having risen for 11 consecutive months, and peaking since April 2009, was exacerbated by the cost of housing, utilities, food, and energy, plus an earlier hike in the minimum wage. It remains above the central bank's 4% upper bound target.<br>On May 18, 2017, as part of a sustained monetary tightening cycle, Banxico raised the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.75%, the third rise of 2017, marking an eight-year high. This is likely to remain the response to stubborn inflationary pressure. Inflation has averaged at 25.4% between 1974 and 2017, peaking at 179.73% in February 1988 and troughing at 2.13% in December 2015. The central bank forecasts annual inflation declining to 3% by end-2018. Unemployment, though worse than market expectations of 3.2%, slid to 3.5% YoY in April 2017 from 3.8%. It had peaked at 6.42% in September 2009 and troughed at 2.22% in March 1997.<br></p><p>Mexico has the advantages of a strong manufacturing base, and its well-established industrial structures in place with US industry would be a risky venture to reverse. Meanwhile, despite the braking effect of macroeconomic prints, the government remains committed to fiscal consolidation when conditions permit. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/d6bba9ba-f10e-4536-9d57-789bd8caaa3a.jpg","","","","","","","seeing-stars-and-stripes","1228","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-20T07:39:00.000Z","2017-09-20T07:39:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Rhetoric vs. Reality","<p>Starting with President Trump's inauguration in January, 2017 has been a complicated year for US-Mexican relations. Donald Trump came to power in the US on a populist and economic-nationalist campaign that was famously critical of Mexico, promising to build a border wall, renegotiate NAFTA, crack down on undocumented immigrants, and punish US companies that move jobs abroad. In addition to his specific policy promises, his campaign frequently used language regarding Mexico and Mexicans considered more than offensive by many people on both sides of the border.</p><p>On the Mexican side, the government has been slower to recriminate, generally insisting that campaign rhetoric does not directly translate to political action. The government has stated its willingness to sit down and renegotiate NAFTA, acknowledging that the 20-year-old agreement could use updating, and in April, Luis Videgaray, Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affairs, said Mexico had made “great advances“ in its relationship with Trump following his inauguration. </p><p>However, many Mexicans have become disillusioned by the government's approach. Trump's inauguration in January was met with calls to boycott American products. When Ford announced its revised plans to build a USD700 million plant in Flat Rock, Michigan instead of a USD600 million factory in San Luí­s Potosí­, Mexican companies like Coconal and Xcaret publicly canceled their orders of Ford vehicles. Now, as the 2018 Mexican presidential election approaches, anti-American sentiment has become an increasingly common element in campaign rhetoric, and the candidate leading the polls is left-wing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador who has made his contempt for the Trump government clear and promises to end collaboration with the DEA and renegotiate NAFTA in Mexico's favor.</p><p>Despite the increase in negative political rhetoric over the past year, a long-term view when analyzing US-Mexican relations is incredibly important. Most business and political leaders on both sides of the border acknowledge that, as neighbors that share one of the longest and most frequently crossed borders in the world, the US and Mexico are bound together by deep and long-standing economic, political, and cultural ties that cannot simply be undone over the course of a few years. Furthermore, the past two decades have generally been characterized by increasing political and economic integration by the US and Mexican governments, which work together and share information formally and informally in hundreds of areas ranging from trade to security, and by private sector companies.</p><p>Public sector cooperation between the US and Mexico crosses all sectors and levels of government. On a local level, there is the day-to-day cooperation between mayors of twin border cities such as San Diego and Tijuana or El Paso and Ciuadad Juarez, whose economies, security, and transport infrastructure are inextricably linked. On a state level, the governors of a number of Mexican states recently participated in the US National Governors' Association meeting on Rhode Island. On a national level, as recently as July 2017, the two countries signed an agreement regarding energy cooperation to strengthen the reliability of electric networks and improve technology sharing. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents operate in many of Mexico's seaports and airports, while Mexican officials are stationed at US CBP headquarters in Virginia to monitor international cargo entering and exiting both countries.</p><p>The private sector especially has increasingly integrated operations and supply chains across the North American region. As Alberto Jones Tamayo, the Director General for Mexico of international ratings agency Moody's, explained to TBY, “The fact of the matter is that the three economies of North America are highly integrated. Business operations in many sectors of the three economies are tightly linked and depend on each other, not for business reasons but rather because they are operationally integrated and cannot be unwound by decree.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","US-Mexico Relations","rhetoric-vs-reality","1285","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-20T06:47:00.000Z","2017-09-20T06:47:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Forging Ahead","<p>Thanks to Mexico's central position in global trade networks, it has become a key player in international diplomacy. Its influence and interests extend well beyond the Western Hemisphere, and it is taking an ever-larger role in a number of key forums and agreements. Thanks to its various trade agreements, Mexico enjoys access to nearly 60% of the world's GDP and more than 50% of global commerce. With more free trade agreements than any other nation on the globe, Mexico is a powerhouse that derives a great deal of its international political clout from its robust global economic agreements.</p><p>There have, however, been hiccups, and Donald Trump's election to the presidency in the US has the potential to undermine Mexico's vital relations with its neighbor to the north. Additionally, persistent problems with major drug cartels and the destabilizing effects of the international drug trade remain a major point of international concern. The continued struggle to stop drug violence in the country has taken its toll on Mexico both internally and externally, yet there are signs that the country is making renewed progress. Enrique Peña Nieto's presidency has been marked by wide-ranging reforms that have sought to stimulate economic growth while strengthening transparency across the country. Nieto's reforms have not been completely successful, though, and GDP growth hovers at around 1%.</p><h4>US and NAFTA</h4><p>Relations with Mexico's North American neighbors have long been central to its diplomatic efforts. Of particular importance has been the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has facilitated an unprecedented flow of goods and services throughout North America since 1994. During the life of the agreement, FDI in Mexico has more than doubled, averaging more than 2.6% of GDP every year, and bilateral trade between Mexico and the US alone is around USD580 billion. The close relationship between Mexico and the US may, however, be in jeopardy. Recent protectionist rhetoric and campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA by President Trump have put the continued success of the agreement into question. While officials in Mexico have chosen to respond with prudence, adopting a wait-and-see attitude, a number of unknowns remain. Mexican collaboration with the US extends well beyond international trade, and officials are hopeful that outsized rhetoric will not trump sound policy and good political sense.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, Alicia Bárcena discussed the possible impact that the Trump presidency might have on Mexico. “We are respectful of the democratic processes of all countries, and we will have to wait and see if all the proposals made [by Trump] during the campaign are indeed translated into economic policymaking,“ said Bárcena. “In any case, we must be aware of the possibility of a renegotiation of NAFTA and the discussions on immigration control and border security.“ As Mexican and world leaders wait to see what exactly unfolds, they are optimistic that a successful dialog will eventually take place, but they are confident that Mexico has the economic strength and political will to weather any storms that may arise. <br>President Trump recently took steps to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that had taken more than seven years to negotiate and included 12 nations that accounted for nearly 40% of the global economy. This decision effectively undermines the trade agreement, forcing Mexico to reimagine that aspect of its trade policy. With the US appearing less and less like the reliable ally it has been in the past, Mexican leaders in the public and private spheres have begun looking farther afield for international trade and political partners. </p><h4>China</h4><p>As relations between Mexico and the US remain strained, Mexico's relations with China continue to improve. Fears regarding the impact that poor relations with the US might have on the Mexican economy have prompted Mexican officials to seek new opportunities with China, and their Chinese counterparts have been extremely welcoming. Mexican officials have had a number of high-profile meetings with their Chinese counterparts, including a recent meeting between Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu, at which a wide variety of topics ranging from increased investment and economic ties to better flight connections between the respective countries were discussed. Mexican officials are trying to establish a new diplomatic dynamic with China, emphasizing mutual trust and mutual interests, according the Mexican Foreign Ministry.</p><p>One of the first concrete steps in this new direction was the recent China Homelife fair in Mexico City. This trade show was intended to increase bilateral relations between China and Mexico, and more than 750 Chinese suppliers operating in dozens of industries were able to show off their wares to Mexican firms. This fair was the first of its kind in Mexico in recent years, and officials in the public and private sector in both countries expect it to inaugurate a new era in Chinese-Mexican diplomatic and economic relations.</p><p>Chinese officials have also been keen to expand their investment footprint within Mexico, and these overtures have been met with a great deal of enthusiasm. The Yucatan Peninsula, in particular, has garnered a great deal of attention from Chinese developers, and there have been efforts by Chinese interests to expand the area's industrial, tourism, and commercial potential, according to The Yucatan Times. Officials from the peninsula have hosted several high-profile meetings with Chinese business leaders and diplomats, and large-scale investment appears highly likely. By expanding the scope of trade and economic activity between the two countries, officials hope to cement a long-lasting and prosperous relationship. </p><h4>Latin America</h4><p>In recent years, Mexico has also been trying to expand and strengthen its relations with other Latin American countries. Increasing ties with Brazil has been particularly important for Mexican officials, and strong economic and political linkages have been developed. Many Mexican officials see Brazil as a key partner in the future of Mexico and the region. According to Jose Antonio Meade, Mexico's current Secretary of Finance and former Secretary of Foreign Affairs, “For Mexico, Brazil is the most important exporting market in Latin America, and the most important destination of our foreign investment in Latin America.“ Officials in both countries view strong ties between Mexico and Brazil as key for integrating Latin America and strengthening the region's position on the global stage, according to the Development Bank of Latin America.</p><p>With Brazil's recent ratification of the Brazil-Mexico Cooperation and Investment Facilitation Agreement, authorities in both countries have further cemented their relationship. The new agreement calls for a new model for investment defined by a robust intergovernmental consultation process, strong internationalization support, cooperative regulatory frameworks, renewed invigoration of business opportunities, and dispute settlement mechanisms. Additionally, Brazil's status as a global breadbasket offers Mexico a potential alternative in terms of grain import, particularly corn, as its historical reliance on the US for food importation may be in jeopardy.</p><p>Mexico's relations with Latin America are not, of course, limited to ties with Brazil. One of Mexico's other key partnerships is with the Pacific Alliance, a trade bloc that includes Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Together this trade alliance represent approximately 36% of Latin America's GDP, representing a nominal GDP of more than USD2.2 trillion and a purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP of more than USD3.7 trillion. Ties between these four nations are manifest not just in economic agreements, but also in shared promotion entities and joint diplomatic missions in a number of countries across the globe.</p><p>As Mexico has been expanding its influence across Latin America, it has focused on creating lasting relationships through investment and economic partnership.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President of Honduras, discussed the importance of Mexico's investment in Honduras and the implications it has for further relations. “Mexico is not only an important trading partner but also a prominent investor in our country,“ said Alvarado. “With trade of approximately USD1 billion and hopefully rising, I hope these ties will strengthen and continue to generate more jobs in both countries.“ Mexico and Latin America, and Honduras in particular, have been forging close ties in recent years, and as Mexico seeks to further cement its status as a regional leader, such overtures are likely to continue unabated. Much of Latin America's political leaders would no doubt agree with President Alvarado's sentiment when he noted, “I am convinced that the arrival of Mexican companies would not only benefit Honduras… but Mexico as well.“</p><p>Mexico and Mexican companies are engaged in a serious push to bring renewed economic vitality to themselves and their neighbors through investment and trade agreements. Argentina has also been a candidate for new trade deals, and the country's large exports of wheat, soybeans, and beef make it particularly attractive. Mexico, which has relied heavily on the US for its food crops, has considered developing multi-dimensional trade deals with the country. Mexican officials in many different departments have recently articulated their optimism in terms of developing a new system of trade relations with Argentina, and agreements between each country are forthcoming.</p><p>As the political entities continue to make arrangements for cementing relations, companies across various industries are taking the initiative. Interests in agriculture, manufacturing, construction and various other industries are extending the purview of their operations in Mexico, according to US news. NAFTA-related uncertainties have opened the door for many different countries, and the potential for new trade agreements and new trade blocs abound. As Mexico continues to navigate the somewhat stormy seas of its current relationship with the US, its enviable position in terms of global trade integration makes it a valuable and attractive partner for most of the world's largest economies and influential governments. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/c5a94a34-8158-43c4-8d6c-6262276d6168.jpg","","","","","","","forging-ahead","1207","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Latin America & Caribbean > Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-14T13:51:00.000Z","2017-09-14T13:51:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","TAX Playbook","<p>Moving up five spots since the previous year in the World Bank's 2017 ranking of economies for ease of doing business, the UAE has implemented several reforms to streamline business processes. In addition to simplifying national procedures for doing business, the UAE is coordinating with other GCC countries to implement a new VAT. Abu Dhabi has remarkable global reach, increasingly attracting and interacting with international businesses. Statistics Center Abu Dhabi (SCAD) estimates the Emirate's population at 2.9 million in mid-2016, representing a 4.4% increase since 2015. Looking ahead to 2018, the IMF forecasts 4.4% economic growth in the UAE.</p><h4>Taxation</h4><p>While many aspects of doing business in the UAE vary from Emirate to Emirate, the new VAT will be implemented across the country. The VAT is coordinated with other GCC states and will be introduced on January 1, 2018. Replacing the custom duty, the VAT will likely be kept at a moderate 5%. Businesses that meet the minimum annual turnover requirements, as evidenced by their financial records, will be required to register online for the VAT. All businesses in the UAE will need to record their financial transactions and ensure that their records are accurate and updated. Foreign-owned companies, which must operate in free zones, are eligible for tax breaks for an agreed upon number of years, usually ranging from 15-50 depending on the free zone and can be renewed.</p><p>While the new tax landscape may add some short-term uncertainty and increase costs, an important long-term advantage is the improvement in transparency and need for businesses to have well-kept accounts. The new tax will hopefully increase confidence for investors. Because the VAT applies across the UAE, the Ministry of Finance is overseeing its implementation. There are also fees applied by the local governments, varying between expats and nationals due to subsidies.</p><h4>Free Zone Business Model</h4><p>The changing tax policies will make the free zone business model—already very common in Abu Dhabi, the UAE, and the region—even more attractive. Companies based outside of free zones are required to be 51% majority owned by a UAE national, though there are some technicalities where GCC citizen ownership impacts this percentage. For companies within free zones, they are subject to specific laws from the free zone authority (FZA) of the free zone in which they are established. First, free zone entities obtain approval from their specific FZA then apply for a trade license and registration. Free zone registration allows companies to remain 100% foreign owned and operate with exemption from import, export, corporate, and personal taxes. Additional support is provided through one-stop shop services, which help companies expedite the necessary process of obtaining permits, licenses, approvals, and clearances.</p><p>Abu Dhabi has seven free zones, including Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi, offering world-class transportation infrastructure to local, regional, and international markets with more than 2 billion consumers; Masdar City, focused on technology and renewable energy; Abu Dhabi Airports Company, built over seven sqkm within Abu Dhabi International Airport; and twofour54, the media free zone to position the Emirate as a leading player in the Arabic media content creation industry.</p><h4>Etiquette</h4><p>As an Emirate that hosts over 150 nationalities, Abu Dhabi is incredibly diverse. Also considering the significant role of FDI—the Emirate welcomed AED95.1 billion (USD25.9 billion) in 2016, according to SCAD—the global reach of the Emirate makes business etiquette quite standard by Western conventions. Generally, be smart, punctual, and respectful in professional environments. However, you should not initiate a hand shake with a female Emirati and should wait to have a hand extended to you first, as some women may not wish to shake hands with men. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tax-playbook","1334","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was therefore unsurprising when the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development launched the “Culture for All“ campaign in 2016, which, in the words of HH Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, aims to “refer to the complex pattern of behaviors, knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, customs, values, and any other capabilities and habits of the people comprising the society.“</p><p>The campaign comprises seven strategies: overseeing the delivery of the UAE's national Youth Strategy; overseeing the community development agenda for the country; contributing to the spread and mastery of the Arabic language within the country; contributing to the diffusion, understanding, and appreciation of Islamic civilization and the teachings of tolerant Islam; contributing to the development of the country's creative arts and entrepreneurial creative enterprises; and undertaking a series of important cultural events for national citizens and non-national residents of the country.</p><p>The campaign has been partnered with the announcement of the Arab Youth Strategy during the World Government Summit 2017 and the designation of 2017 as the Year of Giving, an ambitious initiative looking to nurture charitable actions among public and private entities alike. Moreover, the Culture for All campaign has been presented as the Ministry of Culture's core activity to develop during 2017 and beyond as the UAE aims to present itself as a global center for the creation and development of the arts.</p><p>The campaign also aims to go beyond the facilitation of cultural interaction and the formation of a diverse society; it also embodies the recognition of different religious beliefs under one single soil, the promotion of Arab and Emirati cultures, and respect among the various number of nationalities living together in the federation today. This is one of the tasks the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development has embraced as one of its ambitions for the upcoming years and to turn the concept of Culture for All into a productive feature of life in the country.</p><p>Part of the campaign's mission also involves the organization of cross-cultural events between the UAE and its closest allies. In that sense, 2017 has been named the Year of Creative Collaboration between the UAE and the UK, through which a comprehensive agenda of collaboration between a wide range of British and Emirati partners will create a diverse program that spans the arts, literature, education, society, sports, science, and trade to be developed throughout 2017. Similarly, this year also marked the announcement of “UAE-India Cultural Celebrations: a cultural partnership for a positive future,“ a commemoration of the extremely intertwined links between the UAE and the country where its largest diaspora comes from.<br>Further events such as the Culture Summit Abu Dhabi 2017 and the upcoming opening of Saadiyat Cultural District, with the Louvre Museum Abu Dhabi, the Sheikh Zayed Museum, and the Guggenheim Museum as its three cultural beacons, also form part of the ambitious plan of expanding cultural activity in the UAE to unprecedented levels in the Middle East.<br>The Culture for All campaign looks set to be one of the most innovative tools of Emirati soft power and aims to propel the country as a referent for arts and culture in a region largely misunderstood. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Culture for all","stronger-together","1338","552ef2b0361618126878404e","55f2c44086b7b0127c11bea0","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-14T13:25:00.000Z","2017-09-14T13:25:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Bringing in the experts","<p>To meet the expectations of Abu Dhabi's Vision 2030, ADEC approved a series of reforms to ensure college graduates get the necessary skills and capabilities to drive growth. The reforms emphasized the importance of specialized and vocational education in the areas of engineering, aerospace, IT, medicine, applied sciences, tourism, and business. Based on the objectives of Vision 2030, ADEC pointed at the need to attract foreign universities to develop areas where Abu Dhabi lacked expertise and where further research would be required.</p><p>Part of this initiative is to provide opportunities for reputable foreign universities to open branches in the Emirate to serve as poles of attraction not only for experienced lecturers and researchers, but also for Tier-1 students looking for educational opportunities in the Emirates. Coupled with a strong local commitment to invest in education, ADEC's partnerships with these institutions are meant to strengthen the education sector and, ultimately, make Abu Dhabi a regional education hub.</p><p>Today the UAE holds the highest concentration of university campuses around the world with 40 branches across five Emirates. In the particular case of Abu Dhabi, it plays host to global education leaders in the likes of New York University (NYU), Paris Sorbonne, INSEAD, the University of Strathclyde, and the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT).</p><p>The presence of these foreign universities is expected to make Abu Dhabi an international hub not only for education, but home to innovative industrial and aerospace sectors driven by a robust and qualified workforce. This will only help fortify the UAE's position as a high-tech center in the Middle East. The focus has been particularly strong on executive education to educate the country's future leaders.</p><p>Among the opportunities brought by these international campuses is the direct link provided to peers in other major cities around the globe. For example, an Abu Dhabi student is able to study in Singapore, London, or Paris, for example. It is precisely this internationalization of Abu Dhabi's education services that has been the talk of the town among private and public institutions in the Emirate. Eric Fouache, Vice Chancellor for Paris Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi, explained, “Today we host students from 77 nationalities, with 40% of them coming from families based overseas, meaning that we are a truly international university and that Abu Dhabi has become an attractive destination for international students.“</p><p>Moreover, as the education landscape in Abu Dhabi matures, the post-graduation prospects for students are becoming increasingly attractive to Emirati and international students alike. Studies reveal that MBA graduates in Abu Dhabi can expect salaries ranging between USD140,000 and 156,000 just three years after graduation. The opportunities given by these foreign universities spurs private sector companies such as Dubai Airports, Aramex, Unilever, or Disney to provide Abu Dhabi business school students with practical expertise in the final track of their studies.</p><p>Another important contribution is the rising number of scholarships available in the Emirate. Current figures show that around 20% of university students in the UAE are receiving some form of scholarship for undergraduate and postgraduate studies, with the majority of these incentives being offered to meritorious and financially challenged students.</p><p>The presence of these global educative players has also spurred on secondary and tertiary education providers. As Miguel Sousa Lobo, Director of INSEAD Abu Dhabi, put it, “One of the most encouraging factors for the long term is the progress made in the quality of the elementary schools and high schools here,“ he expressed. “ADEC is introducing international benchmarks with its new curriculum and this is having an impact on the quality of the education young people are receiving in the Emirate.“</p><p>The reforms passed by ADEC in 2015 unified the curriculum to ensure each student spends 21 periods a week studying STEM subjects. This reform has laid the foundations to provide international universities with the fertile minds needed to satisfy the future demands of the economy. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Business Universities","bringing-in-the-experts","1287","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5583f81d86b7b00e186be187","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even in the face of an economic slowdown, the sector continued to perform well, drawing a record-breaking number of visitors. Abu Dhabi continues to be a destination for luxury goods and services and is expanding to offer new cultural activities with new festivals for Indian tourists, the opening of a branch of the world-famous Louvre, and Warner Bros and Sea World parks opening soon. Looking to the future, the continued expansion of the retail sector and the introduction of new markets promises to further strengthen this economically vital sector.</p><h4>2016 STATISTICS</h4><p>That the Abu Dhabi tourism sector remained stable despite a tumultuous global market speaks to the strength of the industry. The Emirate saw visitors increase by 8%. 4.4 million visitors arrived in 2016, up from 4.1 million in 2015, with India the largest source of foreign visitors at 323,000 guests, a 15% rise. The strength of the growth in the Indian market was especially noteworthy considering the demonetization policies enacted in late 2016 that roiled the Indian economy; Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority (TCA) officials attribute the sector's performance in this regard to targeted marketing in the Indian market, and expect similar growth in the market this year. The UAE represented the single-largest share of hotel guests, with its arrivals of 1,462,015 representing a 6% increase over 2015. The UK, China, and the Philippines rounded out the rest of the top five most frequent hotel guests. The rise in Chinese visitors was a particularly significant one for the Abu Dhabi tourism sector; the 231,916 guests who arrived in 2016 represent a remarkable 313% increase on 2015. China's population and growing economic significance means that cultivating this relationship will lead to only good things for the sector in the near future.</p><p>More detailed trends showed some of the effects the larger economic uncertainty had on the market. The number of hotel guest nights decreased by 2% from 2015, and the average length of stay fell by 9% over the same time period. New construction meant that the hotel occupancy rate fell by 3%, and the shorter stays led to total revenue falling by 9% YoY. Despite these trends of shorter stays and less revenue as a result, the rise in the most important metric—the number of visitors—has industry participants optimistic about the state of the sector.</p><h4>NEW MARKETS</h4><p>Sector participants expect further growth in 2017 thanks to the TCA's strategy of targeting top markets: India, China, Saudi Arabia, the US, and the UK. China in particular has been a source of emphasis for the TCA, which has begun new marketing campaigns on Chinese social media networks and initiated a new visa-on-arrival program to ease the paperwork needed to enter the Emirate. The TCA has publicly stated its goal to draw 600,000 Chinese tourists a year by 2021, almost a threefold increase over its 2016 numbers. While ambitious, that would be only a fraction of the rapidly growing Chinese tourism market; the country produced more than 120 million outbound tourists in 2015 and the market is projected to grow to over 175 million by 2020. Market analysts believe that the limited supply of midrange accommodations in Dubai are limiting the growth of this market, but the TCA is working to increase options and ease the effort of traveling to Abu Dhabi. Aside from the aforementioned visa streamlining process, the number of hotels and retailers who have attained the China Tourism Academy's Welcome Chinese Certification has risen due to new efforts in hiring Mandarin-speaking staff members. TCA Abu Dhabi maintains an office in China and will launch a multi-city promotional tour in May 2017 that will bring a delegation of Abu Dhabi tourism sector leaders to four major cities. In addition, the number of flights is expected to increase as national carrier Etihad Airways plans to introduce new flights to China and East Asia.</p><p>Other efforts are underway to increase the volume of flights to Russia and India, two of Abu Dhabi's main tourism sources. Currently, the lack of direct flights to the region is a barrier to continued growth in Russian tourism; more than 32,000 seats a week arrive from Russia to Dubai, but less than 2,000 arrive in Abu Dhabi. As such, tourists coming to Abu Dhabi frequently have to stop through Dubai, limiting the Emirate's ability to serve as one-stop spot. While the volume of flights is not expected to increase in 2017, long-term plans for the expansion of Abu Dhabi International Airport have created the possibility for new growth. As with China, Abu Dhabi now lets Russian citizens obtain visas on arrival, a move that should help increase demand.  Abu Dhabi TCA officials are also working on hosting new Indian-focused events such as Bollywood-related activities and festivals for Diwali to draw additional Indian tourists. Etihad airlines also signed a USD1 million deal with Thailand's tourism agency to promote its daily flights to Bangkok and Phuket, the better to increase flows in both directions between the two countries.</p><h4>MAIN ATTRACTIONS</h4><p>All the outreach in the world will be meaningless if Abu Dhabi doesn't have the world-class cultural attractions that draw visitors. To this end, TCA works to bring the country's cultural and retail sectors together to create unified marketing opportunities. In April 2017, the TCVA formed an Industry Development Committee for Events &amp; Retail, which includes leaders from the two sectors and will work with the TCA to forge new strategies in a challenging environment. The fall in oil revenues created decreased demand among the high-end retail market, with volumes falling and retailers forced to adapt new strategies to increase efficiency and lower costs. Compounding things, the strength of the dollar meant that Abu Dhabi became an increasingly expensive option for several key markets at a moment when the retail sector was counting on international visitors. The mission of the Events &amp; Retail Committee is to leverage Abu Dhabi's strong tourism market and links to international markets to increase retail success through targeted campaigns. In the long term, the construction of the USD1 billion Al Maryah Central Shopping mall and the USD1 billion Reem Mall will provide greater retail options. Scheduled to open in 2018, the Al Maryah mall will be 2.8 million sqft; the project's developers expect to have more than 75% of available space leased by the end of summer 2017. Though originally planned to open in 2018 as well, the opening of Reem Mall has been pushed back to 2020 due to construction delays and issues with the project's design. Once complete, Reem Mall is expected to have 2.8 million sqft of leasable place and be home to the world's largest indoor snow play park.</p><h4>FOR THE CULTURE<br></h4><p>Of course, Abu Dhabi has more to offer than just high-end shopping. HH Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, Minister of Culture &amp; Knowledge Development, explained that Abu Dhabi is a global city molded by the dozens of cultures that have been present over the centuries. “Our culture has been strengthened by exposure to cultures from around the world,"" Nahyan told TBY, “making us global citizens without losing sight of who we are."" While home to millions of expats, the Abu Dhabi government has turned the Emirate into a global center for Arabic culture and heritage through investment in the documentation and study of the region's history. Cross-disciplinary projects have used the Emirate's numerous global connections to generate new creative outputs, forming a new body of work unique to Abu Dhabi.</p><p>In addition, the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development has formed international partnerships to create cultural exchanges and develop events that benefit both countries. “Each year we work closely with two countries in an attempt to build greater cultural collaboration,"" Nahyan told TBY. “During 2017 we will nurture major international cultural partnerships with the UK and the Republic of India."" The British partnership, called “The Year of Creative Collaboration,"" will focus on the longstanding relationship between the two nations as manifested in the arts, literature, sports, and science. For India, the ministry is curating an exhibition of historic photographs and documents depicting the ties between the two closely linked countries in the hopes of forming a strong and durable bond for future collaboration. Far from being frivolous, projects such as these are central to the future of Abu Dhabi. Nahyan gets to the core of the issue when he states that “we need to know ourselves, we need to know other people and other cultures, and they need to know us.""</p><h4>SPORTING LIFE</h4><p>Abu Dhabi has also been making a name for its growing sport offerings. The recently launched “Sport in Abu Dhabi"" campaign has worked to promote the Emirate's role in the global sports landscape, and a number of major events will be held in the city in the coming years thanks to infrastructure improvements and upgraded facilities. Abu Dhabi will host the quadrennial Asian Cup in 2019 and the Abu Dhabi Tour in 2017. The latter is noteworthy for being elevated to the Union Cycliste Internationale's highest certification only two years after its inception. The Abu Dhabi Golf Club has become the host of the HSCB Open and has achieved recognition as one of the best courses in the Middle East. Ed Edwards, Group General Manager of the Abu Dhabi Golf Group that the course has worked hard to provide quality experiences for locals and international travelers, and are now looking expand the game's profile in the region: “We want to be energizing and engaging to make golf interesting for a new generation that might not have played,"" Edwards told TBY. “We want to attract new people to visit that have not been to the club before… We want to strengthen our appeal to tourists both from the other Emirates, from the Gulf region and from the rest of the world."" </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/27fce166-e7d3-4ea8-af7e-42aa62c53042.jpg","","","","Abu Dhabi's tourism sector remained strong in an uncertain economic environment, and the TCA's many partnerships in promising markets have the sector well positioned for future growth.","","","the-more-the-merrier-uae-abu-dhabi-2017","1278","552ef2b0361618126878404e","55f2c44086b7b0127c11bea0","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The population increased to 2.6 million in 2015 with the number expected to double and reach nearly 5 million inhabitants by 2020. The growing number of people coming to live in Abu Dhabi is pushing not only demand higher, but also the quality of living standards. Accordingly, those in the housing sector are having to be more sensitive to features such as incorporating sustainable energies, community development areas, and greater connectivity.</p><p>To face this demand, in 2013 the Abu Dhabi General Services Company (Musanada) set in motion a plan to develop the Emirati Neighborhood, an AED2.4 billion project that will extend over an area of 14.4 million sqm and is expected to facilitate residential units for approximately 370,000 UAE nationals. The project is one of the most ambitious housing initiatives in the history of Abu Dhabi and is meant to set a new vision of what the future of the accommodation market will look like in the Emirate.</p><p>The project looks to innovate in the real estate sector by offering spacious housing at low-density rates, as population within the compound will be controlled to maintain the living standards promised in the initial mockup. This program is a beacon within Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 as it reflects the plan's biggest attempt to provide affordable and sustainable housing for thousands of Emiratis.</p><p>The project's master plan is spread across five packages out of which two have already been completed; these entailed the development of roads, infrastructure works, improving the soil over which the project will stand, sewerage irrigation, firefighting systems, and a preservation plan for the environment around Emirati Neighborhood. Phase I consisted of distributing over 2,000 residential plots among UAE nationals.</p><p>Once it reaches completion, the project will be made up of 2,755 residential plots, 37 mosques, 47 gardens, and 13 schools serving all education levels. Much as its predecessor Khalifa City did, Emirati Neighborhood builds upon the concept of a city within a city. It will allocate the facilities needed for its inhabitants according to the needs and number of inhabitants in the compound. Most importantly, the project also contains carefully devised plans for the expansion of its boundaries as and when the community's population expands after the Emirati Neighborhood is delivered in 2019. </p><p>Emirati Neighborhood is located in a strategic location lying between Mohammed Bin Zayed City, Khalifa City A, and Khalifa City B, all within a short distance from Abu Dhabi International Airport. The final plan for the project is to integrate an educational hub and to house international think tanks within the city, as Emirati Neighborhood is also expected to become the epicenter for an economic flux in the region and in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.</p><p>During the last budget reunion of the Executive Council in 2016, an additional budget of AED664 million to develop a 50km road to link the Madinat Zayed and the Al Mafra areas was approved. The Executive Council also awarded three contracts for the final stages of Emirati Neighborhood, which includes a 45-month project to develop roads and two packages consisting of AED108.9 million and AED89 million for two different parts of the project. These actions were taken as a token of the country's leadership commitment to the project deadline as Emirati Neighborhood received the lion's share of the totality of the AED17 billion approved for projects that year.<br></p><p>With the utility and infrastructure plans done, the construction of the actual houses began in mid-2016. The progress on Emirati Neighborhood has also caught the attention of other nations in the region as it has set to become a new vision for housing in countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EMIRATI NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECT","welcome-to-the-neighborhood","1247","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AED4 billion development will be one of the largest, most comprehensive medical facilities the region has ever seen. Set to open in 3Q2017, Sheikh Shakbout Medical City is a 300,000sqm complex located in the Al Mafraq area of Abu Dhabi. It boasts an impressive 700 beds, over 2,200 staff, four towers, and two helipads. It will specialize in advanced burn treatment, orthopedic and thoracic surgery, and cardiac services, in addition to offering a wide range of state-of-the-art medical services. Sheikh Shakbout Medical City will be a joint effort by Abu Dhabi General Services (Musanada) in collaboration with Abu Dhabi Health Services (SEHA) and establish Abu Dhabi's position as a hub for medical tourism in the region.</p><p>Becoming the top destination for medical tourism is a primary goal for the Executive Council. Total expenditure on health are planned to jump from AED84 billion to 101 billion by 2021, as part of a plan that has unofficially referred to as UAE Medical Tourism Vision 2021. According to Dr. Amin Hussain Al Amiri, Assistant Undersecretary for Medical Practice and Licensing Sector at the Ministry of Health, “In 2000 we had only three hospitals with international JCI accreditation; in 2016 we have 55 hospitals throughout the country with this internationally recognized accreditation."" The Health Regulation Department is preparing for a massive inflow of medical tourists, estimating that Dubai alone will receive 500,000 by 2020. Having the top international standards of healthcare is crucial for attracting patients from abroad. UAE pharmacies and hospitals are also offering a large number of US Food and Drug Administration patented medicines to ensure only the highest quality medicine is given to patients. </p><p>The scope and vision of Sheikh Shakbout Medical City is a result of the direction of HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, who is known for his enduring effort and unyielding pursuit of excellence in his endeavors. His ambition to turn Abu Dhabi into one of the premier locations for healthcare in the world has eased the path for comprehensive projects across the Emirate. Sheikh Shakbout Medical City means that failure or anything less than extraordinary success is not an option.</p><p>Part of the effort to ensure the success of Sheikh Shakbout Medical City is to attract the most talented physicians, specialists, and healthcare providers from around the world. Recruiting the best to facilitate knowledge transfers between locals and expatriates has been foundational for the UAE's development strategy. In every sector from ICT to energy to defense and aerospace, the mix between Emiratis and expatriates is intended to lend expertise to the industry and assist in its development in the hopes of becoming a regional and world leader in each respective field.</p><p>Sheikh Shakbout Medical City will be in line with Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, a set of guidelines and objectives to make the Emirate a diversified, eco-friendly, and international business environment. A major aspect of this is making the facility easily accessible to people from anywhere from Nigeria to Indonesia to the UK. SEHA is doing this by making this facility highly centralized and integrating functions such as registration, insurance information, and a vendor manual into an online platform. There will also be a portal to provide accommodation for medical tourists and their families.</p><p>The image and positioning of Abu Dhabi in the coming future will be parallel to mega projects such as Sheikh Shakbout Medical City, in that its success will promote a message of quality and high standards around the world. In creating one of the biggest and most sought after medical facilities in the world, Abu Dhabi has cemented itself as a global destination for healthcare.  </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The development of Sheikh Shakbout Medical City is indicative of Abu Dhabi's pursuit of excellence in the services it offers its citizens and the wider world.","","Sheikh Shakbout Medical City","a-center-of-excellence","1622","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5583f87986b7b00e186be189","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new Maqta Gateway, which became operational in 2016, offers a one-stop shop for ports, exports, imports, containers, shipping lines, customs, regulating bodies, and government agencies. Details of all of the above are available in real time at any time of the day. This is one of the basic infrastructure requirements of a Port Community System (PCS), whereby easy exchange of information optimizes management by enabling the automation of port logistics. The launch of the Maqta Gateway marked the first PCS in the GCC, heralding the beginning of a new era of logistics and trade in the Gulf.</p><p>Stage 1 was completed in 2016 and is specific to shipping lines and shipping agents handling container cargo. It allows international companies to track shipments through the port and read vessel schedules. The CEO of Abu Dhabi Ports, developer and manager of all of Abu Dhabi's ports, Capt. Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, said, “Maqta Gateway will play a prominent role in facilitating the growing import and export activities, positioning Abu Dhabi as a major business hub in the region.“ He believes that rather than simply voicing a commitment to the Emirate's vision for the future, visions require action and to, “constantly innovate and employ new technologies to become key enablers of diversification by streamlining maritime trade.“<br>Maqta Gateway has already begun deploying the latest technologies in modern logistic services by launching its own digital Vessel Management System (VMS) to offer customers complete automation of vessel management processes and services on a single platform. Some of the services offered by the VMS are vessel registration, voyage declaration, vessel call requests, port clearance, marine services, and berth shifting. In addition, vessels can exchange unified digital information with the entire port community before arriving, expediting the required formalities and streamlining the entire process.</p><p>In early 2017, Maqta Gateway obtained an ISO 9001:2015 certification from the International Organization for Standardization, a Geneva- based organization that promotes proprietary, industrial, and commercial standards. In its year of operation, Maqta Gateway has provided recognized world-class services for facilitating global maritime trade along with products and services that meet international regulatory requirements. This represents a huge step for Abu Dhabi, and proves that it is on the right path to becoming both a regional and international trading hub for large-scale shipping.</p><p>The General Manager of Maqta Gateway is Dr. Noura Al Dhaheri, who leads the implementation and management of Abu Dhabi Ports' digital vision at Maqta. A Young Future Energy Leader, she graduated with a PhD in Interdisciplinary Engineering with a special application in Seaport Operations. Dr. Al Dhaheri's background makes her the right person at the helm for an operation like Maqta Gateway. Dr. Al Dhaheri is bridging the gap between one of the oldest mainstays of civilization—sea trade—and one of its most recent—digitalized systems and communication—as she told the press on the opening of the gateway: “The system is user friendly and will significantly improve operational efficiencies and create transparencies between all port users.“</p><p>Maqta Gateway seeks to integrate sea trade with technological communication platforms to create an evolutionary port of trade linking South Asia, Africa, East Asia, and Europe.

A staple in the National Innovation Strategy and the nation's 2021 Plan, the implementation of a creativity-based curricula at earlier stages in the education system is one of the newest initiatives from the UAEs leadership to foster entrepreneurship among its youth.</p><p>It is no surprise that turning the UAE into a haven of innovation and entrepreneurship is one of the national targets for the road ahead. The country ranks 19th on the Global and Entrepreneurship and Development Index, 17th on the Global Competitiveness Report, and leads the way in easiness to set up businesses in the GCC. Moreover, the UAE has built a solid basis of institutions backing up the ideals of a growing number of young entrepreneurs through financing, mentorship, and capacity building. For example, the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development, Dubai SME, the Emirates Foundation for Youth Development, or Impact Hub are just a handful of names pumping blood into start-ups throughout the Emirates. The country's large investments in technology and e-commerce, as well the leadership's goal to turn their institutions into full e-government bodies, have created one of the most innovation-friendly places in the world today. But most importantly, the equation for a successful ecosystem is now receiving impetus at the early stages through the promotion of entrepreneurial activities from the school years. By the time the National Innovation Strategy and the nation's 2021 Plan was launched entities such as Stanford University and Google had been dragged into the UAE's innovative approach toward cultivating young talent.</p><p>Students from grades 10 onward will now receive an education in subjects related to business, technology, and entrepreneurship as part of the recently approved reforms. At the higher education level, universities across the UAE have also embarked on promoting innovation and fostering entrepreneurial mind-sets among their students. Examples include NYU Abu Dhabi, which included a pre-professional area in leadership and social entrepreneurship with at least seven different options of courses for students to choose before enrolling in a full-time program; Abu Dhabi University through the inclusion of a local Cisco Entrepreneur Institute in its campus; Khalifa University through its own Khalifa Innovation Centre investing in entrepreneurial projects designed by their own students; and Zayed University through its Entrepreneurship Carnival and demonstrated commitment shown by the local educational sector to promote entrepreneurship among their students.<br>There are also challenges to overcome before the UAE start-up ecosystem can play at its full potential. The ever-present ghost of financial shortage and the prevailing stigma over self-employed professionals remain two of the main problems to tackle in the years to come. A realistic approach to start-up success rate is also part of the doubtful nature that deters not only financial institutions from funding start-ups, but also entrepreneurs from venturing in and pitching their ideas to funders, mentors, or accelerators. As HE Abdullah Saeed Al Darmaki, CEO of Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development, points out, “Entrepreneurs need to fail, maybe repeatedly, before they can rise to the top. The cultural challenge is to acknowledge that failure is always a good indication of how hungry or determined an individual can be to succeed the second time.“ In the end, it is an inherent part of the entrepreneur to find a way to go around those challenges and excel in their fields.<br>Innovation is the roadmap the UAE has embraced for its future development. The core values stated in UAE 2021 Plan and Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 stipulate that entrepreneurship is key to bring the younger spheres of the population on board to the economic future of the nation. With the start-up ecosystem continuously flourishing, it is a safe to state this will become a reality. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","STARTUP ECOSYSTEM","from-the-bottom-up-uae-abu-dhabi-2017","1334","552ef2b0361618126878404e","59ba6e8486b7b022d4765a90","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A strong reforming push undertaken in the early part of the 2000s is beginning to bear fruit, and core measures of education have been improving significantly. Literacy in the Emirate now stands at 92.8%, the primary enrollment rate is 81%, and the student-to-teacher ratio sits at 14.9. According to the most recently available statistics from the Statistical Center of Abu Dhabi (SCAD), the Emirate has 444 schools, of which 188 are private and 256 are government operated. The Emirate boasts 16,004 classrooms populated by 351,501 students and 23,571 teachers. The net enrollment rate for private schools stood at roughly 64%, while government schools accounted for around 36%. Primary and secondary levels accounted for 43.4% of total enrollment, and progression to secondary school has improved 4.6% from the previous year.</p><p>Education in Abu Dhabi is broken into three main categories by the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC): public schools, private schools, and higher education. ADEC is responsible for the administration of all public schools in the Emirate. Part of ADEC's mission has been to close small and underperforming schools and build new, more advanced schools. The program has already witnessed the merger of 40 preexisting schools, the opening of 23 new facilities, and 30 renovations or relocations. The Emirate's most recent 10-year strategic plan calls for raising standards across the board, developing educators and honing teaching skills, improving staff to student ratios.</p><p>Private education is also an important component of Abu Dhabi's educational mix, and the ADEC estimates that the sector is growing 5% per year. PPPs have begun to play an increasingly important role in Abu Dhabi's education sector. Beginning in 2006 with a pilot program that included 30 kindergartens and primary schools, the partnerships have sought to outsource educational and administrative responsibilities to private contractors. These partnerships have succeeded in improving the quality of education and producing quantifiable and scalable outcomes. The program has grown sizably from the original 30 schools, and currently 176 schools participate, according to the ADEC.</p><p>Tertiary education has been the real standout in terms of development, though, and the Emirate has boosted the percentage of its population with university degrees from 14.2 in 2011 to 21.9% in 2014. According to SCAD's most recently available statistics, 10,921 students graduated from institutions of higher education, of whom 47% graduated from government schools and 53% from private universities. Additionally, almost 51,000 students are enrolled in higher education programs in the Emirate, 37,292 of them citizens. R&amp;D has been a major emphasis for leaders in the education sector, and many local universities have expanded while other internationally recognized institutions have established campuses. Khalifa University, Master Institute, New York University Abu Dhabi, and Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi have all opened and expanded campuses across the Emirate, bringing a new standard of education to Emiratis</p><p>While many university students prefer degrees in the humanities, educators and officials recognize the importance of hard science degrees for the continued prosperity of the Emirate, and they have been pushing students to consider studying these fields. Improvements have already been made in increasing the number of college graduates coming from the hard sciences, and, according to recent statistics, 34% of all university graduates come from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. ADEC has taken steps ensure that Emiratis receive the skills they need to positively contribute to the workforce, and critical thinking, communication, and creativity remain key components of the innovation curriculum.</p><p>ADEC has also taken important steps to ensure that students in the Emirate are being exposed to core competencies at a young age, and secondary education has become a key forum in their attempt to transform Abu Dhabi's economy in to a knowledge-based one. Science, entrepreneurship, and innovation skills have become important parts of the secondary education landscape, and ADEC officials are working to ensure that the stage is set to propel more and more students into STEM fields at the university level. Eight distinct initiatives focusing on separate aspects of the educational process have been implemented. These programs—Innovation Centers, Programming Life Skills, “Our Scientists"" Contest, Abu Dhabi Innovates, Innovation Clubs, Innovation Ambassador, Innovation Standards, and Innovation Leaders—promote scientific thinking, research, and mentorship.</p><p>Developing its human capital remains a core focus for officials across the Emirate, and officials have been developing strategies to align educational outcomes with the requirements of the economy. By emphasizing improved skills and work-place functionality, the Emirate plans on creating and sustaining a knowledge economy that can lead Abu Dhabi into the future. According to the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development, the number of managers per thousand employees has increased steadily in recent years, rising from 36 in 2011 to 52 in 2014, growth driven by a strong focus on workplace skills education. Work remains to be done, however, and employment figures remain less then stellar in some places due to educational missteps. According to the 2016 Abu Dhabi Competitiveness Report, Abu Dhabi's youth comprise 37% of its unemployed population despite accounting for only 16% of its total population, and the main culprit for this is a lack of alignment between graduates' specialization and market requirements. This mismatch is a key issue for Abu Dhabi and scalable pilot programs aimed at addressing it have been unveiled at a number of schools. In terms of mismatched statistics, college educated women are another notable category. Though 60% of students enrolled at tertiary education institutions are women, women represent only 14% of the workforce in Abu Dhabi. These statistics are, however, sizably skewed by the large percentage of men working in sectors related to construction and infrastructure; when one assesses the refined labor force, women represent nearly 45% of the workforce. Additionally, efforts to recruit females into STEM fields have been notably successful, and nearly 35% of tech entrepreneurs in the region are female compared to 10% globally.</p><p>As Abu Dhabi continues to work toward its Vision 2030 goals, education will continue to be a major part of that vision. Stakeholders across the Emirate are impressed with the improvements that have been made so far, but they recognize that complacency is the enemy of progress. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/4ae08318-b3f3-4207-995c-f2270fd6e0c5.jpg","","","","As Abu Dhabi develops its higher education sector, it has taken concrete steps to ensure that its institutions are world class.","","","creating-the-future-through-education","1585","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5583f81d86b7b00e186be187","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although an overall slower rate of growth than previous years, certain segments were expected to increase faster than usual. The IT services sector was predicted to shoot up 9%, while software and telecommunications were set to increase 6% and 2%, respectively.</p><p>The number of active mobile subscriptions in the UAE has continued to grow, reaching about 18 million by the end of 2015 with a penetration rate of 209.8%, one of the highest rates in the world.<br>The year 2017 is believed to be a growth year in general, with spending on ICT in the entire MENA region expected to reach approximately USD250 billion next year, and increase nearly 4% YoY. Abu Dhabi will benefit from spillover around the Gulf, and will certainly receive a cut of the USD6.2 billion that will be generated in the UAE. Cloud computing, big data analytics, innovation accelerators, security, and smart city initiatives are all at the top Abu Dhabi's IT and telecoms investment landscape</p><p>Abu Dhabi's main telecommunications provider, Etisalat, continues to dominate the local sector with popular internet and mobile services. However, as the IT and telecoms sector expands horizontally, space technology and media companies have stepped into the forefront with a focus on developing local initiatives that appeal to the country's youth and pave the way for the future of the industry.</p><h4>CALL ME, MAYBE</h4><p>According to the latest figures released by Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), the average revenue per user for mobile services in the UAE reached AED112 per month, with average monthly call volumes of 151 minutes. Meanwhile, fixed lines, or landline services, reached revenues of AED102 per month and accounted for an average of 126 minutes of calls per line per month.</p><p>The year 2016 saw growth of more than 30% in terms of internet services in Abu Dhabi, where the average monthly revenue reached AED416 per user. Across the UAE, total internet revenues soared to nearly AED6 billion and the number of internet subscribers increased by 13%. Abu Dhabi mobile subscribers added to the UAE total of 15 million, while the number of post-paid subscribers reached almost 3 million.</p><p>Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, Etisalat made headlines in early 2017 after it was recognized as the most valuable telecoms brand in the Middle East, as measured by London-based brand valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance. Etisalat boasts ownership stakes in companies around the globe, including Mobily in Saudi Arabia, PTCL and Ufone in Pakistan, and Maroc Telecom and Moov in Africa. With a total corporate portfolio value of approximately USD8 billion, Etisalat is a comfortable USD1.5 billion ahead of Saudi Telecom Company (STC), which came in second place.</p><p>Etisalat also improved from a AA- rating in 2016 to AA+ for 2017, increasing its overall brand value by 45% YoY. The success comes on the heels of an aggressive campaign to increase brand awareness through global sponsorships for organizations as large as FC Barcelona.</p><p>The company's next mission is to carry Abu Dhabi into the future with the early adoption of 5G networks. Etisalat will start testing the technology in 2018 and launch commercially in 2019, according to Gulf News. Although not predicted to take off until 2020 or later, readiness for 5G technology will be a challenge for companies that are not already taking steps to reach it. In line with a penchant for being a leader in the region, Etisalat is planning to invest in a variety of new technology and innovations.</p><h4><br>REAL NEWS</h4><p>As mobile penetration continues to skyrocket, media regulators and publishers in the Emirate have taken steps to align themselves with recent trends. Digital content is already widely consumed in the form of news media, streaming services, e-books, and web radio. Now, the Emirate is adjusting its regulations to better suit the needs of the local population and ensuring that local content is promoted along with imported media.<br>“We saw a necessity to take a look at our regulation, look at our licensing procedures, at our content, and revamp them in order to cope with the reality of the market,“ Mansour Al Mansoori, Director General of the National Media Council of Abu Dhabi, told TBY, adding, “We have become much more robust and up-to-date, and we benchmark ourselves with international entities related to our sector.“ One of the key ways the National Media Council has improved the media available in the country is by placing more focus on making Arabic content available digitally. However, the vast majority of its work is ensuring that content that does enter the Emirate has been reviewed, licensed, and distributed properly. “We are now fully invested in providing our online services to the best international standards and we are working on legislation to regulate online and digital media to the highest standard. Our objective is to ensure that the legislative environment for the media sector in its entirety in the UAE is on par with the best anywhere in the world, “ Director General Mansoori concluded. As the National Media Council, the regulator is also working to ensure that the state news agency offers creative and appealing content that will appeal to youth and engage with its readers. By doing so, the entity hopes it can play a critical role in promoting the government's agenda and ambitious plans for the future. In raising awareness about the work the authorities are doing to improve not only the Emirate, but also the UAE at large, the National Media Council can facilitate growth and inspire the next generation of young Emiratis.</p><p>While the National Media Council regulates, licenses, and distributes content, twofour54 creates it. The company considers itself “the home of quality creation,“ with content across all platforms, but especially in digital media. To that end, the company also places special emphasis on Arabic content that can be used to educate and empower young people in Abu Dhabi. “There are new opportunities and untapped markets and we want to facilitate those opportunities for Abu Dhabi's media industry. We want to focus on digital, gaming, apps and on the platforms we use to promote the work being done by the industry here,“ Maryam Eid Al Mheiri, CEO of twofour54, told TBY. The company employs over 600 freelance content creators from over 430 companies. <br>Parallel to its objective to increase the amount of quality local content in Abu Dhabi, twofour54 is striving to engage the region's youth in the industry as a career choice. By focusing not only on how youth consume content, but also involving them in the process and demonstrating the value of the industry, the company seeks to contribute to diversifying the economy and bettering society at large. As of 2017, the company has successfully support 18 entrepreneurs in the execution of media projects.</p><h4>IS IT SECRET? IS IT SAFE?</h4><p>While mobile operators and media companies increasingly shift their gaze to technology and innovation, more data is sent to be stored digitally. Thus digital security companies have the opportunity to carve out a highly specialized niche in Abu Dhabi to support firms across many sectors as they seek to protect their company and customers' privacy. However, IT companies that choose Abu Dhabi as a starting point have access to an even broader GCC market. </p><p>Founded in Abu Dhabi, DarkMatter is one of the first UAE-based cyber security companies that has made the leap into global expansion. “Our ultimate goal is not to serve the UAE market alone, but to go global and compete with the titans operating in the US, France, and the UK. We aim at becoming a global service provider with the UAE brand in its blood,“ Faisal Al Bannai, CEO of DarkMatter, said.</p><p>The company has also expanded its services through R&amp;D centers in Canada, China, and Finland, mapping out different talent pools that are willing to enter the industry and join 400 other employees through its headquarters in Abu Dhabi. “We want to capitalize on this talent to foster a knowledge transfer culture whereby the industry makes the most of potential opportunities,“ Al Bannai concluded.</p><h4>ANOTHER DIMENSION</h4><p>Being present in Abu Dhabi, expanding to other Emirates in the UAE, and establishing a presence in the region is not enough for some companies in Abu Dhabi. In fact, for the UAE Space Agency, the planet is just a stepping stone for true progress.</p><p>Established in 2014, the UAE Space Agency began as an instrumental part of the national plan for the development of the country's space industry. “We started with a proposal for a national space policy by putting different documents together and we launched the first space policy in the Middle East,“ HE Dr. Eng. Mohammed Nasser Al Ahbabi, Director General of the UAE Space Agency, told TBY. Through this policy, the agency has managed to make an impact on multiple sectors such as education, business, and the government itself. With huge emphasis on R&amp;D culture, the agency is open to partnering with universities and any institution interested in eveloping space technology. Its research centers at the UAE University in Al Ain and the Masdar Institute serve as tools to attract new hires and generate ideas for projects such as building and launching satellites. </p><p>The capstone project of the agency is the Hope Mission to Mars 2021. “This mission will help us understand more about Mars and educate international organizations on how to better protect Earth,“ Dr. Nasser Al Ahbabi continued. “We want to make sure our planet does not suffer the same fate as Mars—a dry and cold planet with no water.“ Through tackling some of the world's most daunting challenges, Abu Dhabi is setting an example in the UAE and the GCC. Through programs such as Hope Mission, anyone from an IT expert to a science student can look forward to a career in Abu Dhabi making contributions that could change the world. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/884d79e6-4a7f-414e-9158-398a405a5967.jpg","","","","","","","earth-to-mars","1253","552ef2b0361618126878404e","59ba6e8486b7b022d4765a90","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Officials in the public and private sector have renewed their commitment to developing every aspect of the Emirate's health sector. According to the World Health Organization, per-capita health expenditure is over USD2,400, putting the UAE amongst the top-20 countries in the world in terms of healthcare expenditure. Life expectancy is 76 for males and 79 for females, and spending on health sits at around 3.6% of GDP.</p><p>Increases in wealth and the proliferation of sedentary lifestyles have led to the exacerbation of certain chronic illnesses. Rates of obesity, type-II diabetes, and cardio-vascular disease have all risen in recent years, and health officials have articulated growing concern about the long-term health implications of unhealthy lifestyles. According to the WHO, heart disease is the number-one cause of death in the Emirates, while stroke and diabetes are other leading culprits. In a recent interview with TBY, Sarah Stall, Chief Administrative Officer of Healthpoint, described the issue in stark terms, noting there is a “growing obesity epidemic and an exponential increase in type-II diabetes."" The issue has not, however, gone without response, and public and private organizations have been taking major steps in an effort to address the issues. Stall observed that Healthpoint had recently partnered with Imperial College London Diabetes Centre (ICLDC) and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi to expand services and raise awareness. “Healthpoint also leads many other events in the community, creating awareness and educating the public on health issues that are relevant and have an impact on the people of the UAE,"" said Stall.</p><p>A growing population and industry expansion ensure that Abu Dhabi's health needs will necessitate the training of large number of new doctors and nurses in the coming years. According to projections from the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi (HAAD), Abu Dhabi will need 4,800 new doctors and 13,000 new nurses by the end of 2022. Additionally, the WHO reports that the Emirates are lagging behind other Gulf states in terms of nurses and midwifes, totaling only 31 per 100,000 people compared to 45 in Kuwait, 48 in Saudi Arabia, and 53 in Oman. The vast majority of nursing professionals are foreigners, and according to the US-UAE Business Council, only 1.6% of the nurses at the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA), a leading medical care provider that owns and operates all public medical facilities in Abu Dhabi, are Emirati. This shortage is expected to provide serious opportunities for both new generations of Emiratis interested in healthcare as well as educational institutions focused on vocational training in the medical field. Shortages have also been identified in psychiatry, intensive and critical care medicine, emergency care, neonatology, pediatrics, oncology, and orthopedics.</p><p>HAAD is the governmental body that oversees the Emirate's health services, and the authority has been working to improve outcomes in a number of key areas. Since 2014, Abu Dhabi has been following a strategy outlined by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince, that seeks to improve health outcomes across a number of areas. The plan includes 85 distinct initiatives to, among other things, increase the overall quality of the system, improve safety and patient satisfaction, recruit high-quality medical personnel, and develop and world-class data systems into the healthcare industry. A core piece of this project has included developing and expanding SEHA, and the company now operates 12 hospitals, 46 primary healthcare clinics, 10 disease prevention and screening centers, three mobile clinics, four dental care centers, and a handful of other important medical facilities, according to the US-UAE Business Council. SEHA has been working to expand its medical facilities across the country, and notable projects have included a sizable enlargement of the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, which included the addition of a psychiatry center and pediatric and adult dialysis centers, and the construction of the Al Towayya Children's Specialty Center in Al Ain. Another key component in SEHA's mission has been the development of its Ambulatory Health Services (AHS) facilities, which now include 38 centers across the Emirate. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Dr. Mariam Buti Al Mazrouei, CEO of AHS, described the service's mission and its successes. “AHS has maintained its goal of being the gateway for healthcare services in Abu Dhabi,"" said Al Mazrouei. “Since our inception, our target has been to enhance access to care and offer quality curative and preventative care for patients, as well as sub-specialty services in our healthcare centers."" This emphasis has brought a new level of care to the farther flung corners of the Emirate, and their work continues to improve the health of Emiratis. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/87ddecb8-843d-4587-9a99-ce34f2fe19de.jpg","","","","As Abu Dhabi continues to expand the quality of its healthcare facilities and services, its outcomes have improved and it has cemented its status as a leading destination for medical tourism in the MENA region.","","","committed-to-health","1599","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5583f87986b7b00e186be189","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also the place where one of the most promising and innovative components of Abu Dhabi's industrial development is taking place. Here, at the entrance to the Garden City and birthplace to the country's founder, the aerospace industry has taken off.</p><p>One of the pillars of Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, the aerospace industry has been rapidly placed in pole position as part of the Emirate's drive for high-tech industries. The crowning jewel of this plan is Nibras Aeropace Park, an area dedicated to the development of an aerospace industry born as a joint initiative between Mubadala and Abu Dhabi Airports Company. A project that was set in motion in 2012, Nibras is a world-class aerospace center dedicated to the manufacturing and maintenance of aerostructures and original equipment manufacturers for local and international aerospace companies. </p><p>Once it reaches completion, Nibras will become a fully fledged hub with education and training institutions within its facilities. It will house a pilot training school, aerospace-related industrial projects, business and office facilities, and mixed-use residential zones with top-notch community services and amenities. Furthermore, Nibras anticipates future status as a pole of attraction for SMEs and large corporations as the cluster becomes a research and development center for the entire Middle East.</p><p>With 85% of Phase I completed and with Phase II to be triggered over the course of the next three years, Nibras has become a catalyst for Abu Dhabi's economic diversification. It has reduced production costs and leveraged the competitive advantage of the local industry in Al Ain and Abu Dhabi. Most importantly, Nibras has opened the door to a technologically advanced labor market, with a growing number of women attracted to this sector.<br>To date, 65% of the total space available in the cluster has already been occupied by a number of globally recognized aerospace companies. Tenants include Strata, a local aerostructure manufacturing company that has signed partnerships with the global leading manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing, AMMROC, and Piaggio Aerospace amongst others.</p><p>As for the partnerships signed along the expansion of Nibras, the multi-year contract signed in 2013 between Mubadala and Boeing has been a high point. The agreement is for the supply of USD2.5 billion in advanced composites and aerostructures for the multinational's commercial programs. This agreement has served as an anchor for the American giant and has encouraged other aerospace producers to follow suit. In 2015, the cluster reached a new milestone by acquiring the rights for the 18-month internship program between Boeing and Mubadala, which will provide aerospace engineering expertise to bolster the UAEs industrial capabilities. In 2016, 10 Emirati students made up the first batch of graduates for the joint program and another 10 locals are expected to join in 2017.</p><p>Mubadala's Strata, the leading aerospace manufacturing company in the UAE, was also awarded two contracts with Airbus worth over USD1 billion for the assembly of the Horizontal Tail Plane for the A320 and the Inboard Flaps for the A350-900 aircraft. The leading development company of Abu Dhabi also secured an agreement with Rolls-Royce to build an engine maintenance center and to manufacture the company's Trent XWB engines—used to power Airbus A350—in Nirbas Park, which is expected to be finished in 2021.</p><p>In late 2016, DHL Global Forwarding also initiated a strategic partnership with Mubadala to streamline the logistics process from Nibras and its tenant companies. The five-year partnership is expected to reduce airfreight costs and improve logistics connectivity among the aerospace manufacturing companies based in Nibras. </p><p>With the board set for the aerospace industry to become one of the UAEs future leading industries, Nibras Aerospace Park is attracting the eyes of the world to one of the most ambitious projects to have been carried out in Abu Dhabi to date. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NIBRAS AEROSPACE PARK","ready-for-take-off-uae-abu-dhabi-2017","1219","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58d2244186b7b029482eb779","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet the lack of explosive growth doesn't spell doom for the Abu Dhabi economy. Experienced industry participants know that the market operates in cycles, and, in interviews with TBY, a common refrain was the necessity during a slow year to bring prices down to earth and give the market a chance to readjust. Thanks to a forward-looking government and a reputation as one of the GCC's real-estate hotspots, firms plan to continue working to develop Abu Dhabi for the years to come</p><h4>REAL ESTATE</h4><p>Abu Dhabi faces a number of challenges unique to the UAE. The fall in oil prices hit Abu Dhabi hard and created spillover effects in the real estate market. Abu Dhabi's GDP fell by 4.5% in 2016, and the real estate sector saw prices fall across the board. The residential real estate sector was perhaps the hardest hit, with research firm JLL reporting that average rents fell by 5% from 2016. Villa and apartment sales showed the largest decline, with prices falling 11% from the year before, but the damage was hardly limited to any one segment of the market: apartment rentals fell by 7% and villa rentals fell by 4%. After residential prices grew by 25% in 2013, the current downturn probably served to bring prices back down to more sustainable levels. As such, industry participants see the current conditions as an expected and perhaps needed cycle, and note that the current downturn has allowed for the refiguring needed for a more stable long-term sector.</p><p>The fall in oil revenues has resulted in increased demand for cheaper housing as the Abu Dhabi population adjusts to lower income levels. Participants in the Abu Dhabi real estate sector have recognized the potential of this new sector and have begun to offer new units targeting these middle- and low-income groups. Many participants see this as a positive sign, citing the traditional lack of good low-income housing options in Abu Dhabi and noting that this could lay the foundation for a more stable crop of affordable housing in the future. Chris Taylor, CEO of Abu Dhabi Finance (ADF), said as much in an interview with TBY. “Ownership has now been made available for lower-income people,"" Taylor told TBY, “and this is very healthy for the market. The chances for developers to make money amid lower prices will also push them to offer better services, to raise their standards, and to push for a more effective sector.""</p><p>Similar trends were at play in Abu Dhabi's office sector, which saw average rents drop 5% YoY due to the oil sector's decline and a drop in public spending. Commercial lending leaders noted that the current trend in the industry was consolidation and increased efficiency of space, with demand for subdivided and affordable units far outpacing demand for luxury office complexes. Despite the flagging demand, which is expected to persist through 2017, the office retail market remains fairly strong due to the lack of new units appearing on the market. JLL projects that some 211,000sqm of office space will arrive on the market in 2017. The limited amount of space available should help keep rents from bottoming out while the oil market continues to slow. <br>Likewise, Abu Dhabi's retail market remained stable in 2016. No major arrivals came to market, and rents remained stable. A few minor projects are expected to add about 85,000sqm of retail space in 2017, but the Emirate's status as a destination shopping area is expected to keep demand strong in major malls despite job and spending cuts that will reduce discretionary income. Abu Dhabi's flagship retail project is the USD1 billion Al Marayah Central shopping mall, which is expected to provide a boost to the retail sector when it opens in 2018. Located on Al Maryah island, the project will be 2.8 million sqft upon completion. Developer Gulf Related has already leased about half that space, with an estimated 75% expected to be leased by the end of summer 2017. Retailers already committed to the site include Zara, Al Tyer, and Chalhoub.</p><p>What else could the future hold? Some industry participants believe that Abu Dhabi needs to emulate Dubai and create additional free zones. Currently, Dubai is home to 25 free zones, development sites that come with streamlined regulation and tax incentives in order to draw concentrated retail and commercial real estate. The lower operating costs and efficiencies of scale have made Dubai's free trade zones popular areas for retail clustering, and the positive effects of such zones have served as buffers against retail downturns. Foreign investment and private partnerships, while not as widespread in Abu Dhabi as in Dubai, are still cornerstones of the economy and an increase in these zones is one possibility for the future.</p><h4>CONSTRUCTION</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's construction sector has slowed considerably after the boom of recent years. The current projects in the sector reflect the demands for more affordable and low-budget housing and office space. Larger-scale infrastructure and flagship building contracts, in contrast, have slowed as public spending has dipped. As with real estate demand, developers regard this as a natural cycle for the market and are hardly concerned. Sami Sidawi, Chairman of Al Nasr Contracting Company, told TBY as much in a recent interview: “The market has been going through an interesting spiral of ups and downs and we see it as a matter of survival of the fittest. The most competitive companies have been able to overcome this period while others have perished in the process; at the end, this will generate a healthier market with only quality players operating in it. We believe that by end-2017 this restructuration process will finish and we will see a revamp in the market. I see a bright long-term future for the UAE.""</p><p>Nevertheless, there are significant projects underway. 2016 saw the Bloom Central and ADNOC HQ projects finish on Abu Dhabi island, and the arrival of Four Seasons and Marriott hotels, which added more than 500 rooms to the city's hotel supply. The Abu Dhabi government has also continued work on Plan 2030, an ambitious long-term blueprint for the development of a sustainable, well-managed Emirate. Launched in 2030, the plan consists of a set of guiding principles for the present and future needs of the Emirate that will help the city grow in a manageable and structured way. Part of the plan calls for the development of a new Madinat Zayed business district, and 2016 saw the government award a AED1 billion construction package for the development of the site. The project includes a host of infrastructure works to integrate the district into Abu Dhabi's public transportation system and link to the surrounding districts of Khalifa and Mohammed Bin Zayed. Upon completion, the new multi-use urban center is expected to house 300,000 people and be the workplace of an additional 300,000.</p><p>There are also a number of large-scale construction projects underway in the Emirate that were set in motion before the fall in oil prices. Several have come under delays in recent years due to the decrease in revenues, but their continuation and planned completion are expected in the next few years. Most of these projects are infrastructure upgrades, like the new Midfield Airport Terminal, a USD3.5 billion program that will double the airport's capacity to 30 million passengers a year upon its completion in early 2019. Abu Dhabi is also constructing Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, the first nuclear plant in the UAE. Eventually expected to supply a quarter of the UAE's electricity needs, the USD23 billion project will have four reactors when fully operational in 2020. As part of the infrastructure of the plant, Abu Dhabi is also constructing the USD1.5 billion E11 highway, which will connect the Emirate with the Saudi border. Plan 2030 includes more than infrastructure construction, though. Commercial developments such as the 36,000sqm community market project planned for Mohamed bin Zayed City and the USD440 million Rahayel City auto hub are examples of new construction sites that are designed to diversify the Abu Dhabi economy through new commercial options. </p><p>The long-term nature of these projects has given the construction industry confidence and purpose heading in to the future. Eng. Hamad Al Amer, Managing Director of Trojan Holding, summed up the general sentiment when he told TBY that “We are trying to align our company's vision with Abu Dhabi Vision 2030…. The recent downturn caused by sluggish commodity prices and a surplus of oil in the global market impacted every sector. Nevertheless, in 2017 we see prices going back to normal with a market recovery on the horizon."" </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/c22e4676-7019-48fb-9938-5356533f7c3e.jpg","","","","Abu Dhabi's real estate sector saw prices fall in 2016, but the government's long-term vision and the structural health of the industry have participants expecting big things in the future.","","","looking-to-the-future-uae-abu-dhabi-2017","1668","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Abu Dhabi Ministry of Transport highlighted the Emirate's massive potential in 2008 with the creation and development of a detailed transportation master plan and implementation program for the city of Abu Dhabi and the rest of the Emirate. Titled the “Abu Dhabi Surface Transport Master Plan"" (STMP), the project is today comprised of a comprehensive set of policies and plans for the transportation sector, incorporating everything from road infrastructure to sea and airport development. As part of the plan's mandate, the STMP features crossover with the Urban Structure Framework Plan of Abu Dhabi, created under the vision of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, which was designed as a long-term vision for 2030. Like the overarching framework plan that guides the Emirate's future vision, the STMP aims to establish a multi-integrated transport system of regional and metro rail, public bus transportation, and improved highways by 2030.</p><p>However, with 2015 and 2016 marred by low oil prices and slow speed of development, many of the transportation megaprojects have been either slow-moving, stalled, or completely on hold for the past two years or more. As oil prices show signs of recovery, 2017 signals the start of a new wave of growth for Abu Dhabi's transportation sector.</p><p>One segment of the transportation sector that has remained unaffected by the fluctuating hydrocarbon market is maritime transportation. Abu Dhabi Ports is a conglomerate that operates 11 ports around the Emirate, the largest and most impressive of which is Khalifa Port, a state-of-the-art deepwater project worth USD7.2 billion. Since it was completed in 2012, the port and the neighboring Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) have revolutionized not only Abu Dhabi's transportation sector, but also the economy as a whole. </p><h4>FROM THE DEEP</h4><p>With forecasters estimating that Abu Dhabi's ports could account for up to 15% of the Emirate's GDP by 2030, the marine transportation segment is a focal point for investment, business, and logistics companies. Abu Dhabi Ports reported that the country's ports already contribute more than 3% to non-oil GDP, a figure growing every year.</p><p>In an interview with TBY, Capt. Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Ports, explained, “2016 reflected a 152% increase in our net profit, 15% increase in revenue, our customs contribution raised up to 70%, and a 90% increase in our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA)."" The company handled 1.6 million TEUs in 2016, reaching a total of more than 5 million since operations at Khalifa Port began in 2012. It was also a record year for general cargo and bulk, with 17 million tons passing through one of the Emirate's ports over the course of the year. In terms of passenger numbers, Abu Dhabi's ports welcomed more than 260,000 cruise voyagers in 2016. </p><p>Construction continues on warehouses in Kizad, where 64 additional facilities are being established for a large client base. In an effort to attract a wider pool of customers, Abu Dhabi Ports is not only expanding its territory and warehousing options, but also signing major international agreements. Notably, the company is combining efforts with Chinese logistics giant COSCO, which announced in 2016 that it would take steps to make Khalifa Port its local hub in the region. The move is estimated to add approximately 3.6 million more TEUs per year to the port's operations. Additionally, Abu Dhabi Ports is prepared to accommodate up to 20 more logistics providers once developments in Kizad are complete, with 12 slated to arrive in 2017. “Khalifa Port is fairly new with just about four years of operations, but it has already stirred high demand,"" Capt. Juma Al Shamisi said. “We recently expanded it by 1km and are also deepening the channel and the basin from 16.5m to 18.5m to cater for the biggest ships trading the world today and the foreseeable future.""</p><p>Behind the scenes, Abu Dhabi Terminals (ADT) manages and operates Khalifa Port. 2016 proved to be a boom year for the company, which saw a notable improvement in the cost of logistics, transit times, and ease of doing business. “We have also been able to triple our business from 2010 to 2016, which reflects a positive impact from a local perspective. We have created a number of interesting jobs for the local labor market, we introduced state-of-the-art technologies, and have also hired a growing number of locals into our daily operations,"" Martijn Van den Linde, CEO of ADT, told TBY. The key exports from the hub were polymer steel, aluminum, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and copper. Commodities have driven growth on the export side in recent years, but local players like ADT see regional logistics as a way to add value to the economy. “Abu Dhabi is well positioned to play to its strengths, its industrial-oriented exports, and the lower rate of fast-moving trade you see in other GCC markets. Right now, the key for us is to find new markets and ways to differentiate ourselves to keep growing,"" Van den Linde concluded.</p><p>Recent expansions in November 2016 saw Kizad expand its capacity by 25%. As part of the expansions, new equipment at the port includes advanced ship-to-shore cranes, 10 shuttle carriers, and 10 additional automated stacking cranes. In 2017, the Khalifa Port will boast the capacity to handle 2.5 million TEUs per annum.</p><h4>FINAL DESTINATION</h4><p>Nearly 2 million passengers arrived in Abu Dhabi in February 2017, registering a 2.5% increase YoY. In particular, Terminal 3 at the airport registered over 26% growth in passenger traffic and a 29% increase in flight traffic over the same period. Passenger numbers from Saudi Arabia grew significantly by over 13%, largely due to the opening of new routes from Saudi Arabia-based Flynas. Saudi Arabia is currently the second-most popular destination for passenger traffic passing through Abu Dhabi International Airport. Meanwhile, incoming and outgoing UK passenger traffic grew 10%, attributed to the addition of a the third daily Etihad A380 flight that has boosted flight traffic between Abu Dhabi and London by over 21%. These figures are all set to increase with the opening of the Midfield Terminal in January 2019.</p><p>Originally scheduled to open in 2017, developers at the Midfield Terminal at Abu Dhabi International Airport announced in 2016 that the project would be delayed. However, according to recent media reports, progress is beginning to pick up once again, with work ongoing at the airport. Currently, Abu Dhabi International Airport can handle 62 aircraft at once. When the new terminal is opened, the airport will have 65 gates in total, with the capacity to handle over 141 planes simultaneously and supported by a cutting-edge technical systems and facilitated by Turkish airport operator TAV. The budget allocated for the Midfield Terminal has already exceeded AED19.1 billion, out of a potential AED38 billion set aside for the expansion and development of the entire aviation sector. The new terminal will also increase the airport's capacity to 45 million passengers per year. With six levels in total, the new terminal will include a hotel, extensive retail space, and dozens of restaurants upon completion.</p><h4>EXPRESS TRAIN</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's aviation development plans are not the only initiatives in the transportation sector that have faced serious setbacks. Plans for a region GCC network and an Abu Dhabi Metro are all but on hold since first being proposed in 2009 and 2010. However, local committees are focused on analyzing where the projects stand in order to set reasonable targets and get development back on track in time to meet the goals laid out in Vision 2030.</p><p>Currently, the deadline for the GCC rail network has been moved back three years to 2021, according to the Ministry of Infrastructure Development. Although the original target date of 2018 is no longer possible for the authorities, Abu Dhabi is committed to achieving its portion of the plan, regardless of how the other countries involved proceed, in large part due to the fact that the UAE seeks to have its own internal rail system in place by 2021.</p><p>Etihad Rail has been tasked with developing the AED40 billion, 1,200km network. The first stage, which included the first 266km of the line, has already been used to transport over 5 million tons of sulfur from Shah and Habshan to the port of Al Ruwais for Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) for export. The second stage comprises 628km of railway that will link Khalifa Port and Jebel Ali to the border with Saudi Arabia at Al Ghuwaifat and the border of Oman at Al Ain.</p><p>Within the Emirate itself, there are plans to implement 131km of metro and light rail lines. The plan, which was outlined in the STMP, stipulates a first phase of 18km between Zayed Sports City in the south of Abu Dhabi island and Mina Zayed to the north, 5km underground and 13km on the surface. However, the project has received limited funding since 2012, and development is on hold.</p><h4>AHEAD OF THE CURVE</h4><p>While Abu Dhabi Metro lines hang in limbo, other potential public transportation options have come into view. One of the most innovative designs to be considered is the Hyperloop system proposed to run from Abu Dhabi to Al Ain. In December 2016, the DOT announced that it had signed an agreement with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies to carry out feasibility studies for the project. At the same time, another feasibility study is already being conducted in partnership with the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai for a similar Hyperloop-type project that would connect Dubai and Abu Dhabi. With the possibility of traveling at speeds of up to 1,200km/h, the Hyperloop system is a passenger and freight transportation method that propels a pod-like vehicle through a near-vacuum tube at great speeds. With high-tech solutions appearing on the horizon and development of traditional public transportation at a standstill, Abu Dhabi could have the opportunity to be a pioneer in the region and world with the latest innovation. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/b048a097-181c-4ba0-b318-df1038300771.jpg","","","","While the economy accelerates back up to speed, the transportation sector is also moving faster and more efficiently to reach targets in 2021 and 2030.","","","set-the-pace","1354","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405b","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-14T06:48:00.000Z","2017-09-14T06:48:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Industrial Revolution","<p>As revenue from fossil fuels has become less and less reliable, the country's leadership has orchestrated a carefully planned pivot away from the energy economy, and key to this is the development of a strong and durable industrial sector. Industrial development has historically been the cornerstone of any emerging economy including fellow oil producers Malaysia and Mexico, and the UAE will be no exception. Thus, the rise of the Emirates as a global commerce hub hinges in part on the country's industrial plan and its ability to support the growth of small manufacturers into major players in the economy. </p><p>As detailed in the UAE's Vision 2021, and in Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030, there is a standing goal of reducing the contributions of oil and gas to 20% from its current level of 30%. More specifically, Abu Dhabi aims to elevate the share of its non-oil private sector to 40% of GDP by 2030, against the current level of 27%. This private-sector growth is most feasible in the manufacturing and industry sector. On this front, the Ministry of Economy expects to nearly double the manufacturing base of the UAE to 20% by 2021, and then raise it further to 25% by 2025. Within the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, however, the manufacturing base trails at around 5%, with the Department of Economic Development highlighting its intentions to double the sector to 10% in the long run. </p><p>Commenting on the drive for industrialization, Director General of Abu Dhabi's Industrial Development Bureau Ayman Al Makawi said, “The 2016-20 strategy will be all about enabling the private sector, about linking the larger industries with the smaller and medium-sized companies.“ Makawi is shrewd to put faith in the UAE's SME sector. Globally, SMEs fail at a rate of 80%, with only 20% of businesses surviving. However, the UAE's failure rate is far lower, with the success rate hovering between 25 and 30%. </p><p>With the support of several initiatives and agencies, the success rate for such enterprises may rise to as much as 50%, high above the international benchmark. Initiatives such as the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development and the National Programme for SMEs help to provide a framework for the SME sector to thrive, incentivize entrepreneurship, and offer technical support and training to businesses after they have launched, helping them to blossom into larger industrial entities. </p><p>Government support also comes from the National Industrial Coordination Council and the Industrial Development Bureau of Abu Dhabi, which seek to steer a bulk of the UAE's economic growth toward the industrial sector. One key achievement of these organizations has been a law allowing for 100% ownership of businesses in industry and manufacturing to foreign nationals, bolstering FDI in the sector.<br>These types of initiatives are critical, as industrial development is noted to be the most difficult area for SMEs to emerge. Entrepreneurship in manufacturing is relatively risky, requiring huge capital investments. However, it is also the sector that has the best opportunity for contributing to local growth. Manufacturing goods are more likely to use local resources, and are more likely to be exported compared to other sectors. Conversely, trade sectors bring in goods from foreign markets and move cash outside of the UAE. Because of this, manufacturing has a powerful multiplier effect; for every USD1 million of development in manufacturing, USD1.3 million is added to the economy.</p><p>To showcase the vision for industrialization and to facilitate the development of SMEs into major players in the manufacturing industry, the UAE hosted the Global Manufacturing and Industrialization Summit on March 30, 2017. The summit was a joint effort by the UAE Ministry of Economy and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). This was the first global gathering of manufacturing industry leaders and SMEs, and was hosted under the patronage of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The goal of the summit was to connect the industry's decision-makers, creating a forum for sharing best-practices in industrialization, while backing the local vision for technology and innovation in manufacturing.</p><p>The World Industrial Summit did more than launch a platform for collaboration between small and large industrial businesses. It was also a signal to the world that the Emirates will not settle for nominal diversification. Instead, it is positioned to propel itself to the forefront as a regional leader in industry, transforming a sector that had lagged behind for decades. Bringing the UAE's industry to the core of its economy is no small order. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INDUSTRIAL PLAN","industrial-revolution","1635","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The UAE is a palpably swift innovator and adopter across the technological spectrum, and aerospace looms large in the mix. As commodity prices flounder, cost-efficiency is the byword, whether for the civilian helicopter fleets of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), or the maintenance of the naval fleet, with commercial advances made more productive through international partnership and collaboration. And meanwhile, key international events such as the Abu Dhabi Global Aerospace Summit provide a perfect platform for long-term thinking.</p><h4>Uniform Effectiveness</h4><p>While the UAE is considered a safe haven for investment in a troubled region, its physical security is the preserve of the Union Defense Force, based in Abu Dhabi. National service, introduced in the UAE in 2014, is mandatory for Emirati men aged 18 to 30, while optional for women. The purchase of sophisticated hardware for land, air, and sea has led the nation to become the world's third-largest defense importer in 2015, all but doubling expenditure over the past decade, thus registering the same quantum leap observed in other economic sectors.</p><p>According to Global Security, the UAE's defense expenditure printed at USD23.5 billion in 2016, and seems set to rise at a CAGR of 6.59% to USD31.8 billion by 2021. This accumulates to defense capex of around USD140.8 billion, not least given its likely contribution to mitigating any escalation of regional tension. Vision 2021 also entails shoring up the domestic component of the defense sector. Defense spending peaked at roughly USD5.6 billion in 2005. The nation has tended toward diversifying its military procurement sources in the interests of economic cooperation with allied nations as is evident in its opting for F-16 combat aircraft from US as well as Mirage 2000 combat aircraft from France, while in 2016 penning a deal with UK-based aerospace and defense company BAE Systems to develop rapid response mobile artillery.</p><h4>Big Grey Corvette</h4><p>The UAE boasts a capable navy centered on the Baynunah Corvette Program numbering six ships, and one that is a faithful client to local enterprises. Dr. Khaled Al Mazrouei is the CEO of Abu Dhabi Ship Building (ADSB), the MENA region's foremost shipbuilder. He told TBY of the firm's new Abu Dhabi facility featuring a floating dock capable of dry-docking vessels of up to 10,000 tons and maximum length of 180m, dimensions that exceed anything else available in Abu Dhabi. It has also signed contracts worth USD272 million to build naval vessels. “We are currently working on our flagship (and above-mentioned) Baynunah program,"" which had delivered five of six 72-meter corvette class Baynunah vessels to the UAE Navy at time of interview. Foreign projects include landing craft and high-speed vessels for the Kuwait Ministry of Defense. ADSB has broadened its geographical footprint through its two wholly owned subsidiaries Frontiers and Safwa Marine, as well as generating revenue in diverse parts of the maritime ecosystem. While the former subsidiary caters to the combat systems and communication systems needs of the military, the latter operates in the civil arena, specifically, “the niche market of superyachts for commercial and technical management, repairs, and maintenance.""</p><h4>Human Capital: Solving a Perennial Dilemma</h4><p>Twinned with strategic investments across the aerospace and defense value-chain is the training of a skilled local workforce. The star graduates of today are even likely to work on projects that look beyond the earth as space technology, too, is not beyond the remit or capability of the nation as we will see later. The race to increase the local workforce in strategic industries is a serious one in the pursuit of self-sufficiency. Private sector enterprises such as maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) and OEM activities have traditionally attracted less interest than the more favored state-enterprises. But this is being addressed. Deputy CEO of Strata Manufacturing Ismail Ali Mohammed Abdulla explained how the firm has sent over 100 employees for training in Japan and is keen to partner projects with “technology-oriented universities that can be applied to our production lines."" Indeed, in 2016 the firm “celebrated the graduation of 105 Emiratis, bringing the Emiratization rate to 51%.""</p><p>Continental Aviation Services (CAS) is a veteran defense company in the Emirate. On the topic of trained employees, CEO Juergen Fiebig observed that, “The defense industry is typically not one where workers jump from one job to another; (rather they) seek to develop themselves within a company, build a network, and strengthen their capabilities."" The military is no exception either when it comes to leveraging education. In early 2016, HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, welcomed recruits to the new Seih Hafair Camp National Service School.<br>Meanwhile, touching on the chicken and egg scenario of importing know-how to enhance one's own independent capabilities, Fiebig commented that Abu Dhabi must now continue to import new technology while developing its own database of intellectual property.</p><h4>Aerospace: a Sector Taking off</h4><p>In 2002, the government of Abu Dhabi established Mubadala as the key investment engine of economic diversification with a wide remit of strategic sector participation, among which aerospace is vital. Its portfolio exceeds USD55 billion, and extends beyond national borders to commercial opportunities that promise a solid return on investment. The company today also showcases the Emirate by hosting the Global Aerospace Summit. The CEO of Mubadala subsidiary Strata points out that the UAE is leveraging its fortuitous geographic location between the East and the West, and four-hour flight radius to one-third of the world's population and two-thirds within eight. “We have two of the fastest-growing airports in the world in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, as well as two of the world's most competitive airlines, Etihad and Emirates. Therefore, the manufacturing sector of our aerospace industry is at the heart of a heavily globalized economy."" On this matter Continental Aviation Services (CAS) CEO Juergen Fiebig added, that GCC companies were targeting “alternate markets such as Russia, India, and the ASEAN economies.""</p><p>Strata has secured a contract to manufacture Airbus 1350-1000 flap-support fairings until 2023. Strata manufacturing produces commercial aircraft including the A330, A350, A380, 7A7, and 777, and, “For Phase II, we will begin building the Airbus A320, a horizontal tail aircraft."" According to its CEO, “The growth of our industry depends on four major factors. The first is being able to bring and win technologically advanced work packages; second is building on the human capital that we have and investing more in our people; third is building a local supply chain; and the fourth is an engaging and foreseeing growth strategy."" The firm, with its own dedicated R&amp;D department, has announced a cutting-edge 3D manufacturing project with Etihad and Siemens.</p><h4>Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park</h4><p>In a game-changer moment, Mudabala Aerospace and Abu Dhabi Airport Company in December 2015 announced building Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park to meet the diverse needs of the sector across the value chain. Strata's CEO noted that the regional aerospace hub was located Al Ain since its own 2030 Vision targets its becoming a key industrial hub. In support of the objective of a superlatively trained workforce, “Al Ain is an academic center hosting 21 institutions, which means that the region is home to the pool of highly educated talent needed for such an advanced industry. ""In January 2017, Phase I of Nibras was fully completed and leased at a 60% of its capacity (and is home to the Advanced Military Maintenance Repair &amp; Overhaul Center (AMMROC) and the Abu-Dhabi Autonomous System Investments (ADASI), among others."" Meanwhile, in a JV between Turbine Services and Solutions (TS&amp;S) and GE, TS&amp;S is creating a regional, state-of-the-art GEnx engine MRO facility within the park. CEO Abdul Khaliq Saeed summed up the sheer scope of the aerospace value chain thus, “The development of the Mubadala Aerospace sector, including increased capability development within the engine MRO business through offset deals worth over USD1 billion from General Electric and Rolls-Royce (plus) high technology composite manufacturing with Strata, and innovative financing solutions provided by Sanad have secured Abu Dhabi as a global aerospace hub.""</p><h4>Ground Control to Major Tom</h4><p>In a further leap for the UAE, space itself has become the next frontier. And having launched its own satellites, inked commercial deals, and designed its own space research center, progress made is already more tangible than dark matter. Yahsat, another subsidiary of Mubadala Development, operates two communications satellites. A third, the Al Yah 3 satellite, with an estimated launch date of June 30, 2017, will expand Yahsat's broadband footprint to 19 countries.</p><p>The scheduled space research center in Al Ain is a partnership between the UAE Space Agency, UAE University, and the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority was earmarked to cost around USD27.2 million. Its task is to foster related R&amp;D at the federal level as a stepping-stone for local innovation. The first such center in the Middle East, it has an ambitious goal of overseeing the development and operation of the UAE's unmanned Mars mission in 2021. And meanwhile, with space tourism seemingly around the corner for those with gravity-proof wallets (USD250,000 per ticket), Abu Dhabi-owned Aabar is an investment vehicle active in key sectors ranging from commodities, automotive, and energy to finance and real estate. In line with the national importance given to aerospace, it has purchased a total 37.8% stake in Virgin Galactic. It is even speculated that Abu Dhabi might ultimately boast the second Virgin Spaceport. And in 2019 Abu Dhabi is set to host the Global Space Congress, bringing together senior public and private figures, as well as academics, to explore the technology and training required to commercially exploit space.</p><p>It is clear then, that defense and aerospace industries are not only elevating the local content of strategic industries, but also proudly carrying the nation's flag into the far future. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/ca18da68-5bba-4d87-8833-2d4aee457429.jpg","","","","Identified as a key component of economic diversification, the UAE's aerospace industry is literally reaching new heights, with benefits felt in both military and civil arenas.","","","bang-on-target","1341","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58d2244186b7b029482eb779","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the Emirate's broader strategy of increasing non-oil contributions from 27% to 40% in 2030, it is expected that the industry sector will contribute a significant amount to diversification. Government investment in the industry sector reached upward of AED131 billion in 2016.</p><p>The local government has long supported a forward-thinking approach when it comes to industrial growth and diversification. Investment in infrastructure such as economic zones and transportation networks across the Emirate has played a vital role in feeding the market. In addition, the Emirate boasts a friendly business climate with simplified regulations and responsible governance, extensive access to developing markets, global connectivity through more than 200 airline routes, 150 shipping lanes, and 1,200km of railroads, as well as a tax-free environment and high quality of life, which attracts skilled industry sector staff. “By enhancing our presence here, we have added more timely services into our portfolio and are more effective in responding to our clients' needs. Abu Dhabi provides a good level of connectivity and access to the different markets,"" Dr. Ziad Awad, Senior Vice President of SNC-Lavalin, explained to TBY.</p><p>Although industrial areas with medium-quality warehousing and infrastructure posted a 9% decline in activity in 2016, Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) continues to invest heavily in world-class infrastructure and terminal capacity, inspiring other zones to improve their services and signaling a favorable outlook for companies and investors in 2017. Companies interested in Abu Dhabi's industrial zones range from businesses in the general trading sector, SMEs, construction companies, and IT providers. </p><h4>STEEL THE SCENE</h4><p>According to local media, Abu Dhabi's heavy industries segment comprises a strong pillar of the economy. Over the past 15 years, the Emirate has invested more than AED51 billion to establish robust industrial infrastructure, especially for aluminum and steel production.</p><p>Emirates Steel Industries (ESI) has led the way for other companies in the aluminum and steel industry, with figures rapidly growing over the past few years. Currently, the Emirate produces and exports thousands of premium quality products to more than 50 countries all over the world. With special attention to quality, ESI meets 60% of local market needs for the main categories and types of steel, while exporting the remainder of its production line to markets in Latin America, Europe, East Asia, and North America.</p><p>Up to 10% of ESI products are sold to aluminum producers, such as Emirates Global Aluminum (EGA). Already one of the world's five-largest aluminum producers, EGA seeks to increase its share of that market to 51% by 2020, becoming the Gulf's top aluminum supplier. EGA produces over 2.3 million tons of aluminum annually, employs nearly 7,000 staff, and adds value to the market with 95% of its products.</p><p>Due in large part to the growing demand for both steel and aluminum, experts predict that both products will continue to carry the bulk industry sector in the coming years. Meanwhile, the raw material produced by ESI plants at the Abu Dhabi Industrial Zone and by Al Taweelah, EGA's innovative aluminum extrusion plant based in Kizad, presents numerous opportunities to international industry sector players. “We worked with EGA to help boost the aluminum and industrial sectors where plants today are among the most efficient industrial sites in the world,"" SNC-Lavalin Vice President Awad said. “Through our partnership with TABREED, we have engineered, procured, built, and commissioned over 45 plants in the region. This has solidified our presence in light of the growing demand for clean and efficient solutions.""</p><h4>IN THE ZONE</h4><p>Fueling Abu Dhabi's industrial boom are its expansive free trade zones, which allow investors and operators to benefit from strategic geographic advantages and cost-effective facilities</p><p>The Industrial City of Abu Dhabi (ICAD) spans 40sqkm and connects to transportation hubs at various points—developed roads, storage, and logistic hubs that have convenient access to multiple ports and airports. Each cluster in the ICAD supports world-class infrastructure and benefits from reliable utilities and advanced communication networks, where flexible plot sizes appeal to a wide variety of investors. The site is already home to numerous steel and metals producers, as well as construction materials companies, logistics operators, FMCG manufacturers, and oil and gas players. The ICAD has been designed, constructed, and operates according to international technical and environmental standards, and features scalability that can accommodate future demand and growth.</p><p>Meanwhile, free zone giant ZonesCorp is carrying out plans for a major new auto hub in Abu Dhabi. ZonesCorp is currently home to over 650 industrial facilities, receiving over AED29 billion worth of investment from local and international companies since its tax-free economic zones were created. As the body responsible for developing specialized economic zones in the emirate, ZonesCorp is presenting developing 12sqkm of space for automotive manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and parts providers. The first phase of the project, which will require approximately AED2 billion and focus on key infrastructure, is expected to be completed in 2017. Upon completion, the zone will offer up to 1,800 plots to be used as car showrooms, service centers, workshops, and warehouses. Additionally in 2017, ZonesCorp is working to set up 261 prefabricated, ready-to-use units covering 300,000sqm in the ICAD. In total, ZonesCorp has set aside 80% of the units for warehousing and 20% for industrial use, spending over AED90 million on the first phase. In an interview with the press, Saaed Eisa Al Khyeli, the Director General of ZonesCorp said, “This project is designed to fac­ilitate the growth of SMEs and to meet the growing demand for high-quality, flexible warehousing,"" adding, “The flourishing SME sector is the cornerstone of any thriving economy and the UAE is no different. The project is also firmly in line with the Abu Dhabi 2030 Vision to build a sustainable and diversified, high value-added economy."" ZonesCorp reported that nearly AED160 million of externally sourced investment was injected toward these future projects by the end of 1Q2017. Companies setting up in the industrial city include Innovida Warehouses Management, Fibrex Construction Group, Petro Hub, Riviere Mineral Water Factory, and the Aertssen Group.</p><h4>NOT JUST PAPER PRODUCTS</h4><p>Acknowledging favorable business conditions, several key industrial players are expanding their operations in Abu Dhabi. Manufacturing in particular accounts for 86% of spending in the industry sector, and shows no signs of slowing down.</p><p>3M, the multinational manufacturing and mining conglomerate, targets double-digit growth in Abu Dhabi in 2017. One of the ways the company is working to accomplish rapid growth is through the expansion of the local workforce, specifically Emiratization, as well as through public and private partnerships.</p><p>Local industry player ADNIP is currently worth AED800 million, with a current growth trajectory of becoming an AED2 billion company over the short term. “The immediate plans for 2017 is to do mergers and acquire new business lines that will awake the interest of other companies,"" Mounir S. Haddad, CEO of ADNIP, told TBY. Among the company's many business segments, paper production increased from 65,000 tons to 95,000 tons over a recent 12-month period. “The new machine produces advanced NTT paper, a higher absorbance, softer, and bulkier paper with very unique qualities that is only produced in Mexico, Chile, and the UAE,"" Haddad said. To that end, the company fully meets local demand. ADNIP's carpet business has fared equally well, with sales figures increasing from 200 million to 270 million YoY. However, the company is not focused solely on quantity, instead emphasizing quality to stand apart from the competition and build stronger client relationships. “Mass production competitors find it more difficult to comply with timings and deliveries and that is where they lose out in comparison to ADNIP. We also cover the more protected markets, such as Saudi Arabia, where mass production companies have difficulties entering due to high taxes and strict requirements,"" Haddad concluded. ADNIP's brand reputation has also given it a competitive edge as an exporter. Currently, 90% of ADNIP's medical devices are shipped abroad to destinations such as Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. <br>Abu Dhabi Vegetable Oil Company (ADVOC) has also found an advantage as an Abu Dhabi-based industrial exporter. Overall, approximately 40% of ADVOC's output is destined for foreign shores. Meanwhile, the company's annual growth rate has averaged at 8%, a figure boosted by general market confidence and the convenience of being located at Mina Zayed Port. In an interview with TBY, Colin Smith, CEO of ADVOC, said, “We are in the final stages of completing another building to serve the specialty fats business. We also plan to increase our capacity, hence why we made significant investments in the expansion of our facilities and distribution channels."" Apart from its strong presence in the UAE, ADVOC has a strong footprint in the GCC markets.</p><p>For FMCG producers such as Agthia, sales continue to post impressive growth. “Our water segment is growing at 15% and it still represents the core business for us,"" Iqbal Hamzah, CEO of Agthia, told TBY. The company boasts new entries in its product portfolio for 2017, mainly freshly squeezed juices, rebranded flavored water, and new packaging for fruit-based products. Currently the number-one flour mill in Abu Dhabi, Agthia is a key supplier of the local market. “By 2020, we plan to cover the entire region with a strong footprint in each market. We also play an important role in developing the targets stipulated by Abu Dhabi's 2030 Vision and we commend all efforts to diversify its economy and bumper non-oil exports in the years ahead,"" Hamzah concluded.<br></p><p>Abu Dhabi's national investment firm Mubadala recently announced a partnership with the Dubai Future Foundation and GE to establish Abu Dhabi as a microfactory base for serving industrial firms. Combining innovation and educational ecosystems with fast, efficient, and sustainable manufacturing capabilities, micro factories offer the Emirate a range of new industrial possibilities and grant access to global best practices in manufacturing. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/03a420bb-e2e2-42e9-8d8f-b2170476c42b.jpg","","","","Abu Dhabi's push to develop both heavy and light industries is paying off, as the sector now accounts for over 10% of GDP and continues to attract investment.","","","the-holy-grail","1526","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global demand for natural gas is expected to continue to rise dramatically; while some conservative estimates place the increase in natural gas demand at 48% by 2040, the Ministry of Energy estimates demand to grow as much as 70% by 2040. Abu Dhabi is adjusting its economic strategy accordingly, as at 215 trillion cubic feet, the UAE contains the seventh-largest proven gas reserves in the world, with the 95% of those reserves located in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Despite the massive amount of gas reserves, the UAE became a net importer of natural gas in 2008, with most of this gas coming from Qatar through the Dolphin Pipeline. The UAE is one of the top-five energy consumers per capita, with 80% of its power generated from natural gas. Additionally, 30% of the natural gas harvested in the UAE is re-injected into the country's oil fields to maintain the reservoir pressure needed to extract crude petroleum most efficiently.</p><p>The issue is not that the UAE does not have enough natural gas, but that many of the gas reserves have been largely inaccessible due to the highly sulfurous sour gas that sits below the desert sand. These gas heavy sour gas fields often require huge investments and safety risks that often make them financially unfeasible. However, advancements in technology have made these types of projects seem much more appealing. Shah Gas Development (SGD) Project, a joint venture by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (60%) and Occidental Petroleum (40%), began unlocking the enormous energy potential hidden in the Shah Arab reservoir in 2011. Run by ADNOC subsidiary Al Hosn Gas, the SDP Project is the largest operation of its kind in the world, producing 1 billion scf of raw gas per day. </p><p>For Phase I of the SGD Project, developers initially planned on investing USD17 billion to produce the gathering system, the processing plant, pipelines, and the sulfur granulation system. However, recent developments allowed the facilities to be created for only USD10 billion. These innovations make the expansion of sour gas more feasible than ever before.</p><p>ADNOC is already spearheading new projects to replicate its success at new sour gas fields, notably the Bab sour gas field southwest of Abu Dhabi, as well as the Hail and Ghasha offshore fields to the northwest of the capital. The 30-year project at the Bab field is expected to produce over 500 million scf per day of usable gas. However, the gas locked beneath the Bab field is dry and even more heavily sour than at the Shah reservoir, making it more difficult to bring that gas to market. These challenges played a part in Royal Dutch Shell withdrawing from its partnership with ADNOC on the USD10 billion investment in 2016.</p><p>Given the ever-quickening demand for gas, it is unlikely that the UAE will slow down in its pursuit of new sour gas projects and the technologies that make it possible to harness otherwise impractical resources. On the future of sour gas, Al Hosn Gas CEO Saif Alghefli said, “With the success of Al Hosn Gas, a slew of projects are lined up within the UAE and there appears to be a healthy competition to see who can first deliver the next major gas project. I see a healthy environment that is not only bringing huge investments to the gas sector, but also the latest technology, while generating employment opportunities.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sour gas","not-all-hot-air","1388","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784058","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-13T12:57:00.000Z","2017-09-13T12:57:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A tale of Two","<p>The general consensus is that ADNOC has responded nimbly to the drop in oil prices. Part of that is due to the groundwork that was laid beforehand. Hatem Nuseibeh, president for Total UAE, told TBY, “Abu Dhabi started taking the right steps even before oil prices went downhill. … [For the past three years] I noticed local authorities doing the groundwork and making preparations in case of a lower oil price environment.“ Salem Ashoor, his counterpart at British Petroleum in the UAE, built on this sentiment, telling TBY, “ADNOC has embarked upon a journey that will become the new benchmark for NOCs, where capability, technology, efficiency, and selectivity will become vital when it comes to building partnerships.“</p><p>The latest move from the company has been the launch of ADNOC's 2030 Strategy. Approved by the UAE Supreme Petroleum Council in November 2016, the strategy aims at driving ADNOC's long-term success in an evolving energy market and strengthening the company's role as a major contributor to the country's development and economic diversification objectives. The 2030 strategy aims to turn the institution into a more agile and resilient company, driven by performance, focused on people, and with an overarching ambition to have the highest KPIs in the industry.</p><p>The strategy presents a roadmap for the company's upstream, midstream, and downstream areas to make its business as profitable as possible. On the upstream side, which represents ADNOC's largest source of revenue, the company seeks to achieve a production target of 3.5 million bpd by 2018, a substantial increase from the 400,000bpd that were reported in November 2016. ADNOC also announced its intentions to focus on the exploration of new and innovative technologies for enhanced oil recovery and sour gas resources. The guidelines culminated in a transformation path that began with the merging of ADMA-OPCO and ZADCO into one single entity and the opening of Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations' (ADCO) onshore oilfield concessions, which has led multinationals the likes of BP, Total, GS Energy, Inpex, and CNPC to invest in 40% of the shares of Abu Dhabi's leading upstream company, opened to private financing in 2016. The strategy also includes a technology transfer agreement between ADNOC and its peer Saudi Aramco.</p><p>On the downstream side, the company will revamp its refining and petrochemicals business to enhance profitability. With a growing demand for these products inside the UAE and in Asian markets, ADNOC plans on increasing its investments in new downstream projects, including gasoline and aromatics production, as well as additional polyolefin capacity. Strategy 2030 contemplates a three-fold increase in Abu Dhabi's domestic petrochemical output by 2025. This target has been recently strengthened by the agreements signed with ExxonMobil, Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves, and investments carried by Mubadala's Borealis in the western region. Strategy 2030 also includes Abu Dhabi's first fully integrated Gas Master Plan, a commitment to provide the gas necessary to meet the Emirate's demand and the restructuring of gas prices.<br>Talking about the company's new roadmap, Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of ADNOC, expressed, “Our ultimate goal is to remain a key contributor to the UAE economy and a leading player in advancing the industry (…) we will ensure the oil and gas needs of our domestic and international customers are met and also enhance our downstream and petrochemical businesses to take advantage of growing demand for higher value products.“ Dr. Al Jaber's message is clear: ADNOC is willing to transform as many times as necessary in order to overcome the market's adversities.</p><p>The 2030 Strategy is completed by leadership and youth development programs to enhance the capability of local talent. The programs are intended to foster a breed of Emiratis capable of coping with the new scenario of ADNOC's activities, become increasingly specialized on technology-driven machinery, and enable global mobility of local staff. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ADNOC 2030 Strategy","a-tale-of-two","1368","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784058","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-13T11:37:00.000Z","2017-09-13T11:37:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Diverse Future","<p>The UAE is one of the world's largest and most strategically positioned energy producers. In 2015, the value of petroleum exports from the Emirates was around USD52.4 billion, but by the end of 2017 revenues from hydrocarbons are expected to reach USD65 billion, a figure that represents approximately 20% of the country's total export revenue. Moving forward, however, the Emirates hope to expand and diversify its energy base, and Abu Dhabi is taking a leading role in these efforts. Cutting-edge renewable projects are allowing the Emirate to position itself as a global leader in sustainable energy. Large-scale nuclear projects are set to come online in coming years, too, helping Abu Dhabi sate its growing demand for electricity. Nations across the globe are sitting up and taking notice, and Abu Dhabi is positioned to remain a leader in renewable energy innovation.</p><h4>Oil &amp; Gas</h4><p>Oil and gas remain the most significant sources of energy in the UAE, and nearly 40% of the country's GDP depends on these sectors, according to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). According to the latest BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the UAE has nearly 98 billion barrels of proven oil reserves—or almost 6% of the world's total—the vast majority of which are located in Abu Dhabi. The UAE consumes roughly 900,000 barrels of oil per day, the overall refinery throughput sits at around 659,000 barrels per day (bpd), and the total refinery capacity is more than 1.1 million bpd.</p><p>The UAE has roughly 6 trillion cubic meters (cbm) in proven natural gas reserves, and the country's robust gas extraction infrastructure allows it to produce almost 56 billion cbm per year. Domestic consumption is around 69 billion cbm per year, and imports are mostly channeled through the Qatari pipeline, while most of the UAE's LNG exports, around 7.2 billion cbm, make their way to Japan. The Dolphin Energy pipeline stretches from Qatar's prosperous gas fields all the way to Abu Dhabi's Taweelah power plant, injecting much-demanded gas into the Emirate's power generation system. As domestic demand continues to grow, LNG will become a more important piece of Abu Dhabi's energy portfolio. The Emirate is a leader in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, and public and private sector officials have been spearheading development in gas extraction so the Emirate can rely on domestically produced resources. </p><p>The Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) drafts Abu Dhabi's petroleum strategies and goals. The SPC is one of the Emirate's most important energy-related bodies, and it plays a central role in determining the country's energy direction. Tasked with fulfilling the directives of the SPC and managing the operations of the country's petroleum resources, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) operates more than 20 subsidiary institutions, three academic and training institutes, and four research and innovation centers. ADNOC's subsidiaries operate across a number of areas, including natural gas and oil exploration, processing, and delivery.</p><p>According to ADNOC, the Emirate produces roughly 3 million barrels of oil per day and almost 10 billion cubic feet of raw natural gas. Despite flat oil prices in recent years, ADNOC hopes to expand its productions output to 3.5 million bpd by 2018. One of ADNOC's largest subsidiaries is the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations (ADOC), which has a capacity of more than 1.4 million bpd and operates over 1,300 oil and gas wells over six fields. The Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company is capable of producing around 650,000 bpd, and it operates 218 oil and gas wells and 36 platforms. One of the world's largest oil fields in the world, the Zakum Oilfield, is located in Abu Dhabi and is operated by the Zakum Development Company.</p><h4>Electricity</h4><p>Growth in the UAE and Abu Dhabi over the past few years has greatly expanded the electricity demand in the Emirate, taxing the existing power grid. According to the Emirates News Agency, electricity demand is poised to explode, and by 2020 demand is forecast to grow by 50%. This has prompted officials to begin developing and implementing plans to expand and bolster the grid. Currently, the majority of the UAE's electricity comes from gas-operated generators, and by the end of 2017 the country's generation capacity is expected to surpass 130TWH and installed capacity is expected to reach almost 35GW. Abu Dhabi has one of the most privatized electricity markets in the UAE, and plans are afoot to expand private industry participation. Each independent power producer in Abu Dhabi is still, however, some sort of joint venture between state-owned Abu Dhabi Water &amp; Electricity Company (ADWEC) and private groups and all electricity is sold to ADWEC.<br>As a whole, the UAE has plans to expand its power generation system by more than 21GW in the next 13 years, with nuclear, coal-fired, solar, and gas-fired facilities each representing around one-quarter of the projects in the pipeline. By diversifying the power base of the Emirate, officials hope to strengthen the country's position as a global energy powerhouse and ensure that the country has the resources it needs to lead the GCC into the future.</p><h4>Renewables</h4><p>As Abu Dhabi seeks to diversify its energy matrix, green energy is becoming a larger and larger part of the equation. Solar in particular has garnered the attention of stakeholders all across the country, and the Emirate is taking important steps toward meaningful diversification. The UAE has committed to generating 7% of its energy from renewables by 2020. With more than 5GW of solar energy projects currently in some stage of development, the Emirates look well on their way to achieving this lofty goal.</p><p>Sustainability and green energy are key parts of the UAE's energy strategy, and officials are working hard to ensure that responsible usage practices become ubiquitous across the country. One of the main ways they have been working to ensure this is through targeted awareness and engagement programs. The ultimate goal is to change the country's attitude toward energy use. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Dr. Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, discussed the ministry's efforts to create awareness and generate change. “Now we are working to portray the facts, figures, and the story through the media, to make sure that we present the right message to the widest possible audience,"" said Al Zeyoudi. Sustainability is not something that is limited to the government, or to the private sector; sustainability is a duty for each member of society and person on the planet.""</p><p>In the first quarter of 2017, Abu Dhabi signed a solar power deal that will result in some of the region's cheapest renewable energy. The deal—a joint project between ADWEC, Japan's Marubeni, and China's Jinko Solar—will see the construction of the world's largest solar facility in the Emirate. The 1.17GW Sweihan plant will be capable of powering 200,000 residences. The plant is expected to begin producing energy by April 2019, according to The National. Nearly USD900 million in funding has been raised thus far. According to Bloomberg, the Sweihan plant will bring Abu Dhabi one step closer to offering renewable electricity at a lower price than coal-fired electricity, an accomplishment that could be a game-changer for renewable projects and green energy across the globe. With electricity prices expected to be less than 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, the Sweihan plant will provide electricity at nearly half the average global cost of power from coal-fired plants, sending a strong signal to the energy industry about the potential and value of solar power generation.</p><p>Other notable renewable projects include a joint venture between Abu Dhabi's Masdar, a leading renewable energy firm, and Sharjah's Bee'ah. According to Bloomberg, the joint venture's first project is set to be a 30MW power plant capable of utilizing and transforming more than 300,000 tons of solid waste every year.</p><h4>Nuclear</h4><p>There are big plans for nuclear energy in Abu Dhabi. After signing a deal with the US in early 2009, the UAE has been working closely with the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) to develop the country's nascent nuclear power program. The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) is in the midst of a USD20 billion construction program that will see the development of Barakah plant in Abu Dhabi's Western Region.</p><p>With two reactor vessels installed so far, and the first set to begin operations in 2018, the facility is well on its way toward completion, and it promises to become a revolutionary piece of Abu Dhabi's energy matrix. Officials expect that the Barakah facility will have all four reactor vessels up and running by 2020, and the construction of this massive facility is being led by a consortium of firms, including ENEC and the Korea Electric Power Corporation. Once complete, the Barakah plant is expected is generate one-quarter of the country's energy requirements and save nearly 12 million tons of greenhouse gases. According to The National, there have been some recent delays in construction, but the government is dedicated to ensuring that the plant is completed according to the most rigorous international safety standards. Moving forward, Abu Dhabi is set to be a leader across a number of different energy sectors. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/a930c6d5-8652-4246-abbc-17a2d25d8a2e.jpg","","","","While oil and gas remain Abu Dhabi's most important energy sources in terms of domestic consumption and exports, cutting-edge renewable projects are garnering more attention and investment from public and private stakeholders.","","","a-diverse-future","1580","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784058","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-13T11:25:00.000Z","2017-09-13T11:25:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Peace Of Mind","<p>Though the insurance market in the UAE faced certain difficulties in recent years, 2016 witnessed a return to growth, and 2017 promises to be marked by strong profits. Traditional and takaful insurance providers enjoyed strong growth in 2016, with top-line premiums expanding at 11.1% in traditional providers and 5.5% for takaful providers, according to the consulting firm Milliman. Gross written premiums (GWP) for traditional insurance firms listed on the UAE's stock exchanges sit at almost AED16 billion, while GWP for takaful firms is around AED3 billion. According to the UAE's Insurance Authority (IA), gross premiums across all insurance classes sit at around AED37 billion, while the total volume of assets invested in the insurance sector is AED45.7 billion. </p><p>According to the most recently available statistics from the IA, foreign firms accounted for 79.4% of written premiums for insurance of persons and fund accumulations operations, and national companies accounted for 20.6%. In terms of property and liability insurance, however, the balance was reversed, with national firms accounting for 74.1% of written premiums and foreign firms accounting for 25.9%. Medical insurance accounted for the majority of written premiums in this category, representing 47.8%, and accidents and liability, fire, and land, sea, and air transport were the other major categories, accounting for 34.3%, 8.4%, and 6%, respectively. According to the most recently available statistics from the IA, there were more than 1.3 million policies underwritten in the country. Limited Liability Automotive captured the largest share of the policy pool, accounting for more than 630,000 policies. Comprehensive Automotive, Personal Accident and Aviation insurance were the next largest categories, representing 289,322, 30,458, and 30,084, respectively.<br>Since 2007, the UAE's Insurance Authority has been the oversight body in charge of regulating the insurance industry in the Emirates. The authority is responsible for a host of activities, including regulating all activity related to the insurance sector, encouraging national savings and investing in responsible ways, stimulating competition, promoting the insurance industry in a transparent and prudent fashion, and ensuring high-quality products are being sold at reasonable prices. Under the IA's watch, the insurance industry in Abu Dhabi and the country has expanded its bottom lines and increased coverage and profitability while insulating the market.</p><p>In response to market volatility in 2014 and 2015, the IA introduced new regulations that restrict the kinds of assets insurance companies are allowed to invest in. Insurance firms are allowed to invest only 30% of their assets in real estate and equity vehicles, and only 20% of those equities can be outside the UAE. Firms are allowed to be fully invested in UAE sovereign debt instruments. The regulations also require that external and internal auditing controls be established, and a third phase of new regulations are set to be implemented by the end of 2017. These regulations have helped the market return to a more natural equilibrium, setting the stage for responsible growth in 2016 and 2017. Insurance companies across Abu Dhabi are preparing to implement the latest round of regulations, and officials are confident that the new requirements will undergird sustainable long-term growth. Government regulators and Abu Dhabi insurance executives alike view the regulations as key steps in the development of the Emirate's financial service sector, and they are optimistic that increased oversight will spur the sector to greater heights.</p><p>However, not all new regulations from the IA have been met quite as warmly. New tariffs on vehicle insurance have the potential to increase premiums by as much as 35%, according to the Gulf News. These new regulations are expected to disproportionately impact customers at the middle and lower levels of the market. With automotive insurance representing the largest policy pool in the market, consumers and industry leaders are watching these developments closely.</p><p>In its most recently published report, the Abu Dhabi National Insurance Company (ADNIC), one of the largest insurers in the Emirate and the country, disclosed its decision to increase capital reserves in order to both adhere to government regulations and better insulate itself against fluctuations in the oil and gas sector. Additionally, ADNIC has been spearheading a digital transformation of the industry, introducing new e-services and smart systems technology. Founded in 1972, ADNIC is one of the oldest insurance companies in the UAE and is working to position itself as the largest insurer in the country by developing a new line of innovative and bespoke insurance products to the UAE market such as wedding insurance products and enhanced home insurance products. Insurers in Abu Dhabi see product innovation as one of the most important methods of stimulating continued growth in the market, and new lines and products are being unveiled this year.<br>Abu Dhabi National Takaful had similarly impressive results in 2016, recording 16.4% growth in net profits. Despite market volatility and low oil prices, insurance firms in Abu Dhabi have been able to record strong growth. Khamis Buharoon Al Shamsi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Abu Dhabi National Takaful Co. PSC, attributed his company's robust growth to prudent operations strategies and a sound grounding in the takaful model. These sharia-compliant alternatives are a growing aspect of the financial services market in Abu Dhabi and the GCC.</p><p>Emiratization has been a strategic objective of the IA for a quite a while, and insurance companies in Abu Dhabi have been making inroads. Still, according to the most recently available data from the IA, the number of employees working in the technical departments of insurance companies totaled 2,900 people, and only 340 of those, or 11.7%, were UAE nationals. Abu Dhabi insurance authorities have been working with the IA to develop more vocational interest in the insurance sector among the Emirate's youth. This plan includes a long-term vision that relies on training and awareness programs aimed at both stimulating growth in Emirati employment and instilling the technical and business training required for Emiratis to take mid and upper level management positions within the insurance industry.</p><p>In recent months there has been some discussion regarding the impact oversupply could have on the insurance market in the UAE, with some market observers noting that increased competition has led to declining prices. With more than 60 providers insuring less than 10 million people, falling prices have been a boon for consumers but a headache for insurance companies. Profitability has fallen as result, but the rise of compulsory coverage has the potential to offset competition-driven price declines. Moving forward, the insurance industry in Abu Dhabi is ripe for some form of consolidation, but the potential for healthy profits remains. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Insurance","peace-of-mind-uae-abu-dhabi-2017","1298","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-13T11:08:00.000Z","2017-09-13T11:08:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Sleek Operator","<p>A millennium child, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) came into being on November 15, 2000 through Local Law No. 3 of the same year that cemented its autonomous status, independent finance and management, as well as the supervisory and executive powers determining its operations. To expand its offering and footprint, the ADX has signed agreements with key financial institutions to deliver custody services, including the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, and Citi Banking Group.</p><p>The prestige the ADX enjoys today in the international capital markets is also catalytic in meeting the economic and social goals of the Abu Dhabi government's Vision 2030. Philippe Ghanem, the Vice Chairman &amp; CEO of prominent sector player ADS Securities, told TBY of the rapid pace of change since his firm opened its doors in 2010, and an advantage that the local capital markets have exploited. Namely, “Here in the region Abu Dhabi is a relatively new financial market, which does not have legacy issues, and, accordingly, we have been able to use regulation to support best practice and growth.“ What is more, the UAE is a commercial gateway for the GCC, which can only gain traction as countries in the wider region expand their commercial footprints. “Abu Dhabi has emerged as the offshore wealth center of choice and we see massive opportunity for our asset and wealth management business,“ Ghanem concluded.</p><p>The bourse facilitates the trading of securities including the shares of public joint stock companies, as well as corporate and government bonds, exchange traded funds, and financial instruments OK'd by the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA). Listed companies trade under the sectors of banking, real estate, consumer staples, investment and financial services, industrial, telecommunication, services, energy, and insurance. By end-2016 the MCap of companies listed on the ADX was at AED475 billion (2015 AED437 billion), where that of local firms was AED444 billion. For the year, July had seen a peak of AED482 billion.</p><h4>Ratings and Accolades</h4><p>In 2009 the ADX was dubbed an Emerging Market by FTSE, and two years later by S&amp;P and Russell Investments. And two years after that, ADX also received EM status from the MSCI index and S&amp;P Dow Jones, a passport to enhanced inward investment flows. In 2015, ADX picked up the Most Innovative Exchange GCC 2015 Award. And in 2016 the bourse garnered the 4th Middle East Financial Markets Excellence Award given annually by the Middle East Excellence Awards Institute. And in a pioneering moment for the ADX it received the ITP. Gov Award 2017 for its adoption of time-saving blockchain technology in eVoting, a first in MENA financial markets. The ADX also became a member of The Institute of International Finance (IIF), the first MENA regional bourse to do so.</p><h4>Propelling the Vision</h4><p>In 2016 an MoU was signed between the ADX and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the capital's international financial center located on the 114ha Al Maryah Island. The latter is a financial free zone established by Cabinet Resolution Number 15 of 2013 that buttresses the Emirate's long-term development plans. Ultimately a self-contained community, it will accommodate leading-edge financial and commercial enterprises overseen by three independent authorities, namely the Financial Services Regulator, the Registration Bureau, and the courts. Meanwhile, its high-end residential and leisure offering befits Abu Dhabi's international significance and investor appeal. This MoU, then, paves the way for bilateral cooperation on joint development of financial products and services further fine tuning Abu Dhabi's sustainable financial environment within the scope of Abu Dhabi Vision 2030.</p><h4>Innovation-a Virtuous Circle</h4><p>The ADX launched its new highly user-friendly website in 2016. Elsewhere, too, stock market participants were enriching the offering. ADS Securities launched OREX Mobile, which Vice Chairman &amp; CEO Ghanem described as “the first-ever multi-asset smartphone trading application with full Arabic language functionality (designed) to enhance the trading experience for professionals and private investors.“ Meanwhile, on a national level, the UAE's introduction of 5% VAT, by IMF calculations, is set to generate additional revenue comprising 1.5% of GDP, at roughly AED12 billion. As the IMF points out, this revenue will be directed to government services and infrastructure projects that in turn will be realized by listed companies.</p><h4>The Landscape in 2016</h4><p>The ADX general index closed 2016 at 4,546 points, marking a firm 5.55% YoY rise from the 2015 close of 4,307. The peak close of that year, seen in 2Q2016, was 4,637. Historically, the index peaked at 6,237.98 in April of 2005 and troughed at 1,001.81 in July 2001. And as of April 6 the benchmark index had shed 0.55% from the previous close to end at 4,615. As of that date the 52-week high and low were respectively at 4,715.05 and 4,174.71. The 50-day average volume printed at 114,527,800, and the one-month and 12-month index changes were at a respective 0.24% and 7.35%.</p><h4>Investor Breakdown</h4><p>By the end of 2016, the ADX had roughly 961,807 registered investors, with 3,874 issued compared to 8,192 a year earlier; 3,348 were issued to individuals and 526 to institutions. Of the total, 1710 were issued to UAE nationals, 245 to the GCC, 830 to Arab nationals, and 1,089 to all other nationalities. Global headwinds and the uncertainty brought by regional conflict and commodity prices in 2016 meant that where the total value of trades on ADX reached close to AED100 billion, net foreign investments were at around AED3.4 billion, down 41% YoY from the AED5.8 billion of 2015. Non-UAE investors bought 12 billion shares totaling AED25 billion and sold AED11.8 billion amounting to AED21.6 billion. Looking at the total value of trades, UAE investors accounted for the bulk, at AED51 billion. Among foreign participants, UK investors led with roughly AED10 billion, followed by US investors with AED7.5 billion, Jordanians with AED3.4 billion, Luxembourg investors with AED2.7 billion, and Saudi investors with AED1.8 billion. Thus for the year, non-UAE investors, making up 48% of the total value of trades executed on the ADX, had climbed 5% YoY. The volume of trades rose 6% YoY in 2016 to approximately 29 billion shares compared with 28 billion in 2015, where February's 5 billion shares traded marked the high water mark for the year.

"2017-09-13T09:47:00.000Z","2017-09-13T09:47:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Strength in Prudence","<p>As the world plays catch with a hand grenade at the edge of a volcano, there has never been a more prescient time to seek out relatively safe financial havens. Indeed, such a status has been a USP of the UAE's financial universe in recent years, where the banks of its capital Abu Dhabi continue to loom large. Meanwhile, strong regulation and Basel-flavored compliance will ensure that the well-capitalized banking arena is also one of prudent behavior. It might need to bend a degree regarding credit, as the nation's SMEs, vital to the economic diversification of key sectors, will increasingly demand more competitive options. The Emirate has also seen telling structural and corporate machinations that confirm a firm grasp of the long game.</p><h4>The Central Bank</h4><p>The groundwork has certainly been laid by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), and recognized, too, by the World Economic Forum's 2016-2017 Global Competitiveness Report. Accordingly, the UAE ranked 16th overall among 138 countries on a print of 5.26 out of seven, up from 17 and 5.24 YoY, retaining dominion over the MENA region. Moreover, the UAE ranks 28th for financial market development for the period. Meanwhile, it ranks 13th for financial services meeting business needs, 24th for the affordability of financial services, 21st for financing through the local equity market, 16th for ease of access to loans, seventh for venture capital availability, and lastly but certainly not least, 17th for the soundness of banks in place, up from 21st place previously.</p><p>In conversation with TBY, Mubarak Rashed Al Mansoori, the CBUAE's Governor, touched on key topics ranging from economic diversification to fiscal policy and ongoing sector reform. Regarding the former, the bank estimates the nation's non-oil activities rising by around about 2.7-2.8% in 2017 with precision manufacturing having blossomed in the Emirate. Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030 envisages the development of strategic sectors capable of luring foreign investment, notably in export-oriented sectors including manufacturing, telecommunications, transport, tourism, and energy. The bank's 2017-2021 strategy also maintains a commitment to the fixed peg of the dirham's exchange rate against the US dollar, whereby in parrying the blows of external shocks, and reflecting the direction of US interest rate policy, “Our focus is on the liquidity needs of banks with a forward-looking agenda.“</p><h4>The Cost of Regulation <br></h4><p>The regulatory framework underpins the nation's international reputation as a prestigious financial services provider. Yet a tough nut to crack is knowing when to activate macro prudential instruments to mitigate global shocks to the local economy, and when to foster a more liquid climate conducive to funding private sector activity. Certainly it seems that general liquidity will be pressured over the coming years as fresh regulations boost operating expenses of banks. The IFRS9 Standard to be introduced in January 2018 demands that banks risk-rate every new loan and immediately provision for it, again denting earnings. It is no stretch to foresee SMEs struggling to secure credit under such conditions. Meanwhile, as the sector marches towards Basel III standards for capital and liquidity, risk management at banks is under scrutiny. And this year, work may be expected on “a new overarching Corporate Governance regulation for consultation with the banking sector.“<br>Tirad Al Mahmoud is the CEO of Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB). In conversation with TBY he touched on the UAE's new Bankruptcy Law, which he felt “marks the beginning of an evolution (being) a positive aspect of any sophisticated economy.“ His interpretation was that advanced legal frameworks would underpin “a period of suspicion, where if an individual or commercial entity declares bankruptcy, a legal entity may investigate their assets anywhere from 12 to 36 months before their declaration.“ This will provide the banks and regulatory agencies “a rearview mirror to properly assess the validity of bankruptcy claims.“</p><h4>Some Numbers</h4><p>The CBUAE's 2016 Annual Report reveals its total assets declining from AED393 billion in 2015 to AED364 billion in 2016. The largest asset on the consolidated balance sheet was held-to-maturity foreign securities, which at AED149 billion in 2016, had slipped from 2015's AED164 billion. Fluctuating deposits with the Central Bank rose 25.3% YoY from AED76 billion in 2014 to AED96 billion in 2015, only to fall to AED61 billion by year-end 2016. A continued uptrend was observed in cash and bank balances held by the Central Bank, which skyrocketed 87.16% YoY from AED42 billion at end-2014 to AED78 billion for 2015 and to AED90 billion at end-2016. Meanwhile, derivative assets fell hugely during 2015—one of the only balance sheet items to do so—to just AED334 million from AED7.53 billion a year earlier, recovering strongly to AED8.746 billion at end-2016. Gold bullion at AED940 million at end-2015 rose to AED1.015 billion a year later. The deficit of the UAE's financial account, widening by AED77.6 billion in 2016 to AED89.5 billion, at 6.6% of GDP, largely reflected banking sector activity.</p><h4>The Landscape</h4><p>Moody's outlook for the UAE is welcome, where good sector performance is ensured by stable core income from higher fees and commissions. Accordingly it expects the core profitability of the UAE's five largest banks (as of December 2016 accounting for 62% of the total banking universe by total assets) to remain firm over the next 12-18 months. Incidentally, Emirates NBD, the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, First Gulf Bank, and Dubai Islamic Bank posted a combined net profit of AED6.8 billion in 4Q2016 (-2% QoQ). Their combined Tier-1 capital ratio inched up QoQ to 17.3% from 16.9%. In the fourth quarter, banks' overall profitability was resilient, despite a decline in UAE's non-oil real GDP growth to 2.5% in 2016 from a 2012 peak of 6.4%, weighed by weak oil prices. Banks' fourth quarter performance was underpinned by higher fee and commission income from retail and corporate lending services. And for 2017, Moody's foresees pressure arising from higher funding costs amid further-squeezed liquidity, with the persistent economic slowdown also applying the brakes. Another metric of importance in the UAE Vision 2021 is Emiratization. “The banking sector (was) already employing 38,000 Emiratis as of the end of August 2016,“ thus comparing favorably with other private sector industries, according to the CBUAE governor. </p><p>According to the UAE Banks Federation, UAE banks can expect a 10-20% decline in profit for 2017 as oil prices remain deflated and tourism numbers fall on global concerns. It anticipates sector profit to be either flat, or else within the plus or minus 5% range, with loan growth falling from 2016's 4.5% to 3.5%. Yet by global comparison, says the Federation, the UAE's banking sector is set to fare better than those of Europe, Japan, and the US, thanks to excellent ratios; a 16.5% capital adequacy ratio outperforms the global 12.5% minimum. NBAD reported a net profit of AED5.296 billion for FY2016, yet the performance was somewhat offset by volatility in financial and currency markets, both overshadowed by political and economic question marks.<br>Institute of International Finance (IIF) numbers indicate that the UAE's credit growth slipped to 6% YoY in 2016, from 7.8% with a single-digit forecast for 2017. This is attributable to the key borrowers such as the state investment holding Mubadala, “deleveraging significantly, as the Abu Dhabi government finances its budget deficit through its Sovereign Wealth Fund, rather than through bank borrowing.“ Yet the IIF notes that despite more moderate activity and rising interest rates, these concerns are mitigated among the Emirate's banks by a high capital adequacy ratio of 19%.</p><h4>The Appeal of Diversification</h4><p>Banca Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's largest bank by market value, is extending its corporate and investment banking footprint through branches in Abu Dhabi and Doha to ride the wave of diversification supporting key sectors. It is also the first Italian bank in the UAE operating an onshore branch. Italian banks capable of bearing the cost are themselves diversifying away from the hugely dented Italian banking sector plagued by the bad debt not seen in the UAE. Furthermore UniCredit, Intesa's closest competitor in Italy, is set to open a branch in Abu Dhabi's new financial district. Which leads us to...</p><h4>...The ADGM</h4><p>The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a financial free zone launched in 2013, is an exercise in long-term thinking as inscribed in the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, and one that has leveraged sustained economic and financial sector performance afforded by hydrocarbons. Of note, in 2016 an MoU was signed between the ADGM and the Abu Dhabi stock exchange (ADX) for cross pollination to expand the commercial appeal of the Emirate.</p><h4>No Fooling Around</h4><p>April 1, 2017 saw finalization of the merger of listed National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD: net profit of AED5.296 billion for FY2016) and First Gulf Bank (FGB: net profit AED6.03 billion for 2FY2016) into the new entity First Abu Dhabi Bank, thereby creating a true colossus. Now the largest bank in the UAE, with assets of roughly AED183 billion, the new institution alone accounts for 27% of the nation's banking sector. Moreover, it is the second-biggest bank by assets in the Middle East after Qatar's QNB. As such, it is primed to extend the UAE's financial reach and thereby foster economic growth. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, other impressive numbers include USD27 billion in equity, an MCap of USD30 billion, a tier-one capital ratio of 16.5%, and presence in 19 countries beyond the UAE itself. Despite estimated cost synergies of AED1 billion being twice the initial estimate, they are spread over three years, during which operational expenses are set to decline tangibly. In fact, confident of future profitability, the bank expects a return on equity of 16-17% by 2020. Predictably then, the shares of First Abu Dhabi Bank (traded as NBAD) had rallied more than 9% in the first week of trading on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. And meanwhile, Moody's maintained its long and short-term foreign and local currency deposit and debt ratings for NBAD at Aa3/P-1 post-merger.</p><p>Abu Dhabi's financial prestige will likely stretch further, as Bahrain's GFH and Dubai's Shuaa Capital have begun talks over a potential merger that would result in an investment bank with assets of over USD3.65 billion. Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG) is the biggest shareholder of both institutions. In short, with reforms and compliance slotting into place nicely, the local sector's future, so far as any of us can now foresee it, is secure. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/7695422f-613f-4ca3-809d-b636888c84ea.jpg","","","","","","Banking","strength-in-prudence","1413","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the project was disrupted by the 2008 global economic crisis, it is already in operation and completion of the second phase is expected in 2021.</p><p>Masdar's vision, although complex in terms of logistically implementing a low-carbon city in the middle of the desert, was simple in its objective: to accommodate Abu Dhabi's rapid urbanization while dramatically reducing that population's consumption of finite energy reserves.</p><p>The initial plans for Masdar City entailed an urban complex combining Arabic architectural features with advanced technologies to house an expected 40,000 people, besides a further 50,000 commuters by 2030. Part of the city would be powered by the sun, specifically 210,000sqm of photovoltaic panels responsible for 17,500MW-hours of clean electricity produced in the facility annually, making it the largest of its kind in the Middle East.</p><p>Epitomizing and actualizing Abu Dhabi's green ambitions, Masdar City has helped cultivate the tech-friendly image of this business and investment free zone, a center for renewable excellence. The city's nucleus hosts Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, a research-oriented university that is working on the Emirate's most advanced projects for sustainable energy generation in the region, and which graduated its first batch of PhD students in 2015. The institute also hosts its own Incubator Building, an innovation hub offering tailored-made spaces to businesses and entrepreneurs.</p><p>Masdar City offers an innovative ecosystem and has already cultivated its first projects, such as the Future Build initiative to assist architects, engineers, and contractors in identifying and sourcing green building products and materials to deliver environmental benefits, or the robotic parking technology to maximize the efficient use of space, both adopted in Masdar City's facilities. In early 2017, Masdar also presented the Eco-Villa Prototype, a one-of-a-kind housing project designed to use 72% less energy and 35% less water than existing villas in Abu Dhabi, which can also export power to the national grid when combined with rooftop photovoltaic panels.</p><p>The way that the city was built has epitomized the ambitions it was conceived in. Buildings had to be constructed with low-carbon cement and 90% recycled aluminium, and ultimately meet a minimum Estidama Pearl Building Rating (comparable to LEED Gold). This has helped to establish policies that promote low-carbon public transportation with projects to develop a metro line, a light rail transit, a group rapid transit, and cycling lanes. </p><p>Masdar City established sustainability benchmarks to ensure the delivery of measurable environmental social and economic benefits. With Masdar Institute attracting a growing number of students through initiatives such as the Young Future Energy Leaders, Masdar showcases the commercialization of research and development projects for the cities of the future. With the beginning of the project's second phase in 2017, Masdar City is consolidating the first R&amp;D cluster that is fully dedicated to renewables in the region.</p><p>The project's free zone is home to 400 companies, including multinationals such as GE, Siemens, and Mitsubishi. Masdar City was also chosen to be home to the International Renewable Energy Agency's global headquarters in a 32,000sqm facility powered by 340,000KW-hours produced on the building's rooftop panels. Located in the intersection of Abu Dhabi's trade hub comprised by Khalifa Port, Kizad, and the international airport, Masdar City's Free Zone contemplates an expansion plans evolving to grow its commercial base four-fold by 2020 and expand its leasable area by 32% per year.</p><p>Lastly, Masdar City is expected to become a pole for local tourism with an intended 2,300 visitors into the city on a weekly basis. Visitors can enjoy a 60-minute tour guide in a driverless hybrid vehicle passing through the city's most iconic architecture developments, Masdar Institute, and by the end of 2018 the My City Center Masdar Mall, an AED30 billion sustainable shopping center currently under development by Majid Al Futtaim Group. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","A decade ago, Abu Dhabi's most ambitious eco-friendly project to date set sail to lay the foundations for the world's most sustainable city, Masdar City.","","Masdar City","setting-the-standard","1295","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58f615b486b7b00ce8946aa8","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new bankruptcy law has therefore been welcomed across the board as a needed modernization of the UAE's economy. </p><p>The UAE government has been formally considering amendments to the insolvency regime since 2009, and a previous draft insolvency law was published in 2011. In broad terms, the new law entails a wider application of court-ruled bankruptcy solutions as an alternative to liquidation and covers all companies governed by the UAE Commercial Companies Law, free zone companies (with the notable exception of ADGM and DIFC), establishments, and civil companies with professional business.</p><p>The law has mandated the creation of a Financial Restructuring Committee to administer the law's application, which will work under the tutelage of the Ministry of Finance. This entity will be responsible for the application of a solvency test to measure the sufficiency of a business' assets, and a set of new procedures for a company to follow when it is faced with financial difficulties.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the new law provides troubled companies with a debt-restructuring framework. Instead of leaving no option but to bail, the law gives a chance for companies to rescue their business. The new law mandates the extension of court examinations for up to six years after the court's rule if there is approval from the creditor, and it provides a restructuring procedure for financially insolvent companies with slim chances of rescue, something that was previously impossible.</p><p>The scheme is expected to benefit commercial banks, as the possibility of bailing companies out will lower the risk of defaulting. Prior to the law, banking institutions would rather write off failing businesses than invest further resources in restructuring their debts. In 2015 alone, defaulted loans amounted to a debt loss of USD1.4 billion for UAE-based banks.</p><p>Of all the types of business that will benefit from the law, SMEs are the most welcoming. SMEs have been bearing the brunt of the absence of legislation to restructure or liquidate debts. The sector is underfunded owing to the fact that SMEs rely heavily on loans for their development, they are most prone to default on their debts when economic slowdowns arise, and in most cases are perceived as too risky to invest in by commercial banks.</p><p>The recent slump in oil prices, the cautionary approach of lenders, and the sluggish consumer consumption in the UAE in the past two years have been particularly damaging for struggling SMEs, whose growth expectations have been pulled back. This new law offers a light at the end of the tunnel, creating a more supportive environment for them to continue operating. If the law's implementation advances fruitfully, confidence in the loan market will spur venture capitals and angel investors to put their assets in a growing number of SMEs and startups. Recovery rates would be accelerated, creditors would see their investments returning faster, and reinvestments could come to become the trend in the SME funding scenario.</p><p>According to the World Bank's Doing Business Report of 2016, the UAE ranked 26th worldwide, but its ranking for winding down a business fell to 104th position with an average of 3.2 years needed to conclude a business, implying higher costs and more uncertainty for both creditors and debtors. The Bankruptcy Law promises to sever these impediments by forcing lenders to trust in fledgling businesses and by witnessing higher returns on their funding to reinvest them.</p><p>Despite the apparent benefits this new enactment will bring to the financial industry, observers still expect the actual implementation of the law to materialize with these benefits. Emirati courts still need to become acquainted with the law, to be exposed to its implications, and to rule the first cases before assessing the actual practical value of this law before it becomes business as usual. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","December 29, 2016 was a landmark day for the UAE's financial sector.

Takamul, which is Arabic for integration, is a strategic initiative designed to support innovation in Emirati individuals, businesses, and universities. Takamul directly encourages innovation and inventiveness by providing legal and financial support for international patent filing within knowledge intensive industries such as clean-tech, health and medical, ICT, and oil and gas.</p><p>Over the years Takamul has developed a reputation for reliable and successful relationships among a diverse group of Emirati innovators. In 2014, the TDC signed a partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to develop intellectual property (IP) and manage its IP portfolio. The agreement is testament to Takamul's success over the last four years in developing awareness and support for IP. ADNOC sought to take advantage of its expertise in the area to develop its own IP base within its R&amp;D department.<br>Perhaps the single-largest monetary investment in the knowledge-based economy to date is the Emirates Science, Technology and Innovation Higher Policy, which allocates over AED300 billion across 100 initiatives to promote growth within sectors such as education, health, energy, transportation, space, and water. The policy mandates the establishment of funds for science, research, and innovation in the UAE to encourage the growth of an organic knowledge economy based on technology transfer, intellectual property, and global industrial partnerships. The policy, in coordination with other efforts across the UAE, has set the target for knowledge workers to constitute 40% of the national labor force by 2021.</p><p>In December 2016 the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) annual conference mirrored the demands and expectations, focusing on “the Role of Financial Markets in Building an Economy Based on Knowledge, Innovation, and Happiness.“ Similarly, the aviation industry's growth in recent years is testament to changing attitudes, developing a world-class center for aviation manufacturing in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Renewable energy is also a major focus of Abu Dhabi's plan for a sustainable future and a diversified economy. In 2016 the UAE was the first Middle Eastern country to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, signifying a major shift in the UAE from a traditionally oil-based economy toward more sustainable business practices. The Minister of Energy announced that by 2030 it wants 30% of its power generation to come from clean energy. Four nuclear power plants, each with a capacity of 1,400MW, are expected to be fully operational by 2020. The remainder of its clean energy will come from solar energy.</p><p>While there are several private companies already making waves in the renewable energy market, the government is also interested in the sector. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is one of the largest single-site strategic solar energy projects in the world. This shift in focus is coming at the perfect time as the interest in renewable energy is at its peak following COP21 and, more importantly, continually sluggish prices in the commodity market are turning idle eyes away from oil.</p><p>Abu Dhabi is making massive strides in its effort to establish a diversified and knowledge-based economy. The government is laying the groundwork to support the 21st century's shift away from oil and electricity fueled by gas and in doing so is enthusiastically investing in young Emiratis' education and the fields of research and innovation. On that back of events such as the Takamul Defense Innovation and Technology Conference (DITEC) in 2015, when international specialists in areas such as science, technology, and innovation were gathered in Abu Dhabi, creating a platform for discussion and progress within the industry, Abu Dhabi's public and private sector are engaging with the knowledge economy and making it a reality. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge Economy","turning-the-ship-around","1352","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-13T07:16:00.000Z","2017-09-13T07:16:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Business Climate","<p>The green economy is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the Gulf region, and nowhere is the concept of environmental friendliness stronger than in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Its natural resources include 16 habitat types, nine of which are terrestrial and seven marine. Abu Dhabi's environment is characterized by desert in the central and western regions, rugged terrain in the south, alluvial plains in the east, while salt flats, sand dunes, and sheets with shrub cover along its coast. Home to 432 plant species, 51 mammal species, 427 bird species, 54 reptile and amphibian species, 456 types of fish, and 2,219 terrestrial invertebrate, Abu Dhabi is exceptionally diverse. Emerging to preserve its unique geography and wildlife is the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi (EAD), established in 1996. The governmental entity's 1,100 employees, 65% of whom are Emirati nationals, are leading the charge to protect and manage biodiversity, maintain a clean environment, and promote sustainable development. At present, EAD has monitoring programs in place for 24 key species in nine habitats, with the goal to improve its ability to systematically identify any changes in the Emirate's biodiversity. The agency is actively working to increase terrestrial protected areas from 10% in 2015 to 16% in 2020, supporting the conservation of various species. The agency also has aims to adjust the local sustainable fisheries exploitation index from 13% to 20% over the same timeframe.</p><p>Under its 2016-2020 framework, the EAD's extensive plans are expected to revolutionize the green economy in a variety of areas. Specifically, the organization is working to address the unsustainable use of groundwater, protect air and water quality, prepare for the local impact of climate change, improve waste infrastructure, and prevent land pollution and soil degradation. The entity is also actively working to raise environmental awareness, thereby ensuring that environmental issues remain a top priority on the national agenda. By partnering with other government entities, the private sector, NGOs, and global environmental agencies, the EAD is striving to embrace international best practices and use innovation to institute effective policy measures.</p><p>One such partner entityis the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI). “In order to maintain our quality of life we must monitor and manage our environment,"" Ahmed Abdulmuttaleb Baharnoon, Acting Director of AGEDI, told TBY. “In that sense, data is fundamental to our understanding the state of and trends within the environment. The design of policy requires an extensive understanding of the way the environment works and interacts with our social and economic systems, and that knowledge derives from research and monitoring.""</p><h4>WHAT ABOUT WATER</h4><p>As the world's most precious resource, water has come into focus as a key challenge for Abu Dhabi going forward. Recent statistics point to the fact that Abu Dhabi's water supply is dwindling rapidly, with some specifying that the Emirate needs to invest at least USD2 billion into water desalination over the next five years in order to keep up with demand.</p><p>The EAD has responded by setting achievable targets to decrease water consumption, while other public and private operators in the sector are committed to educating the local population regarding water usage. As part of the targets for 2016-2020, the EAD is aiming to reduce the total volume of groundwater extracted annually from 2.2 million cbm to 1.82 million cbm. As well, the plan will contribute toward increasing the amount of usable groundwater reserves and reducing the volume of groundwater used in agriculture. Concurrently, the EAD is working to reduce or at least maintain groundwater salinity levels and recycle water where possible, and encourage the reduction of water used in forestry by 28% for 2020.  In an interview with TBY, Alan Thomson, Managing Director of Abu Dhabi Sewerage Services Company (ADSSC) said, “Most people do not think too hard about the utilities they use, including water. We still have an important role to play in conveying to people that water is a limited resource and that its usage has a huge impact on the environment.""</p><h4>PUBLICLY GREEN</h4><p>In a visionary move, the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) issued the region's first “green"" bond for a total of US587 million. The five-year bond is set to be listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2017, priced at a spread of 98 basis points over mid-swaps, and pay a coupon of 3% annually. NBAD's bond sets a record at approximately 72% larger than average corporate or government green bonds issued in 2016.</p><p>Under the premise of supporting the green economy, the bond must abide by certain environmental guidelines known as the “green bond principles,"" established by the International Capital Market Association. Two of the projects directly supported by the bond are being undertaken in the UAE: the 100MW Shams concentrated solar power plant in Abu Dhabi and the Etihad Rail network.</p><p>Feeding into the growing stream of public institutions that support the green economy is Abu Dhabi's UAE University (UAEU), where a team of scientists has developed a new type of material from agricultural waste that can be used as building insulation. The project's innovative solution demonstrates one of many viable ways to provide energy savings to make insulation from agricultural waste. According to the head of the project, recycling agricultural waste is cost effective, requires less energy to make, and is more environmentally friendly than using traditional polymer derived from crude oil.</p><h4>PRIVATELY GREEN</h4><p>Private-sector players ranging from waste management to real estate and construction companies and biofuels producers are also stepping up to support Abu Dhabi in achieving its green goals.<br>Recently, the Park Hyatt Abu Dhabi Hotel and Villas was awarded the prestigious LEED certificate for its resource efficiency. In line with the wider 2016-2020 plan, the hotel uses significantly less water and energy, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions overall. The hotel developer is also a pioneer in terms of designing infrastructure for green initiatives such as specialized irrigation that reduces landscape water consumption by 50% through the creation of dry wadi beds, as well as the planting of native vegetation that complements the local climate.</p><p>Dubbed the “world's most sustainable eco-city,"" Masdar City is another pioneer in the push toward eco-friendly solutions. Since construction began in 2008, Masdar City has grown to encompass 6sqkm and has already become a hub for leading green technology companies such as Siemens. It is also home to the global headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), one of the world's key environmental watchdogs. Buildings in Masdar City have proven to be 72% more energy efficient than traditional concrete structures, with tests showing that its energy consumption also outperforms the vast majority of modern housing by 45%. In addition, solar panels on the city's eco-villa homes generate enough energy over the course of a year to effectively run without drawing any energy from Abu Dhabi's main power grid.<br>Masdar City has already begun to draw attention from global investors. In early 2017, top executives from both Etihad Airways and Boeing visited a unique integrated seawater and agriculture system facility in Masdar City—the world's first project that combines seawater and natural aquaculture fertilizer to grow plant biomass that can be converted into aviation biofuel. Demonstrating its futuristic vision, Masdar acquired a 25% stake in Hywind Scotland, the world's first offshore floating wind farm, in 1Q2017. The farm is a 30MW pilot project floating off the northeast coast of Scotland. Hywind Scotland is Masdar's JV with Norway's Statoil, which holds a 75% stake. Saudi Aramco also signed a MoU with Masdar in April 2017. Under the guidelines of the agreement, Masdar and Saudi Aramco are due to collaborate on sustainable development and renewable energy, which will yield considerable advancements in terms of clean electricity generation, reducing carbon emissions in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the world at large.</p><p>Tadweer, Abu Dhabi's privately run center of waste management, is looking at leftover cooking oil, grease, and fat collected from kitchens across the Emirate as a source for producing biodiesel under a new recycling scheme. The company will provide the permits needed for small businesses to be able to produce the environmentally friendly alternative to regular diesel for use in buses and trucks. Already commonplace in Dubai, the reuse of cooking oil is expected to gain traction in Abu Dhabi over the short term. Generally, Tadweer is building and implementing integrated waste management and pest control systems, with the higher aim of converting all waste into valuable economic resources. The company's ambitions fall into line with EAD's intention of decreasing the amount of municipal waste produced per capita per day from 1.9kg in 2015 to 1.5kg in 2020. The collaboration between public and private entities will be vital toward the development of integrated waste plans. As EAD improves the Emirate's waste regulatory framework and ensures effective enforcement and widens the availability of waste management data, Abu Dhabi will benefit from greater awareness and education regarding waste reduction, reuse, and recycling.</p><h4>ECO-FUTURE</h4><p>Looking ahead, it will be paramount to raise awareness and disseminate key information to the local community regarding sustainability. At the same time, attracting investors to green opportunities is expected to take precedence. The EAD has laid out a quantifiable target to increase stakeholder environmental awareness from 71% to 82% by 2020; through its work with both the governmental and private sectors, the EAD is on track to promote and encourage resource efficiency. Another key factor going forward will be to ensure that the right educational initiatives are in place to create the appropriate green economy workforce. To that end, the government is working on specific environmental outreach programs and education activities that speak to some of the EAD's strategic priorities. For many sustainable initiatives, maintaining low employee turnover rates, as well as attracting, developing, and retaining qualified and high-performing staff, will be crucial for long-term success. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/17592653-5c54-46d5-9002-0482d03a9260.jpg","","","","Over USD163 billion is being allocated toward renewable energy projects in the UAE.

"2017-09-13T06:46:00.000Z","2017-09-13T06:46:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Sea Change","<p>Since the steep drop in oil prices in 2014, the UAE and other countries in the GCC have had to face the reality that revenue from petroleum can no longer sustain the national economy. This is not to say that the UAE has been caught unaware. There has been a long-term push to diversify the economy with strategic initiatives like Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030, which serves as a roadmap for pulling the private sector into alignment with the long-term goals of the Emirate. Despite these efforts, the UAE needs a new source of revenue to finance its budget, thus 2018 will mark a pivotal point in the country's history with the new 5% VAT being implemented on January 1, 2018.</p><p>The decision to implement a VAT in tandem with other GCC states comes after several organizations, including the IMF, raised flags over the capacity for oil rents to cover the budget deficit since oil prices began to slide in 2014. The MENA region has been hit hard by the price drop, with these countries collectively losing USD340 billion in oil revenue in 2015, accounting for 20% of the region's GDP. The UAE in particular has seen a drop in government revenue from oil, slipping from 41% of GDP in 2013 to 29% of GDP in 2015. Despite this, the UAE maintains its provision of public services to nationals and expatriates alike, with state spending rising 4% during the same period. As such the Emirates are looking to the 5% VAT to finance the gap. </p><p>Government proponents see VAT as the right move for filling the void, as corporate tax is not on the agenda as many fear it would disincentivize businesses. This would be antithetical to the vision for a competitive and diversified economy that Abu Dhabi is so firmly committed to.</p><p>The UAE was ranked 12th in the world by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, ahead of 22 EU members, with special recognition given for the excellent tax environment. The UAE is known for its zero direct tax policy, which will be unaffected by the VAT, an indirect tax.</p><p>Critics, however, argue that as a consumption tax it encourages saving over spending. This is significant for low-income earners that do not have the capacity to avoid the tax by reducing spending, often living paycheck to paycheck. These individuals end up paying a higher proportion of their income to the VAT. By comparison, high earners tend to spend far less than they earn, and are therefore taxed on a far smaller proportion of their income. In the face of vast income inequality in Abu Dhabi, this could become a contentious issue by aggravating the existing income gaps. </p><p>To combat this effect, the Ministry of Finance announced exemptions designed to protect low-income earners. The list of products and services that will not be eligible for the VAT includes 100 food items, mostly staple foods, as well as social services, healthcare, and education services. </p><p>As it stands, the expected revenue is optimistic, with the UAE set to collect more than any other GCC state implementing the tax. The Ministry of Financial Affairs expects the VAT to generate AED12 billion in the first year, accounting for 2.1% of GDP. This amount is expected to reach AED18 to 20 billion by the second year.<br>With the law coming to effect in 2018, the government is beginning to raise awareness, educating businesses and individuals on how to prepare to comply with the tax, and how to prepare for the effects of the policy. It is unclear whether this will serve as a solution to the revenue problem as the UAE steps away from the hydrocarbon economy; however, a VAT represents a solid first step in preparing for a future without oil. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","History will look back on the current period as the end an era of government dependency on oil wealth, and by that hand the end of the Gulf as a global tax haven.","","VAT","a-sea-change-uae-abu-dhabi-2017","1364","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-13T06:22:00.000Z","2017-09-13T06:22:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Little Sparta To the Rescue","<p>Dubbed by American Defense Secretary James “Mad Dog“ Mattis as “little Sparta,“ the UAE has had one of the most active, and by many accounts successful, foreign policies of any country on the planet in the past decade. Measured by per-capita punch, it is certainly one of the most ambitious. In addition to its impressive 98 diplomatic missions across the world (or one for every 14,000 Emirati citizens), its military effervescence has been no less conspicuous.</p><p>Far from a passive, indifferent commercial outpost on the Arabian Gulf, the UAE now has military bases on the Horn of Africa, the southern rim of Arabia, the mouth of the Red Sea as far north as Eritrea, and deep into the Mediterranean, from Benghazi (Libya) to Limassol (Cyprus). At no time since pre-Napoleonic Venice has such a small but pivotal power held such influence.</p><p>For starters, the question and quest for Emirati influence is a bit of an anomalous one: the UAE is liberal and tolerant while retaining strong Islamic values—scarcely a comparison can be made in recent world history to its unique international position. Trapped between hyper-modernity and a hard place, the UAE cannot afford to let ideology get in the way of its policies. Hence its perusal of what one expert on the Gulf calls its “Jeffersonian“ foreign policy: the strict division of church and state in the pursuance of regional objectives.</p><p>This sets the country apart from its closest counterpart, Qatar, another petro-power that has taken up its own cross across the region, but with far more clearly defined goals: the rise to power of soft-Sunni political Islam. Contrary to Doha, which has often clashed with its neighbors over certain facets of its foreign policy, the Emirates' objectives are not only more measured, but far more pragmatic.</p><p>The key to Abu Dhabi's approach is two-fold: remain non-sectarian and un-ideological in scope and protect ports, sea lanes, open airspace, and maritime trade routes taking precedence over any and all doctrinal considerations.</p><p>Abu Dhabi is at the center of the UAE, with its ruler always acting as President of the UAE. HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan is the President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, while HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, is also a significant figure and active on the diplomatic scene.</p><h4>The Carrot is In the Cake</h4><p>Though host to some of the largest ports in the Middle East, including Abu Dhabi's Khalifa Port, the UAE is not immune to competition. Significant expansion at neighboring ports in Chabahar (Iran) and Duqm (Oman), not to mention the construction of King Abdullah Economic City on the Red Sea in Jeddah (Saudi), means that virtually all of its neighbors are vying for a larger piece of the global trade pie. Inevitably, if not intentionally, variations in regional trade volumes are somewhat zero-sum, and the UAE's aggressive foreign policy stems at least in part from these fears. </p><p>To contain these threats, Abu Dhabi has a pragmatic approach: internationally, it must manage, if not stabilize, regional security through military consolidation and nimble enough diplomacy to avoid ruffling the feathers of other powerful players in the region. If there's a single political narrative to this strategy, it is the rollback of political Islam across the Gulf, Levant, and North Africa.</p><p>In pursuit of this, it has supported militarily efforts against Houthi rebels in Yemen, keeping the country's significant ports open and friendly. Further south on the Horn of Africa, Abu Dhabi is backing rebels in Puntland and Somaliland in their efforts to break away from Mogadishu. In return—or as part and parcel of this process—the UAE is funding Puntland's Maritime Police Force and bolstering its acquisition of the Berbera port along Somaliland's coast as part of its securitization of the region's most critical waterways.</p><p>An ancient Red Sea harbor that once marked the southernmost tip of the Ottoman Empire, Berbera is now under contract with DP World, a shipping behemoth that sprung out of the 2005 merger of Dubai Ports Authority and Dubai Ports International and now controls 77 terminals across the globe. And Berbera is far more than a military-map vanity project; plans are afoot to build a Kempinski hotel and solar power stations—all in addition to the 25-year lease on air and naval bases the deal included, which amounts to virtually the “first economic recognition of [the] tiny republic,“ as The Economist quoted one ecstatic Somaliland politician putting it.</p><h4>Money Where Your Mouth Is</h4><p>The mastermind behind the UAE's foreign policy is Abu Dhabi and, more specifically, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. Son of the late founding father of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, His Highness graduated from Sandhurst before enrolling as an officer in the UAE's armed forces, where he primarily served as an air force pilot. Since then, he has transformed the UAE into the third-largest arms importer in the world with an estimated military budget of USD23.5 billion in 2016.</p><p>Yemen, where its troops are most tied up, has so far been a rather mixed bag. On the one hand, the war that kicked off in early 2015 and since become known as one of the darker and less comprehensible horses of the contemporary world's never-ending conflicts has met with complications. The capital of Sana'a, despite the continuous shelling the city has received, has yet to fall from Houthi control.</p><p>But this emboldened military presence has also reflected on domestic policy, with HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan taking the unprecedented step of introducing military conscription. For a supremely prosperous country, there is a longstanding fear amongst elders that young Emirati men have grown too cossetted to defend their country's prosperity. </p><p>In this regard, the air, naval, and ground campaign in Yemen provides a perfect opportunity to right more than several wrongs: to make men of boys; create a greater bond of national solidarity across socio-economically disparate Emirates; increase reverence and respect for the state; gain vital military experience; and put society on an equal war-footing with regional friends, rivals, and possible future foes. After all, in a region experiencing tectonic shifts in its politico-military balance of powers—and possibly once-in-a-generation socio-ideological reconfigurations—it pays to stand ready.</p><h4>Muslim, Moderate, and Modern</h4><p>But Abu Dhabi also stands tall in the world of ideas. As the UAE ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, wrote in a recent piece, his country's mission in the region and world at large is to be “a path guided by the true tenets of Islam: respect, inclusion, and peace.“ This is a vision that “empowers women, embraces diversity, encourages innovation, and welcomes global engagement,“ Otaiba wrote, and is already being put into place in the UAE, where Amal Al Qubaisi was recently made president of the country's Federal National Council and is the first woman in region to lead a national council. In addition to the opening of the country's largest Indian Orthodox Church and the restoration and reopening of St Andrews Cathedral, the government also donated land for the construction of the Emirates' third Hindu temple in 2015. </p><p>Setting out to establish a strong, capable, and accountable post-carbon economy “driven by innovation, human capital, rule of law, and open trade,“ the country is also working in conjunction with NASA to develop the UAE Space Agency to the extent that it can put a probe around Mars by 2021. As part of the Emirate's broader goal of demonstrating that it is possible to be “Muslim, moderate, and modern“ without batting an eye, the Mars probe is hoped to be a source of inspiration for an entire generation of Emirati and Arab youth—a Kennedian “moon shot“ for the 21st century Gulf. </p><p>Whether social, intellectual, or diplomatic, Abu Dhabi's impact is also making itself felt on this planet. In addition to the much-publicized opening of satellite campuses of NYU, the Sorbonne, and INSEAD, not to mention branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim, Abu Dhabi recently launched the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, a well-respected think tank that is fast becoming the primary source of intelligence, analysis, scholarship, and commentary on the America-GCC relationship. On a more philosophical level, Abu Dhabi has also contributed greatly to various international deradicalization efforts, giving bedrock support to peace-building bodies such as the Global Counterterrorism Forum, supporting the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, and hosting the Muslim Council of Elders and the Global Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies. In conjunction with the US, it also launched the Sawab Center, a global digital platform dedicated to countering violent, radical, and nihilist ideologies, beginning with but not restricted to Daesh.</p><p>Whatever the tensions in its immediate backyard, the UAE has been working tirelessly to ensure that major players such as Iran not only respect the norms that make international life agreeable, but become fruitful partners at the same table. This is why the UAE not only worked tirelessly to see the successful implementation of JCPOA, but has also stressed how the UAE's own successful nuclear energy program, launched in 2009, might serve as a model for other carbon-dependent nations such as Iran going forward. In addition to promoting peaceful energy policies, Abu Dhabi remains as committed to the regional security paradigms that ensure that neither security, nor integration, nor mutually beneficial development are neglected. For this reason it joined the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) launched during NATO's Istanbul Summit in 2004 as part of that body's strengthening of political, economic, and military ties with critical countries across the greater Middle East, of which the UAE is a crucial one. In addition to its active participation in ICI, the Emirate has also particularly strengthened its ties with France, the UK, and South Korea. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/54ef68eb-96c9-4844-b170-0c66f02ade75.jpg","","","","","","","little-sparta-to-the-rescue","1465","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-13T06:15:00.000Z","2017-09-13T06:15:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","On the road to equality","<p>The Statistics Centre of Abu Dhabi (SCAD) estimates that 70% of university students in the UAE are women. According to SCAD'ss Emirati Women, Past and Present 2016 report, women account for 73% of the public sector's employee base and young female entrepreneurs represent 10% of the 20,000 people working in the country's dynamic startup and SME ecosystem</p><p>Emirati women have penetrated the most unlikely industries for gender parity. In finance, a still largely male-dominated sector around the globe, Emirati women lead the likelihood of occupying positions in the banking and financial services after graduation with a 29% ratio against an 11% for their male counterparts. In sectors such as nuclear energy and medical physics, the UAE reached 50-50 gender parity in 2016. Things also look promising for women in aeronautical engineering and space technologies, where they currently represent the majority of the workforce in the country. </p><p>Strata Manufacturing, the leading aerospace manufacturer in the UAE, states that women make up 86% of its workforce. Even in the oil and gas industry, traditionally the most uneven for gender equality, ADNOC's new leadership established a gender parity agenda that includes appointing women in least 15% of its senior management positions, increasing the number of Emirati women recruits to 30% by 2020, and appointing at least one female CEO at the helm of one of its subsidiaries.</p><p>The country's leadership, however, acknowledges that challenges remain hefty. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap, the Middle East still has a parity distance of 39% between men and women, making it the largest gap in the world. It also still lags behind on the overall economic participation with a 42 to 92 women to men ratio. The gender income gap and the still timid role of women in managerial positions pose the biggest challenges for the UAE in its quest for gender equality.</p><p>The response to these challenges, nonetheless, has been outlined in the country's plans for the years ahead. The UAE has the target of becoming one of the top 25 countries for gender equality by the time it celebrates its 50th anniversary as a nation in 2021. This journey facilitated the creation of the UAE Gender Balance Council (GBC) in May 2015, aimed at enhancing the country's efforts in driving women's participation in national development. Part of the body's 2017 agenda involves three core initiatives to enhance gender balance: documenting the efforts of supporting bodies through the UAE Gender Balance Seal, the implementation of the UAE Gender Balance Order, and the establishment of the Best Three UAE Gender Balance Initiatives Award. An integral part of the GBC also includes measuring the extent to which government entities provide a friendly and supportive environment for working mothers.</p><p>This rights-enhancing framework led to an unprecedented increase of female representation at the 2016 Federal National Council elections, moving from 17.5% to 22.5%, and a 27.5% female representation in the cabinet. Moreover, the elections were marked by the historic appointment of Dr. Amal Al Qubaisi as President of the Council, making her the first woman to occupy such a position not only in the history of the UAE, but of the entire Arab world. She is accompanied by other eight other women occupying key senior positions in the Emirati government.</p><p>The leaps carried by the UAE in the past years have even caught the attention of the UN. The international body chose Abu Dhabi to open the first office of UN Women, its entity working for female empowerment, in the Arab region. Today, the UAE stands at the best time in its history to reach gender equality. The challenges remain huge but the opportunities stand taller than them. Never before have Emirati women had the power to transform their own nation. Only time will tell how gender parity will transform the social thread of the UAE. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Today the UAE stands as a beacon in the fight for female empowerment in the Gulf. The country has adopted an inclusive agenda to further integrate women into the highest levels of management in public and private entities, rewritten part of its legislation to reorient it toward gender equality, and designed programs to foster the creativity of a growing number of female entrepreneurs.","","Female Empowerment","on-the-road-to-equality","1288","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As of April 2016, the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (CAD) ranked the UAE first on the official development aid to gross national income index, with a total AED16 billion deployed in capacity-building programs around the globe. The UAE's efforts to fund projects beyond its borders have positioned the country at the top of the international donor ladder.</p><p>One of the most innovative initiatives has been the UAE-Pacific Partnership, a funding project targeting 11 Pacific islands (Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu) through the provision of USD50 million in grants for energy renewable projects. The project was launched on the occasion of a Pacific Leaders Meeting held in Abu Dhabi by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in 2012. The partnership entails the deployment of funds to shortlisted projects aimed at supporting the islands' ambitions to guarantee energy sustainability and reduce overdependence on fuel imports, while utilizing it as a key growth enabler.</p><p>The fund was designed to accommodate diverse project types, including single, stand-alone projects, bundles of smaller projects, and components of larger projects with other investors and donors. The feasibility studies for the generation capacity, as well as operation and maintenance capacity building programs, were included in the grant. Masdar, the UAE's renewable energy arm, would act as project developer, and quality local contractors would be given preference.</p><p>The project was comprised of two cycles: the first one for bids submitted between 2013 and 2014, and the second for the 2015-2016 period. The first projects that were approved were solar projects in Fiji, Kiribati, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, and a wind turbine in Samoa. By early 2017, all the total 11 projects will be fulfilled, adding a total of 6.5MW of renewable energy capacity to all the islands, and eliminating 8,447 tons of CO2 emissions per annum, reducing over 3 million liters of imported diesel, and saving up to USD3.7 million in fuel expenses per annum.</p><p>The project involved multiple Emirati agencies, with Masdar as project developer, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development the funder, and the ministries of foreign affairs of each nation overlooking the allocation of funds and works, as well as the World Bank and the Pacific Environment Community Fund, which coordinated part of the projects developed in Kiribati and Tuvalu.</p><p>Ever since its foundation back in 2006, Masdar has functioned as the operating arm for renewable energy projects for the government of Abu Dhabi, inside and outside the country. In those 10 years, Abu Dhabi, through Masdar, has become the largest exporter of clean energies in the Middle East with investments amounting USD2.7 billion and projects deployed across the UK, Spain, Oman, Jordan, Mauritania, Egypt, Morocco, and the Seychelles. The UAE-Pacific Partnership is the latest effort to promote the use of renewable energies and replicate the expertise gained in the UAE in other markets.</p><p>The renewable energy project has been followed by more business opportunities for Abu Dhabi. In November 2016, President Jioji Konrote of Fiji travelled to Abu Dhabi to meet the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, both agreeing that business delegations from Abu Dhabi should travel to the Pacific island to explore opportunities in education, energy, and tourism. Local news outlets reported that the Crown Prince asked for more information on a rebuilding program for schools damaged by tropical cyclone Winston, and discussed the chance to offer scholarships to Fijian students to study in the UAE. </p><p>Fiji already benefits from the UAE Pacific Partnership Fund with solar power projects in Lakeba, Kaduva, and Rotuma, helping the country save more than half a million dollars annually on fuel imports. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Through Masdar, the government of Abu Dhabi has fast become one of the biggest exporters of green expertise in the Middle East, and is developing projects across a number of Pacific islands.","","UAE-Pacific Partnership","the-green-beyond","1365","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GDP growth in 2017 is expected to be between 3 and 5% according to the UAE government, and growth rates could even accelerate if the global economy continues to expand. Due to declining oil prices, consumer spending had been trending downward, but there are indications across the market that confidence is returning and consumption is accelerating. Inflation has remained moderate, reaching between 3 and 4% in 2016.</p><p>According to the Statistics Center of Abu Dhabi (SCAD), the Emirate's economy outpaced the country as a whole, growing by more than 7.7% in 4Q2016 compared to the same period in 2014. According to the most recently available data from SCAD, the Emirate's GDP is around AED960.1 billion, and the oil sector accounted for more than 50% of that. The value of oil, gas, and oil product exports sat at around AED185.2 billion, while the value of non-oil exports was around AED30.8 billion. The economy imported around AED119.3 billion worth of goods, while the re-export figure was AED18.8 billion. In 2016, the economy included 86,672 newly registered or renewed businesses, and the inflation rate was 2%. According to SCAD, around 83.3% of the Emirate's population participates in the labor force, though only 21.4% of the women participate in the workforce. The unemployment level is relatively low, currently sitting at 3.7%.</p><p>Standard &amp; Poor's estimates that the Emirate will post a budget surplus of 4.5% between 2018 and 2020, thanks in large part to increases in global oil prices, a new VAT tax, and taxes on hotels and expatriates, according to The National. S&amp;P currently rates Abu Dhabi's sovereign debt at AA/A-1 with a stable outlook, noting that the Emirate has a robust fiscal position, large currency reserves, and an estimated GDP per capita of USD75,000 in 2017. S&amp;P expects that real GDP growth will hover at around 2.7% in the next few years as oil production returns to previous levels and approaches the Emirate's production capacity of 4 million barrels. Moody's has also revised its outlook for the government of Abu Dhabi from negative to stable, and cited the government's effective fiscal responses to declines in the oil sector, its commitment to economic reform, a renewed growth outlook for the broader economy, and a robust banking system.</p><p>Fiscal reform has allowed the government to reduce its expenditure burden by nearly 23% over the last two years, according to Moody's. Thanks to Abu Dhabi's efforts to rein in spending and implement reforms, the Emirate's fiscal deficit is projected to drop to 2% of GDP by the end of 2017 and to fall even lower in 2018, approaching a mere 0.3% of GDP in 2018. Additionally, Moody's expected the Emirate's overall debt to fall below 8% of GDP by 2018. Thanks to a hefty fiscal buffer in the form of the country's sovereign wealth assets, which Moody's estimates is nearly 200% of the Emirate's GDP, Abu Dhabi and the country are expected to be more than capable of handling most unforeseen economic shocks.</p><p>Reduction in government spending does, however, have the potential to slow the Emirate's efforts to diversify its economy away from oil and gas. Moody's has forecast that non-oil real GDP growth will drop to 1.9% in 2017. This is a far cry from the impressive 8.6% growth in real non-oil GDP the Emirate recorded in 2014, and the decline is due in large part to reductions in government expenditures, slowing growth in real estate investment, and falling goods export numbers. While non-performing loans have risen, Moody's expects that the banking sector's underlying strengths will allow the sector to thrive in coming years. </p><p>The success of the Emirate and the country in diversifying the economic base has insulated the UAE from dramatic price shocks in the global market. According to HSBC, non-oil exports and commodity trading have grown by double digits in recent years. Tourism and real estate have also been important counterbalances to falling oil prices. There are some concerns among analysts, however, that the government's attempts to rein in fiscal outlays might signal a cooling interest in infrastructure and real estate projects. If government spending continues to dry up, construction projects may have to be shelved.</p><p>Diversification has long been a key part of Abu Dhabi's economic plan, and the Emirate's Economic Vision 2030 lays out an ambitious roadmap for achieving it. Through various programs aimed at developing productivity and competitiveness, human capital, and physical and financial capital, Abu Dhabi is trying to stimulate sustainable economic development and economic stability. According to Vision 2030, the Emirate hopes to stabilize growth at 6% a year in order to develop a diverse economic foundation that can weather future uncertainties in the oil market. By 2030, Abu Dhabi hopes to have 64% of its GDP coming from non-oil economic activity. With a clear plan in place for the Emirate's economic future, Abu Dhabi is in the midst of transforming itself into a cutting-edge economy, complete with strong industries across a wide variety of sectors.</p><p>Tourism in Abu Dhabi is expected to grow, too, adding yet another important source of non-oil GDP growth to the Emirate. After posting 8% growth in 2016, officials in the Emirate are trying to record similarly impressive rates in 2017 by focusing on China and India, two key markets global tourism. According to the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority, more than 4.4 million tourists stayed in Abu Dhabi hotels, and the average stay was 2.73 nights. Nearly 24.5 million passengers traveled through Abu Dhabi International Airport in 2016, representing more than 5% growth from the previous year. With nearly 300 direct flights between Abu Dhabi and India every week, officials hope to leverage this heavy traffic into increased tourism numbers. According to The National, Abu Dhabi currently has around 30,000 hotel rooms and 169 hotel and hotel apartments, and there are plans to increase the hotel infrastructure by roughly 10,000 rooms in the next five years. </p><p>As the government of Abu Dhabi has worked to diversify its economy, it has developed a plan to rely on and support its SME sector. The Emirate's 2016-2020 industrial strategy seeks to enable the private sector and create long-term economic linkages between larger industrial entities and SMEs, according to Abu Dhabi's Department of Economic Development. The Emirate recognizes that a sustainable economic growth model must include a healthy SME sector. Leaders in both private industry and the public sector are trying to stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation in industries traditionally dominated by large firms. As Abu Dhabi tries to expand its industrial base to 10% of GDP and boost the non-oil sector's share of GDP to 40%, the government has identified SMEs as a core catalyst in this transformation. Recent economic headwinds hit SMEs harder then other firms, and Abu Dhabi responded by loosening certain banking regulations in order to prop up wavering firms. The change in regulation was also seen as a more long-term structural shift focused on moving more economic emphasis onto the smaller domestic firms that make up the backbone of the economy. Additionally, this shift is a key priority of the country's Economic Vision 2030, which calls for enlarging the enterprise base and enhancing competitiveness.</p><p>As part of a nationwide strategy for raising government revenue, the Emirate is going to implement a new set of taxes in the coming year. A 5% VAT tax will be introduced throughout the GCC, and excise duties on sodas and sports drinks, tobacco, and a collection of other products will be introduced in the coming months, according to The National. Excise taxes have the potential to be 100% of the value of effected goods. As the government seeks to establish new revenue channels to offset declines in the oil and gas sector, many new and different taxation schemes are being weighed. Government and private industry are, however, working in concert to develop a plan that increases revenue without unduly burdening growth or retarding innovation. Tax structures in the Emirate have been a topic of concern for investors and consumers, and stakeholders across Abu Dhabi are trying to develop a revenue system that is forward-looking and sustainable. While there has been talk of a new corporate tax, there has yet to be any meaningful movement towards implementation or development. Certain government officials and leaders in the business community are, however, wary of such a tax, as they fear that new corporate taxes might force companies out of Abu Dhabi, thereby undermining the Emirate's accomplishments in diversification and development.</p><p>Government spending has also increased in recent months, indicating that recovery and growth may be speeding up. Spending projects totaling AED7 billion are in the pipeline, and expenditures will be directed toward large tourism projects. According to the Department of Economic Development, Abu Dhabi attracted more than AED95 billion worth of investment in 2016, 8% more than in 2015. While real estate has been a major destination for investment, the Emirate is trying to increase investment in finance and hospitality. Industry leaders and analysts are confident that as government spending picks up, strong growth will return quickly. Currently, the government is focused on developing a growth plan that creates long-term development while simultaneously generating funds for necessary projects. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/022951b7-ebbd-4c74-82ef-a8db0cb2ad02.jpg","","","","Though low oil prices hit Abu Dhabi hard in 2014 and 2015, the Emirate's impressive economic diversification insulated it against the worst and illustrated the wisdom of aggressively expanding its non-oil economy.","","","growing-strong","1702","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2017-09-07T07:57:00.000Z","2017-09-07T07:57:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Doing Business in Colombia","<p>The world's 26th-largest country by landmass and 29th by population, Colombia ranked 53rd in the World Bank's ease of doing business category for 2017. Down two positions from 2016, this was largely because of difficulties that many firms have in paying taxes, which, contrary to the government's hopes, have not been made easier since the fiscal reforms introduced in January 2017. As a result, the country dropped a further six spots, from the 133rd hardest place to pay taxes to the 139th, nothing to write home about.</p><p>To be sure, it made significant progress in other areas, such as the ease of starting a business, where it climbed nearly 20 places from 80th to 61st in the span of one year alone, or maintained its dominance in others such as access to credit, where it remained the second-best place to do business in the world. This almost makes up for the fact that the country slipped a few places in: protecting minority investors, from 10th to 13th; trading across borders, from 118th to 121st; and getting electricity, from 69th to 74th.<br>That businesses are having great difficulty in the most basic regards—keeping the lights on and knowing how much to fork over to the state—reflects the chronic political, economic, and infrastructural deficiencies that have plagued the Colombian state for ages, especially when decades of war have bloated the size of the state and a recent overreliance on hydrocarbons for its revenues now forces it to lean on the private sector to make up the slack for depressed energy prices. On the other hand, the ready access to capital and protection of minority investors reflect the investment community's ultimate faith in the country's capacity to grow in leaps and bounds in the post-conflict era, not to mention the government's determination to assure it has the necessary legal protections to actually do so.</p><p>Though rightly touted for having one of the most disciplined fiscal regimes in Latin American history, Colombia has struggled since the 1990s to keep its house in order. Thus a new era was born, in October 2016, when Colombia's congress overwhelmingly passed a series of reforms to raise the VAT from 16% to 19% (excluding basic items like food and medication), gradually lower income tax on businesses from 43% to 33% by 2019 (though companies operating in the free zone regime will only pay 20%), and stiffly increase penalties on tax evasion. There is also an increase in the tax on increases in the value of a taxpayer's assets from 3 to 3.5%.<br>Other tax hikes include: the introduction of a “green“ tax on fuels and other oil-derived energy products; a 15% withholding rate on taxable income accrued by non-residents without a permanent establishment; a long-term capital gains tax of 10%; and an increase in the tax on tobacco (to reduce consumption). The reforms also introduced a controlled foreign companies (CFC) regime, a system that limits the artificial deferral of tax through recourse to lower-taxed offshore havens; lengthened the statute of limitations regarding tax returns and assessments; and limited loss carry forwards to 12 years, a method of applying one year's losses to a future year's revenues that often artificially lowers a firm's tax contribution more than otherwise would be the case.<br>Taken together, these measures are expected to net the state an additional COP6.2 trillion in 2017 and are considered vital to preserving the country's BBB investment-grade rating. By simplifying and scaling individual contributions to be more progressive, increasing total indirect taxation, strengthening municipal taxation, and lowering corporate tax levels, the state is banking on killing more than two birds with one very nimble stone. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOING BUSINESS","doing-business-in-colombia","1395","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-07T07:21:00.000Z","2017-09-07T07:21:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Striking A Deal","<p>On May 11, 2017, 350,000 Colombian teachers from the powerful Colombian Federation of Education Workers (FECODE) went on strike to ask for better working conditions. All over the nation, but mainly in Bogotá, daily-held marches frequently blocked roads and paralyzed the education system. Teachers were asking for higher wages as their salaries reached a minimum of COP1.8 million (USD610) per month—an amount they consider inadequate and a poor incentive for young talents to become teachers. Strikers also requested efforts to hire more teachers and provide more classroom space. They claim they can have as many as 50 students in a class and not enough room for full class days. Other demands included food programs, better transportation, and technology access in schools.</p><p>The FECODE union finally agreed on June 16, after 37 days of strike, to form a deal with Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas. The deal will offer progressive bonus payments and stronger participation from unions. Concerning general educational demands, the government will make available early education programs, 7,000 scholarships for master's degrees in teaching, and plans to improve foreign language training programs. On top of that, the government promised to modernize infrastructure and announced that it has already delivered 120,000 tablets to familiarize underprivileged children with technology.</p><p>This year's protests began in response to the government's lack of action following a previous strike in 2015, fighting the absence of accountability to meet their earlier demands. In 2015, teachers organized to fight for better wages, healthcare, and evaluation measures. FECODE accepted the government's offer of a 12% wage increase over four years and less stringent evaluation measures. However, with little improvement in pay, initial negotiations turned into general strike when the Ministry of Education declared it did not have enough funds to deliver on the previous agreement.</p><p>While the government claims there is not enough funding, it simultaneously names education as a top development focus. President Manuel Santos' National Development Plan for 2014-2018 states that education, alongside peace and equity, is one of the country's priorities. In 2015, he announced an ambitious project for Colombia to be the most educated country in Latin America by 2025. Furthermore, the revised peace deal signed on the November 24, 2016 with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) also includes education investment promises in rural areas, though teachers would argue limited fulfilment of these promises. In February 2016, former US President Obama pledged to give more than USD450 million to help Colombia build a unified and prosperous nation. However, the election of President Trump and his planned reduction of international development funding is endangering this promise. </p><p>The OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) study provides a ranking of countries based on students' performance in mathematics, science, and reading. Historically, Colombia was among the worst performers. And though still considered below the Latin America average, Colombia gained 19 positions in 2015's ranking. In order to keep improving education by international standards, the government is considering regulating and internationalizing its universities. In Colombia, 50% of young people now attend university, a rate that has increased dramatically over the past 30 years and provided the catalyst for the creation of many new entities. Along with 82 universities, the current system also comprises “university institutions,“ and “technological institutions“ with a large diversity in terms of educational quality, access, and infrastructures.<br>Though the strike ended with a favorable agreement for teachers, with the Ministry of Education's poor track record of delivering on commitments and uncertain foreign development funding, Colombia's teachers are not celebrating a victory quite yet. Implementation of reforms and allocation of promised funding—and most importantly, the educational outcomes for students—remain to be seen. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EDUCATION INVESTMENT","striking-a-deal","1324","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-07T06:29:00.000Z","2017-09-07T06:29:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Roads Well  Traveled","<p>Signaling a new era of growth for Colombia's tourism industry, the country received more than 2.6 million foreign visitors in 2016. According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism, the number of tourists increased by 13% and was projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% from 2016-2020 to reach 3.2 million by 2020. In 2017, the country is preparing to welcome increased tourism inflows as new areas of the country open up for development and infrastructure. At the same time, the Lonely Planet's ranking of Colombia as the world's second-best country to visit in 2017 heralds good things for the economy, especially for destinations such as Bogotá, Barranquilla, Medellí­n, and Cartagena.</p><p>At the forefront of boosting tourism in the country is President Juan Manuel Santos. The Santos administration recently announced that 2017 and much of 2018 would be dedicated to promoting tourism in post-conflict areas of Colombia, with the aim of increasing visitor numbers by 30%. One of the ways in which the government plans to increase inflows is through a commitment to building up niche segments, especially medical tourism and ecotourism. While the vast majority of visitors came to Colombia for vacation, 37.6% more visitors came for medical tourism in 2016 than in 2015. In regard to ecotourism, quality over quantity is what counts. In a speech made in January 2017, President Santos explained, “While a regular tourist spends an average of USD80 per day in Colombia, eco-tourists spend over USD400."" In order to capitalize on this potential, however, the tourism sector should form close partnerships with entities in transportation and mining, as well as with environmental organizations. </p><p>To this end, the Colombian government has already started a slew of new initiatives, including a campaign launched in March 2017 to rediscover and engage with destinations across the country that were affected by conflict, such as Boyaa, Santander, Cauca, and the Western Plains. Through these various programs, the Santos administration is promoting national integration by focusing its attention specifically on areas that were previously inaccessible, have experienced a lack of infrastructure, or have historically not participated in the government. Attracting tourists to these areas in particular, experts agree, will be a huge step toward unifying the country and building mutual understanding.</p><p>Parallel to the increase of foreign visitors, foreign retailers are moving into Colombia as it grows. According to a research from international consulting firm AT Kearney, Colombia weighed in as the second-most attractive country to invest in retail in Latin America. Known as the Global Retail Development Index, the research also highlights Colombia's rapid rise through the ranks; in 2007, Colombia ranked 30th in the world in terms of retail investment potential, but climbed 15 spots in under a decade to reach 15th in 2016.</p><h4>WARM WELCOME</h4><p>Colombia remains most popular with visitors from the US, which brought nearly 500,000 visitors to the country in 2016. Meanwhile, 400,000 Europeans, 350,000 Venezuelans, and 180,000 Brazilians visited Colombia during the same period. Traditionally attracting male tourists, Colombia saw a rise in female visitors of nearly 17% in 2016, illustrating the rapid diversification of the sector. Figures demonstrate that the tourism sector is also expanding horizontally to distribute the share of visitors more evenly across the country, as well as a balance between domestic and international tourists in each zone.</p><p>Up until 2015, Bogotá received more than 50% of all international visitors in Colombia, but by 2016, that number had dropped to 46%. Bolí­var province, home of Cartagena, saw its share increase by the largest amount to reach 14.2%. Meanwhile, Medellí­n's province of Antioquia received 13.2% of foreign visitors. <br>Although the number of outbound trips fell in 2015, domestic tourism was projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.7% over the 2016-2020 period to reach 32.6 million by 2020. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism predicts that outbound tourism trips will number approximately 5 million by 2020.</p><h4>ENJOY YOUR STAY</h4><p>Over the 2012-2016 period, investment in the hotel sector grew by 740%. Reflecting the growing demand for bilingualism in the industry, during 2016 alone, 10,000 English-speaking hospitality professionals were hired at hotels. Overall, there are 1.8 million Colombians employed in the sector, making it the second-most important source of foreign exchange for the economy after oil and gas.</p><p>One of the major contributors to the hotel sector's rapid rise in investment is Hilton. Along with local contractor Constructora Colpatria, Hilton announced the signing of a franchise license agreement in March 2017 to open the upcoming Hilton Medellí­n. The multimillion-dollar project is expected to become one of the largest real estate investments in Colombia in 2017. Comprising 25 floors and 206 rooms, the hotel is set to open its doors in 2Q2019. In 2016, the hotelier opened the DoubleTree Bogotá Calle 100, Hampton by Hilton Bucaramanga, and Hampton Inn by Hilton Medellí­n. Hilton currently boasts a portfolio of 14 properties in the country in addition to nine projects in the pipeline. The newest addition to the lineup will be located on the Avenida de las Palmas, offering accessibility to one Medellí­n's busiest strips. Hilton Medellí­n will be part of a mixed-use development, to include retail, office space and non-branded residential units in a complex with a parking garage with more than 450 parking spaces.</p><p>Ever a tourist hotspot owing to its historical charm, Cartagena is another popular investment destination for hotel operators. “We realized that Cartagena can offer our guests multiple services in one visit. Our guests can enjoy the city, and our private beach provides a more exclusive experience for visiting Cartagena's world famous coast,"" Miguel Dí­ez Trujillo, President of Hoteles Estelar, explained to TBY. The Estelar Cartagena de Indias hotel offers 338 rooms, two restaurants, a swimming pool, and a convention center with the capacity to host 1,200 people. Standing at 202m high, the hotel has 51 floors and 47,000sqm of room.</p><h4>IN GOOD COMPANY</h4><p>To attract investment and ensure best practices are employed, Colombia plays an active role in the international community when it comes to tourism sector policy. As an important member of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), Colombia nominated a representative to run for the office of Secretary-General for the upcoming 2018-2021 term. Unfortunately the candidate, Jaime Alberto Cabal Sanclemente, was unsuccessful.</p><p>The UNWTO acts as an advisory body for specific tourism laws, exerting influence on destination marketers and tourism organizations around the world. If elected, a Colombian Secretary-General would have guided the future of global tourism in dozens of countries. Sanclemente is the Ambassador of Colombia to Austria. In various leadership positions in Colombian tourism organizations over the past 20 years, he has focused on sustainability.</p><p>Domestically, Colombia plays host to the annual Colombian Association of Travel Agencies (Anato) travel and tourism conference. The 2017 edition marked the 36th anniversary of Anato, and attracted over 34,000 to the exhibition center in Corferias. Compared to the previous year, 20% more tourism professionals participated from over 40 countries and 32 departments of Colombia. According to local press, approximately USD150 million in business deals were established at the conference in early March 2017.</p><h4>RETAIL </h4><p>As activity in the tourism sector heats up, new opportunities have arisen for retailers seeking to get ahead of the curve. Colombia's prime environment for business, stability, and overall macroeconomic performance have afforded it high marks in terms of low risk. Moreover, Colombia's population size, urban ratio, number of cities, retail sales per capita, infrastructure, and regulatory framework have boosted market attractiveness. Two other criteria identified by the Global Retail Development Index are sector saturation and historical growth. <br>Despite the fact that Colombia's retail market has been affected by the decline of the local currency and inflation rate, local brands are starting to see competition stiffen. Chilean retail chain Falabella recently announced plans to invest USD4 billion into its outlets across Latin America during the 2017-2020 period, including the addition of 114 stores and nine shopping malls. The chain currently has 25 department stores across Colombia, many of which will be refurbished along with Falabella's investment plans.</p><p>The North Face has eight stores in Colombia, including in Bogotá, Medellí­n, Manizales, and Chí­a. As of 2016, the company was in negotiations toward finishing a major retail deal with Colombian department stores. Off to a good start, the company posted growth in sales of 40% in 2015.</p><p>With over 60 stores in Colombia and the region, Mario Hernández reduces the cost of doing business by controlling the entire supply chain and producing 100% locally. “As the country becomes more open and more international products come in, the company needs to compete with the other brands that enter the country."" Mario Hernández Zambrano, President &amp; Founder of Mario Hernández, told TBY, adding “That is why we are trying to bring a new level of quality, as well as the manufacturing and knowhow that we have, for leather and the artisans that are working with us."" </p><p>New for 2017 in the retail sector is the pop-up store trend. Already a well-established practice in Europe and North America, pop-up stores boost sales and assess markets based on customer habits. The pop-up format is proving to be very effective for local labels and is conducive to SMEs that seek to enter the retail sector with minimal upfront capital without compromising on profitability and high sales figures in a short period of time. However, the main advantage for the pop-up format is for companies to guarantee market presence prior to opening a permanent store. With the right infrastructure in place and consumer demand increasing consistently, the retail sector is set to diversify and expand rapidly. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/8cbf8c58-4c57-4e32-b2b8-e8f09bd6f2e3.jpg","","","","Ushering in nationwide integration, Colombia's tourism and retail sectors are expected to not only boost the economy, but also play key roles in promoting and sustaining peace.","","","roads-well-traveled","1373","552ef2b0361618126878404e","553a23d886b7b00ae0c20907","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reform instituted a mandatory social insurance system in which the General System of Social Security in Health (Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud, SGSSS) provides coverage that is intermediated by a market of private insurance providers competing for patients.</p><p>The reform established the Mandatory Health Plan (Plan Obligatorio de Salud, POS), a comprehensive list of services, treatments, and drugs to which health service providers (entidades promotoras de salud, EPS) would have access. EPS are private insurance companies that act as an intermediary between health service institutions (instituciones prestadoras de salud, IPS) and their patients.</p><p>HSR involves two classifications of coverage: contributive and subsidized. The contributive scheme is funded by payroll taxes from formal employees and employers while the subsidized scheme in financed by public funds. Employees contribute 12.5% of their salaries to the contributive system and 1.5% to the subsidized system. For subsidized coverage, the government funnels funds into local municipalities, which then transfer the money to insurance companies that service the subsidized population. By 2015, some 45% of the Colombian population was receiving healthcare coverage under the contributive framework while 48% of the population—households that are unemployed or informally employed—were receiving subsidized healthcare coverage.</p><p>A clear emphasis has been placed on protecting the most vulnerable groups, evidenced by the marked rise of subsidies for this population from USD42 million in 1994 to USD550 million in 1995. The greatest expansion in healthcare coverage was witnessed among the poorest 20% of the population—coverage rose from 4% to 89% between 1993 and 2014. In rural areas, penetration rose from 7% to 93% during the same period. Meanwhile, Colombia's out-of-pocket spending as part of total national expenditure on health has dropped from 52% in 1993 to some 14%—one of the lowest rates in Latin America and lower than the OECD average of some 19%.</p><p>Despite HSR's promising direction and overall healthcare coverage successes, it ultimately failed to have its intended effect—there emerged a major gap between formal and material coverage that revealed inherent governmental and regulatory agency weaknesses. Public hospitals and private insurance companies failed to fit the bill and left many patients, particularly of the poor population, unable to access treatment. Between 1999 and 2014, patients filed more than 1.3 million lawsuits insisting on access to healthcare services, treatment, and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>In February 2015, the government passed the Statutory Health Law (LES), or Law 1751 of 2015, which seeks to strengthen former reforms and narrow the gap between formal and material coverage. LES served as a legal guarantee to the fundamental right to healthcare by all Colombian citizens, establishing a connection between the right to health and essential public health interventions, addressing social determinants of health and stating that fiscal or financial sustainability should not become an obstruction to access to healthcare.</p><h4>Profit Over Patient</h4><p>Even with the LES reform, Colombians with the most basic form of coverage—poor and rural populations—suffer from healthcare services and prescription rationing and only receive care from inferior facilities. However, this comes as no surprise when the Colombian healthcare system's users and health providers continue to be intermediated by an EPS system that is virtually designed to be abused. In theory, EPS keep overall costs down by giving Colombians greater control over the health market. In practice, EPS under-perform their function for the sake of profit. EPS receive government funds upfront and independently of any services they approve for patients. To spend as little money as possible, EPS block patients from receiving health treatments through bureaucratic measures as well as by withholding payments for health services. In this way, the healthcare system remains one of profit instead of one that benefits all Colombians. While many call for the elimination of the EPS role altogether, others note that EPS are the only force keeping down prices. The LES reform introduced a regulatory body to control EPS and outlined that doctors would have the freedom to prescribe medicines needed by patients without taking into consideration EPS budget constraints. Even so, the reform did little to remedy the reality of EPS and their vulnerability to collusion.</p><h4>Down in Debt</h4><p>The pairing of private insurers and institutions with nearly universal access to healthcare has stirred competition in the sector, but to a fault. EPS owe some COP5.8 trillion to the IPS. The corruption rampant in the EPS segment has put both the contributory and subsidized regimes in debt while many hospitals face imminent bankruptcy. In 2014, the contributory and subsidized regimes experienced a deficit of USD83 million and USD91 million, respectively. Also in 2014, the government announced that it had fueled 300 of Colombia's hospitals with USD373 million over the past year in order to avoid bankruptcies. Among other things, from 2006 to 2012, EPS were using public funds to charge double the price for medicines already covered by the Compulsory Health Plan, costing the health system millions of dollars. Strapped for cash, hospitals are forced to resort to unethical practices. Competition among public hospitals has made them eager for economic profit, sometimes in exchange for patients' health needs. It is common practice for patients with profitable illness to be offered services while patients who are uninsured or lacking proper documentation are denied services. Accessibility is mostly attributable to supply-side constraints.</p><h4>A Future of Growth</h4><p>Despite its woes, Colombia's health sector is eager to put itself on the map for investment and growth. To build its international medical tourism performance, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism founded the Productive Transformation Program (PTP) with the purpose of facilitating foreign currency earnings. The PTP anticipates a nine-fold increase in the number of medical tourists—from 31,884 in 2015 to 2.8 million in 2032. This growth hinges on the investments that improve the services of medical institutions in Colombia. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical market is poised for growth. According to GlobalData, the pharmaceutical market in the country will increase at a compound growth rate of 7.3%, from USD5 billion in 2015 to USD7.1 billion in 2020. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Health","build-from-here","1385","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the decades-long conflict disproportionately affecting certain rural departments, it is no secret that the success of the peace deal and the reintegration of large parts of Colombian society rests on rural and agricultural development. One agribusiness in particular, palm oil and its related biofuel, stands to be a key driver of socioeconomic development in the regions most affected by conflict. In fact, even before the signing of the peace accord, the palm oil industry in Colombia was in the midst of a boom in investment and production and already accounts for roughly 6% of the country's GDP. </p><p>The recognition of palm oil's role and opportunities in the post-conflict era has not been lost on the government, foreign institutions, or the private sector. The US Agency for International Development (USAID), for example, has been an involved player in the growth and promotion of the palm oil industry as a viable alternative. USAID helped to establish pilot programs for disarming and reintegrating ex-paramilitary members on palm oil plantations, as well as generally assisting the Colombian government's goal of expanding the total land use of palm oil production. In 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a COP1.6 billion investment plan to add an additional 150,000ha to the roughly 500,000ha industry over the next three years. <br>As it stands, Colombia is already the fourth largest producer of palm oil in the world, behind Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Its 1.2 million tons of palm oil produced in 2015 makes it the largest in Latin America. Roughly a third of the palm oil produced in Colombia is then used to create palm-based biofuel as part of the country's battle against CO2 emissions and pollution. As of now, all petroleum in the country is a blend of 8% sugarcane or palm biofuel. According to Dr. Jorge Bendeck, the Executive President of the National Biofuels Federation of Colombia, the biofuels industry (sugarcane and palm) has reduced annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2.3 million tons per year. As of 2016, Dr. Bendeck estimates that biofuels are responsible for directly employing 32,000 people, as well as 64,000 additional jobs indirectly. </p><p>Commenting on the social and political advantages of the industry, Dr. Bendeck added, “One of the three main goals when we founded the biofuel federation was to help the country achieve peace. By creating stable jobs, we are removing the incentive for conflict and war. When people are employed, they are less likely to resort to conflict. We are producing peace by cultivating raw materials necessary for the creation of biofuel. In locations where we have established plantations, we have secured peace.""</p><p>While Colombia lags far behind the palm oil production of its Asian competitors—33.4 million tons in Indonesia and 19.9 million tons in Malaysia in 2015, according to GreenPalm—it does have a distinct environmental advantage: much of Colombia's palm expansion can be grown on previously arable land, whereas Malaysia and Indonesia have come under intense international pressure because their palm oil industries come at the expense of biodiverse rain forests. According to a government report from the Unit of Rural Agro-economic Planning (UPRA) in 2016, at least 65% of Colombia's arable land is currently unused or underused, making Colombia one of the world leaders in terms of agricultural potential. As international consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental costs of palm oil, Colombia's markedly less destructive industry—which allows plantations to more easily receive internationally recognized sustainability certifications—should prove even more competitive on the global stage in the coming years. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The government and private sector investors are betting heavily not just on palm oil's economic potential, but also as a strategic product in the rural development and reintegration of areas looking to rebuild in the post-conflict era.","","Palm Oil","in-the-palm-of-your-land","1442","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-06T11:12:00.000Z","2017-09-06T11:12:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Fruits of Labor","<p>Providing the third-largest source of Colombian exports, the agriculture sector continues to be a staple of the local economy. While 2015-2016 saw many sectors affected by falling oil prices, agriculture took only a minor blow, demonstrating the solidity of the sector and its resilience to external market forces. As of late 2016, the agriculture sector represented over 17% of Colombia's total exports, just behind manufacturing at 25% and hydrocarbons at 51%.</p><p>However, it is widely accepted that Colombia has yet to truly tap into its potential as an agriculture producer and exporter. Of its nearly 44 million ha of arable land, only 7 million ha is currently being cultivated. Decades of conflict in rural areas, combined with a lack of unifying infrastructure for developing the sector, are two factors that have hindered fast-paced growth. </p><p>According to Rafael Mejia López, former President of the Agricultural Association of Colombia and the Sociedad de Agricultores de Colombia (SAC), Colombia produced 25.6 million tons of agricultural products in 2000, while in 2015 the country produced 32 million tons. At the same time, exports rose from 4 million tons in 2000 to 4.2 million tons in 2015, demonstrating overall marginal growth year to year. Demand, however, grew at a much more rapid pace, as imports increased from 5.5 million tons in 2000 to 11.4 million tons in 2015. In 1H2016, Colombia imported 6.7 million tons of food, an 11.4% increase from 1H2015. Regardless, the agriculture sector posted 2% growth in 4Q2016, rising to account for 6% of the nation's total GDP. Meanwhile, exports during 1H2016 increased by 2.2% YoY, signaling an acceleration of growth figures across the board.<br>In 2017, the political situation is expected to stabilize further as a ceasefire is enforced and the government makes even stronger commitments to the growth of the agriculture industry. High on the agenda is ensuring that the growth is not only sustainable, but also beneficial to small- and medium-sized farms, which comprise the vast majority of the farming industry. To that end, government officials are identifying ways to help farmers expand their operations without negatively impacting the local way of life or the surrounding environment.</p><h4>CROPPING UP</h4><p>Rice, beans, cassava, maize, sugar, coffee, bananas, palm oil, and avocados are just a few of Colombia's most-produced crops. The palm oil sector in Colombia captures one of the largest shares of the economic and geographic pie. Approximately 500,000ha of land in Colombia is dedicated to the cultivation of palm oil, a product that has been manufactured in the country for over five decades, and exported to Europe for the last 25 years. As the dust settles in previously conflict-stricken areas, more and more land is available for the production of palm oil. However, for sustainable development to flourish, serious government support is necessary. According to Jens Mesa-Dishington, Executive President of the National Federation of Oil Palm Growers (Fedepalma), “Some of the rules and regulations need stability, especially if we are to have a sector that is for the long term. We need more flexible regulations that fit the needs of the agriculture sector. Many of the regulations are thought out for the urban sector, not the rural needs. The needs of the rural sector are different."" Mesa-Dishington also called on the private sector to take notice of the potential of the palm oil sector, in particular when it comes to innovation and bringing business to previously underserved areas. “We are a tropical country, and if we are talking about opportunities in the rural sector, palm oil comes on the list as an important sector with many opportunities. A sector like palm oil can grow in Colombia, but we need investors,"" he concluded. As of early 2016, the Colombian government reported that the local agricultural sector attracts just 1% of all FDI injected into the country, highlighting the potential impact that larger investment activity could make.</p><p>Carlo Vigna, Director General of Poligrow, echoes the sentiments of Fedepalma's leadership, yet argues that the first priority for the palm oil segment is to attract investment from public institutions, due not in small part to the necessity of building an environmentally friendly industry. “We currently have a certification from Rainforest Alliance, and we are working on receiving a certification from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),"" Vigna told TBY. In 2017, the company seeks to establish a production plant in Mapiripan in order to increase production volumes, as well as a refinery project designed to allow Poligrow to diversify its offer of palm-based products. Poligrow's efforts to capitalize on newly available land, as well as encourage local communities to be involved in the expansion of its business, has earned the company a solid reputation in the agriculture sectors at large. For people living in areas where Poligrow does business, “We have noticed a shift in their quality of life: when we first arrived, people would approach us asking for food, healthcare, and other necessities. Now, they approach us with business ideas, which shows how far they have come in being able to visualize a better future,"" Vigna explained.</p><p>The main banana producing areas in Colombia are Antioquia, including Apartado, Turbo, and Chigorodó, which comprises 37,100ha and can yield a production of 1.2 million tons annually; Guajira, including Riohacha and Dibulla, with 2,096ha and a production of nearly 75,000 tons annually; and Magdalena, including the Zona Bananera and El Retén, which combine to form an area of over 11,000ha and boast a production capacity of nearly 400,000 tons per annum. According to local forecasts, Colombia was expected to harvest bananas from well over 83,000ha of land throughout the country, with an early production estimate of 2.2 million tons overall.</p><p>Sugarcane, which can be harvested year-round in Colombia, is another important product for the sector. It is the main ingredient in producing high-purity ethanol, an important fuel source that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 74%. Looking ahead to the future, Colombia has the potential to take the lead on the production of biofuels such as ethanol, which can also support the energy sector through the co-generation of electricity. While a significant 85% of Colombia's sugar is still harvested by hand, companies such as Manuelita are capable of producing 4.2 million tons of sugarcane per year. With 500 years of history, the local sugarcane industry is at once a legacy of Colombia's agricultural past and a boon for the future of agribusiness.<br>Luis Fernando Londoño Capurro, President of Sugarcane Growers Association of Colombia (Asocaña), told TBY in an interview that his organization is dedicated to moving the industry ahead by strengthening ties with partners abroad, as well as rising up to meet international standards. “I have been working on formalizing labor in the agro-industry, in a form now recognized by the US Department of Labor. That department is monitoring our labor action plan, which is part of our FTA with the US. The five sectors that have been defined as complying are mining, ports, power generation, flowers, and the sugarcane agro-industry,"" he said.</p><h4>WELL GOVERNED</h4><p>In late 2015, the government launched a program to support wider agricultural production, in tandem with the need to supply more food—as well as more opportunities—to rural areas of the country. The Colombia Siembra initiative began allocating up to USD500 million from 2016 and will continue through to 2018. These funds will primarily be used to invest in equipment, irrigation, transportation, and other resources needed to cultivate an additional 1 million ha with rice, corn, soybeans, and vegetables. When complete, Colombia Siembra, or “Colombia Sows,"" will have created 260,000 jobs in rural areas and stimulated growth to reach a pace of 6.2% by 2018.</p><p>In 2015, 83% of farmers lacked the sufficient machinery and infrastructure to produce at competitive prices, and under 10% of farmers had ever received technical assistance to develop their plots. Colombia Siembra was designed not only to address the needs of small- and medium-sized farmers, but also to support exportation, with the goal of reaching 4% annual growth in agricultural exports. <br>The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has also stepped in to support Colombia in the wake of peace accords through programs that will ensure land reform, safeguarding rights to property or access to land, and protecting forests and fisheries. The agency is also expected to offer expertise in terms of monitoring and evaluating local social protection programs. At a press conference, UN ambassador Juan Mesa Zuleta noted that Colombia is among seven countries identified by the UN “that can best contribute"" to ending world hunger, as it is the only country in South America with access to both the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, and has huge potential to increase production, and subsequently exports, exponentially</p><p>After investing nearly USD28 billion toward exporting Colombian products abroad since 2010, the government is currently seeking ways to delve into new markets in 2017. Avocados are expected to be exported to the US by the end of the year, and China is the next target market. The Minister of Agriculture, Aurelio Iragorri Valencia, had already started formal proceedings to begin exporting avocados to China, while opening up Peru as a trading partner for avocados in late 2016. Nevertheless, Colombia will still have about 35 million ha of arable land that could be incorporated into the total cultivated area without any deforestation or serious harm to the environment. Experts have noted similarities between Colombia's eastern plains and the Brazilian Cerrado in the 1990s. With major state-led investment, arable fields in northeastern Brazil became a major producer for soybeans, corn, and cotton. Should Colombia receive comparable government support and more interest from investors, many suggest that a huge agricultural boom is close at hand. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/5d89f348-d1cc-4069-8654-a322566d32f8.jpg","","","","As peace negotiations are finalized, Colombia is moving forward to draw attention to newly available arable land in the post-conflict era—without compromising on sustainability.","","","fruits-of-labor","1438","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent peace deal, large infrastructure projects, improving inflation, an influx of international investment, and strong fundamentals in the domestic economy are expected to propel the industry forward in 2017. Moving forward, the PPP model will be particularly important as firms across Colombia seek to rebuild infrastructure. According to BBVA, construction will be the industry with the third highest growth rate in 2017, thanks largely to 4th Generation Road Concession (4G) projects and growth in low and middle-income housing projects. Additionally, new housing projects are expected to account for nearly 450,000 new homes by the end of 2018. </p><p>Construction has remained one of the leading drivers of growth, and it has served to counterbalance declines in mining and oil and gas. According to the most recently available data from the Colombian government, the construction industry in Colombia is the third largest in Latin America, representing around USD35 billion in economic activity. The sector has grown by an average of 8% in the last five years, and it is projected to top USD52 billion by 2020. Cement consumption in Colombia has also been on the rise and it currently totals 291kg per capita, with projections for it to reach 329kg by the end of the decade. All told, 4G projects are projected to need 74 million tons of aggregate materials. By 2018 building material consumption is expected to rise in all core areas: concrete, cement and plaster consumption is projected to reach USD5.17 billion; metals products, USD2 billion; non-metallic minerals, USD2.314 billion; clay minerals, USD1.793 billion; and PVC pipe, USD308 million, according Colombia's National Administrative Department of Statistics. With wages 24% lower than the rest of Latin America and nearly 200,000 college graduates from fields related to the sector, the construction industry is poised to continue growing strong well into the next decade.</p><h4>4G Projects</h4><p>A 10-year, USD24 billion project, the 4G plans to develop a national toll road system, revolutionizing transportation infrastructure in Colombia and setting a new standard for the region. According to the World Bank, this project will rely on at least 40 PPPs, with major domestic and international firms. In coming years, the plan is set to include the construction of almost 6,000km of new roads, scores of new tunnels and nearly 100 new bridges. Though there have been some delays and a few setbacks in the project, Colombian firms are largely optimistic about the growth the 4G plan can bring to the country in terms of both economic prosperity and social integration. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Luz Marí­a Jaramillo de Méndez, President of Pavimentos Colombia, discussed the holistic role she sees her company playing in the development of the country. “We have a macro commitment to the 4G projects that will connect Colombia to the world,“ said Méndez. “We also have a micro commitment to our communities to bring progress as well. Roads will bring them to locations and opportunities to access the world they did not have before. The social responsibility we follow is not only internal as a company but is focused on the local communities as well as the rest of the country.“ Economic growth and community development go hand in hand with the 4G projects, and expectations are high.</p><p>Growth and prosperity will not, however, be limited to the construction sectors and many players in the real estate space are excited about 4G's implications for their business. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Roberto Cáceres, Managing Director of Colombia for Colliers International, explained the potential he sees in the 4G plan and how his company hopes to take advantage of these opportunities. “The 4G plan will have a special impact on roads that will completely change the logistics market. This will generate huge development opportunities in the next few years, causing the logistics of the country to change massively. This is what we are targeting,“ said Cáceres. “Altogether, there will be huge opportunities for developers and investors who understand these new logistics.“</p><h4>Global Reach</h4><p>Colombian construction firms are also looking beyond Colombia, targeting new markets for growth and development. Latin America, the Caribbean and North America are all markets being considered by Colombian firms, and expectations are high that Colombian firms will cement their status as world-class builders and developers. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Juan Esteban Calle, CEO of Cementos Argos, discussed his firm's ambitions for expansion, noting the growing importance of Colombia's neighbors to the North and South. “We want to become a leading cement producer in the Americas,“ said Calle. “Our area of interest stretches from Canada to the tip of Argentina.“ According to Calle, the US alone is projected to represent 55% of the company's revenues and 45% of its EBITA in 2017. Like many Colombian firms, Cementos Argos is interested in operating in a mix of high growth areas and more stable markets. “We want a balanced footprint of assets and business,“ said Calle. “The US is particularly attractive because it is a developed market with a stable currency. This means that most of our exposure is in Central America and the Caribbean, where the demographics are attractive and the potential for growth is high.“ Like Cementos Argos, more and more Colombian firms are maturing and looking beyond the Colombian market for their next move.</p><h4>Real Estate Market</h4><p>According to international consultancy E&amp;S Property Investment, commercial property has been steady in recent months, while there has been some slowdown in office space and an uptick in retail. Bogotá in particular has seen impressive growth in recent months, and office space is expected to grow by 43% by the end of 2017, and rental prices are between USD25-40 per sqm per month. Medellí­n, the country's second largest market, has also seen impressive growth, and it is expected to finish the year with 36% with rents between USD15-25 per sqm per month. Cali is expected to hit 29% growth by the end of the year. The Colombian Association of Shopping Centers projects that Colombia will add more than 30 shopping centers across 18 cities by the end of the year.</p><h4>Affordable Housing</h4><p>Colombia has long suffered a housing shortage in many areas, but new government programs are aimed at correcting this. The government hopes to reduce the shortage by as much as 50% in coming years. More than 100,000 homes for the poor have already been constructed. Slum housing has been a persistent problem, and the government is committed to bringing an improved standard of living to as many Colombians as possible. <br>Additionally, Colombia's Housing Ministry is attempting to increase housing loans to citizens across the country. According to Bloomberg, Colombia's Housing Minister has made overtures to the country's banking associations to increase maximum loan-to-value rates for mortgages to 80%. Mortgages currently sit at around 7% of GDP, and over the last decade, home prices have increased over 80%. Public and private officials are hoping that relaxed credit requirements will further stimulate the market, bringing new homebuyers into the fold. While there have been some concerns that the Colombian housing market may be entering a bubble, prices are still below the highs seen immediately preceding the crisis in the late 1990s.</p><h4>Building for the Future <br></h4><p>Sustainability has become the new buzzword in the Colombian real estate market. In a recent interview with TBY, David Luján Pérez, General Manager of LJN, described developers dedication to rebuilding Colombia in a more socially and environmentally conscious way. “Now we are a part of a new generation that thinks that the economic growth of a company and the environment should both be considered in equal measure,“ said Pérez. “You do not have to damage the environment to have economic growth; this is a new generation trying to develop and generate projects and ideas that take care of those issues for the long term in a sustainable manner.“ Green building is coming more and more to the fore as developers recognize the value and importance of creating homes and infrastructure that can coexist with the natural environment. “The market now appreciates that when some projects are more sustainable than others, people notice. And this is what causes demand to grow.“ </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/58af4e16-823b-465e-878c-aa1af50941d6.jpg","","","","","","","building-connections","1383","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although these numbers made it the second highest after Brazil, it was much less than the 450,000-600,000 expected cases. While 18% of these cases included pregnant women, 0.5% resulted in neurological syndromes, mostly being Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), and 0.3% in cranial malformation in babies.</p><p>Although Zika's progression in Colombia was fast, it caused no deaths. Other countries, such as Brazil, were not as lucky and were caught off guard by the outbreak. The main driver of Colombia's relative success in combating Zika was a comprehensive monitoring effort put in place by the time the first infections were confirmed in October 2015. Parallel to this effort, Colombian health officials published detailed weekly bulletins that reported the number of infections and their location, as well as statistics on Zika-related complications, including microcephaly and GBS.</p><p>Colombia's success was also guided by international support and collaboration, especially from US health officials. The US-Colombian partnership on health outlined in Plan Colombia's successor, the recently announced Peace Colombia, was especially successful. Through Peace Colombia, the US collaborates with Colombia to research infectious diseases and figure out the best way to address them. The effectiveness of this partnership has already been demonstrated by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) work with Colombia's INS in setting up the Zika surveillance system. This allowed them to track the spread of the disease and its impact on pregnant women and children so health officials could know exactly what they were up against.<br>The CDC also worked closely with Colombian doctors to identify Zika's risks through “enhanced surveillance"" programs in three cities—Cucuta, Barranquilla, and Cali—where researchers monitored fetal development in infected mothers and continue to track babies' growth for at least a year after birth. Cali and the surrounding department of Valle del Cauca reported nearly 25,000 Zika infections, more than any other territory in Colombia. But as of July 2016 there had not been a single case of microcephaly linked to the virus. The Ministry of Health also decided during this time to stop recommending that women living in high-risk areas postpone their pregnancies, and allowed them to travel throughout the country without any restrictions. <br>However, when World Health Organization (WHO) official Bruce Aylward was asked why the microcephaly numbers in Colombia are so much lower than in Brazil, he told reporters that the country is only counting “live births,"" indicating that many Colombian women with Zika are miscarrying or seeking to interrupt their pregnancies. Martha Lucí­a Ospina, Director of the INS, backed this by stating that miscarriages due to Zika increased 8% in Colombia.</p><p>According to the WHO, a dozen laboratories and public agencies around the world are working on a vaccine, but it could take years to commercialize due to the virus' massive global presence and capability to be transmitted sexually, often asymptomatically. On the other hand, Zika can only be acquired once, and group immunity is normally developed among populations, which makes it easier to control.</p><p>Nevertheless, Ospina led a group of Colombian researchers in writing the most rigorous and detailed analysis on the evolution and expansion of the Zika virus, which was later published on the New England Journal of Medicine's online portal. This study will help governments around the world understand how the Zika virus behaves and evolves, as well as assist health authorities in promoting campaigns oriented at reducing the risk of all transmitted diseases such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikunguña. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The Zika virus posed a special threat to the 26 million Colombians living in 900 municipalities below 2,200m. Nevertheless, due to proper surveillance, international cooperation, and an immediate government response, Colombia was the first country in the Americas to announce the end of the Zika epidemic.","","Zika VIrus","ending-the-epidemic","1306","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Colombia has long used concessions to fund infrastructural investment and development, but a collective understanding that additional regulatory structures were needed led the Colombian parliament to pass new legislation on PPPs in 2012. Championed as a necessary first step to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure by President Juan Manuel Santos, the legislature eliminated the National Institute of Concessions and created a new National Infrastructure Agency. Colombia's PPPs require an initial investment of approximately USD1.8 million to be funded either privately or by a mix of public and private funds. The PPP law caps concessions at a maximum length of 30 years, mandates transparency throughout each project's lifespan in order to prevent corruption, and limits the amount of funding projects can receive. In designing the law, Colombian legislators looked to similar legislation elsewhere in Latin America and Europe to create a structure that encourages bidding and foreign investment while reducing waste, corruption, and inefficiency. In 2011, Colombia's Ministry of Transportation introduced a transportation infrastructure plan that calls for USD50 billion in investment over the next decade in order to generate a 500% increase in highways, a 300% increase in railroads, and a 50% increase in air travel passengers.</p><p>The ambitious nationwide project has been one of the first major tests for the new PPP model, and early returns have been largely encouraging. One of the most important road projects in the transportation infrastructure plan is “Highways for Prosperity,"" a five-part initiative that will construct 750km of new highways and cut travel times between major cities in half. Originally projected to cost COP5 trillion, it was revised to COP12 trillion due to a reassessment of the bridges and tunnels needed. The Colombian government agreed to finance up to COP10 trillion of the cost of the project. While the railroad infrastructure development program stands as one of the successes of the new PPP system, the difficulties the highway improvement project has faced demonstrate the issues that have some foreign construction firms wary of investing. So far, Colombia's PPPs have worked best with regional companies with previous ties to the area and an understanding of how to navigate the nation's regulatory environment, which, while much improved over the previous system, can still be cumbersome for outsiders. Rural projects frequently have to deal with environmental licensing and negotiations with indigenous groups, adding an element of risk and complexity to already-challenging projects. Still, international interest remains high, especially on the financial side, where banks like Grupo BTG Pactual and Goldman Sachs have been involved in financing efforts. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Currently in the midst of a new wave of nationwide infrastructure development, Colombia revamped its PPP laws in an attempt to increase investment.","","PPPs","partners-in-progress","1335","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-06T08:17:00.000Z","2017-09-06T08:17:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Jet Life","<p>Colombia is in the midst of a major airport infrastructure project aimed at meeting rising tourism demand and improving domestic interconnectedness. With increased volume at both key hubs and smaller regional airports, industry and governmental officials understand that upgrades are needed to ensure safe and reliable air travel. With over USD2.9 billion of improvements planned over the next few years, the sector looks poised to take flight and become the national driver that the nation deserves.</p><p>Colombia has more than 590 airports, 74 of which are commercial. Air travel has grown considerably in recent years, with increased tourism and global business giving the nation one of the highest passenger growth rates in the world—14% a year, well above the 4-6% increases that were the previous norm. According to government statistics, passenger numbers have tripled in the past decade, going from 13 million in 2006 to 34.1 million in 2015. Transportation officials expect increases of as much as 16% in 2017 and project growth to continue in future years, with Bogotá's El Dorado International Airport alone projected to go from 27 million annual passengers to 40 million by 2021. This growth has been spurred by improved safety conditions in the country and a corresponding rise in tourism and commerce as Colombia takes on a larger role in Latin America. However, growth has not come without its own set of difficulties. With dramatic usage increases have come increased stress on an already struggling air transit system. Both international hubs and regional airports are being affected, with midsized cities such as Medellí­n, Cali, and Cartagena ill-equipped to handle the new surge of passengers.</p><p>To meet demand, a number of infrastructure plans have been announced. President Juan Manuel Santos recently introduced a USD70 billion comprehensive infrastructure plan that calls for 31 airport expansions among its many projects. An additional COP2.8 billion will be invested from 2015-2018 toward the remodeling of 57 airports, with the goal of increasing passenger capacity to 46 million by the end of 2018. This increase will be spread throughout the entire country. At El Dorado, for example, the international terminal opened in 2012 is already well over capacity; built to handle 15 million passengers a year, it saw almost twice that number pass through it in 2016. Planes often need to park in remote locations, an inefficient practice that creates problems with connecting flights and baggage handling. Fully aware of the need for further expansion, Colombia has greenlit plans to construct a second airport 15km away. Scheduled to begin in 2017 and be completed in 2021, the USD3 billion project will more than double Bogotá's passenger capacity to 69.2million passengers per year.<br>Additional plans are underway in other cities that have seen a surge in business travel and tourism in recent years as well. Cali's Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport is working on a new international terminal, Cartagena's Rafael Nuñez Airport is expanding from 150 to 200ha and increasing its capacity to 7.5 million passengers, and Barranquilla's Ernesto Cortissoz airport is adding a maintenance hangar and reconstructing a cargo terminal that will raise annual capacity from 2.4 million passengers to 7.4 million by 2036. At Jose Marí­a Cordova airport in Medellí­n, upgrade plans call for new terminals and taxiways, as well as a runway extension that will allow for new international flights. </p><p>Well aware that further development is needed at every level, a number of airports in previously underserved and underdeveloped regions are getting infrastructure upgrades as well. The cities of Yopal, Ibagué, and Pasto will all be receiving new airport terminals thanks to the government's infrastructure push, allowing them to take a more active role in the country's economic growth.  Pasto's airport will receive USD26 million in investment that will double the size of its boarding rooms, increase vehicle capacity, and raise the control tower. The upgrades at the other small airports will follow this model of increasing safety options and size to allow for new flight routes. All involved recognize that reshaping Colombia's air transportation system will not be an overnight task. Indeed, the government's larger infrastructure plan includes projects for up to two decades in the future. Still, improvements are already being felt, and continued work on expanding capability will pay dividends for Colombia as it moves to become a regional and global destination for economic and tourist activity. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","A massive airport infrastructure project is underway as Colombia seeks to upgrade facilities to meet increased business and tourism demand.","","Airport Expansions","jet-life","1397","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405b","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-06T07:26:00.000Z","2017-09-06T07:26:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Transporting the Nation","<p>In recent years, Colombia has signaled a willingness to invest heavily in new and ambitious projects in almost every area of transportation. These far-reaching efforts to improve its infrastructure have already been bearing fruit, and transportation networks and logistics services have been improving. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2016/2017, Colombia is ranked 120th for quality of roads; 104th for quality of railroad infrastructure; 83rd for quality of port infrastructure; and 76th for quality of air transport infrastructure. This compares favorably to last year's results, in which Colombia was ranked 126th, 106th, 85th, and 74th, respectively.</p><h4>Roadways</h4><p>Colombia's roadways are currently undergoing a six-year, USD16 billion reconstruction and renovation project that includes the development of 40 highway concessions. 19 of the concessions have been adjudicated, but financing issues have slowed progress on the final stages. These 4th Generation (4G) road concession projects call for the development of more than 6,000km of new roads, over 130km of tunnels, and nearly 170km of new bridges. The vast majority of the projects aim to improve connectivity across the country, smoothing transportation between major economic centers. Major linkages between port infrastructure and key cities are expected to lower shipping prices and improve the flow of goods and people across the country.</p><h4>Rail</h4><p>With 2,400km of narrow gauge railways, Colombia's railway infrastructure is somewhat limited compared to several of its neighbors, but steps are being taken to improve it. The narrow gauge infrastructure includes four distinct systems that are operated and managed by a mix of private firms and governmental entities. Public rail systems have not been a key priority for the government or private enterprise, and as such they are not as reliable as other networks in the region. The country also has two standard gauge railroads, both of which are privately held and used to transport coal from extraction points to shipping ports.</p><p>While Colombia's rail system has historically been fraught with issues, there are indications that major and long-lasting redevelopment is on the horizon. There are a number of plans currently underway, including seven projects under construction and three in the pipeline. That being said, private industry has articulated an interest in having the government take a more active role in moving rail infrastructure forward. In an interview with TBY, Miguel Centanaro, President of Ferrolat, discussed the size and potential of Colombia's rail infrastructure, noting that the country is in great need of an efficient rail system to help move the more than 300 million tons of freight transported by the country every year. According to Centanaro, the Colombian government needs to take a greater role in spearheading the development. “The government is simply waiting for international companies to come and develop the railroads, but it needs to be far more involved and enthusiastic about the project and the process,“ said Centanaro. “As it stands, two things are most important: a masterplan and a political framework for how we will develop the network.“</p><h4>Air</h4><p>Air travel is one of the country's fastest-growing modes of transport, and industry leaders expect the sector to soar in the coming years. According to the US Commercial Service, passenger air travel grew by 10.2% between 2015-2016 and carried more than 34.2 million passengers. Due to substandard road conditions, many Colombians prefer to travel by plane than car or bus. According to Aerocivil, the country's civilian aviation authority, demand rose by nearly 2.3% in the first two months of 2017 over the same period in 2016. Cargo transport has also grown 3.5% in the last two years, carrying more than 770,000 tons of cargo in 2016. Analysts expect passenger and cargo transport to grow even more in the coming years, as a number of ambitious redevelopment and expansion plans have been initiated at 52 regional and national airports. The USD2.9 billion plan is intended to upgrade many of country's air transport facilities in an attempt to keep up with growing tourism numbers.</p><p>A notable example of such projects is the new Eldorado II terminal at Eldorado International Airport, which is expected to be completed by 2021. Together, Eldorado I and II will be capable of handling over 69 million passengers a year. Medellí­n's Jose Maria Corova airport and Barranquilla's Ernesto Cortissoz Airport will both see refurbishment and new facilities in the coming years, and Aerocivil hopes to expand the Ernesto Cortissoz Airport's capacity to 7.4 million by 2036. Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport in Cali is already in the midst of a significant USD120 million expansion project, which includes the development of a new 20,000sqm international terminal</p><h4>Seaports and waterways </h4><p>On Colombia's Caribbean coast, the most important ports are in Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Santa Marta, while on the Pacific coast the key ports are in Buenaventura and Tumaco. Buenaventura is currently undergoing a USD250 million expansion and renovation, and Baranquilla and Santa Marta are undergoing USD180 million and USD100 million projects, respectively. Cartagena receives the vast majority of cruise line traffic, with 164 projected to arrive in 2017, while Santa Marta is a distant second with only 14 stops projected.<br>Inland waterways carry only around 3% of the cargo transported in the country, and the two most important routes are the Magdalena and Atrato waterways, which account for 45% and 52% of cargo movement, respectively. The Magdalena waterway is navigable for more than 2,700km, and it serves as an avenue of shipment for petrochemicals, fertilizers, cement, cattle, wood, and machinery. The waterway suffers from underutilization due to transshipment requirements and a lack of dredging, channel improvement, and levy infrastructure. There have, however, been steps taken to improve dredging conditions along certain waterways. Brazilian company Odebrecht is overseeing a USD1 billion project that includes dredging 965km of river in order to connect it with the port in Barranquilla, though recent hurdles are likely to postpone completion of the project.</p><h4>Logistics</h4><p>In the last two years, Colombia gained three spots on the Logistics Performance Index and currently sits at 94th. Colombian logistics have made advances in some of the core competencies assessed by the index. It currently sits 129th in customs, 95th in infrastructure, 103rd in international shipments, 81st in logistics quality and competence, 96th in tracking and tracing, and 78th in timelines. </p><h4>Mass Transit</h4><p>As a result of a strong push by municipal and federal entities, Colombia's public transportation system has seen impressive growth in recent years, and its solutions and initiates have garnered international attention, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). The country's National Urban Transport Program (NUTP) and its utilization of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks have served as a model for surrounding countries. As of last count, the country had initiated six BRT systems in core urban centers under the first generation of NUTP spending. The NUTP's second generation of funding is “bringing context-sensitive transit systems in 13 intermediate-sized cities,“ according to the WEF. The country's most visionary mass transit project is the Bogotá Metro, and current plans call for a network of 28 stations along 27km of track. While initial projections put the cost of the project at around USD7.5 billion and the expected completion date in 2021, observers expect delays.</p><h4>Moto-taxis<br></h4><p>According to the WEF, transportation in Colombia has been revolutionized by the growing ubiquity of motorbikes and the development of a moto-taxi infrastructure. In the country's major urban centers, this form of transport has grown enormously in popularity. Additionally, motorbikes and moto-taxis have put pressure on mass transit systems in smaller urban areas and parts of cities underserved by existing public transport services. In the city of Sincelejo, moto-taxis have already captured 62% of the municipality's transportation market. The drop-off in mass transit ridership has led some policy makers to reimagine ways to incentivize public transport, and integrated networks, greater regulation, concession systems, new buses, GPS tracking, and improved labor conditions for drivers are all being considered, according to the WEF. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/5fb63b84-d0dc-4d55-ac6f-7c715422c02a.jpg","","","","","","","transporting-the-nation","1455","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405b","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides focusing on development issues such as infrastructure, education, public transport, and the reduction of criminality, Medellí­n has pledged to focus on technology as one of the main pillars of the city's evolution. In fact, the digitization and innovative emphasis on its urban planning contributed to Medellí­n capturing the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize in 2016. The Science, Technology and Innovation (CTi) program, for example, has set up a strategic route that will lay the foundations of a cutting-edge Medellí­n until 2021, proposing the development of capabilities to innovate and contribute to the Regional System of Innovation's efficiency and quality. </p><p>In order to encourage, promote and coordinate the research and technological development for the city proposed by the CTi program, the Council of Medellí­n defined its application as public policy. Furthermore, 7% of the ordinary surplus that Empresas Públicas de Medellí­n (EPM) hands over to the municipality of Medellí­n will be used to finance the program. </p><p>In order to carry out the CTi program, the 'Ruta N' complex was built, which consists of a network of 32,000sqm distributed throughout three buildings. The first is dedicated to Hewlett Packard's Global Service Center, the second to the Ruta N corporation (141 companies from 23 countries) and the city's priority innovation projects, and the third to EPM, UNE Telecommunications, and Medellí­n's main universities. </p><p>Ruta N promotes projects like VIVELAB, MEDIATECA, and ÁRTICA, which, respectively, seek to boost digital animation, facilitate access to information on new technology, and test new technological products and services. In addition, the partnership between Ruta N and the Agency for Cooperation and Investment in Medellí­n and the Metropolitan Area (ACI), offers the 'Business Landing' program, an option for foreign companies interested in investing in technology, information, and communications (TICs). This program has generated 2,111 direct jobs since 2012. Summed to this, EPM has recently launched a public lab devoted to work on innovative and futuristic projects. <br></p><p>'District Medellinnovation' is a space in the northern part of Medellí­n, which aims to be the center of a citywide transformation and promotion of innovation.

Although all of its ports have made tremendous strides since privatization in the 1990's, Colombia's Pacific ports—Buenaventura and Tumaco—have long been overshadowed by their flashier Caribbean counterparts due to ailing infrastructure and their status of as two of Colombia's most dangerous cities. Despite being the busiest port in Colombia, moving 16 million tons of cargo in 2015 according to the Superintendencia de Puertos y Transporte, Buenaventura earned its reputation for being the battleground between rival criminal organizations, La Empresa and Los Urabeños, the heirs of prior paramilitary groups.  </p><p>However, the situation is changing for the better. With Colombia's sights on Pacific Rim and East Asian trade, attracting investment and development to the Pacific coast has been a priority for the Santos administration. China has risen to become the most important trade partner after the US; a FTA recently went into effect with South Korea; and another is in the negotiation stage with Japan. More exports leave Colombia from its Caribbean ports, but growing imports from Asia have helped Buenaventura account for roughly 55-60% of the country's total foreign trade volume. In light of these developments, efforts have been made to clean up Buenaventura, and connectivity issues with the rest of the country are slated to be addressed with the massive 4G infrastructure plan. Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested to upgrade the Pacific ports themselves. </p><p>In late 2016, the USD485 million first phase of Buenaventura's Aguadulce Multi-user Container Terminal (AMCT) came online. Connected to the four other terminals of the Buenaventura port, the new 600 meter dock and its four super Post-Panamax cranes are expected to bring the port's total annual capacity from around 400,000 TEUs to 600,000 TEUs. The super Post-Panamax cranes are of utmost importance for increasing the port's competitiveness in handling the largest class of shipping vessels able to cross the recently expanded Panama Canal. The main partners of AMCT are Singapore's PSA and the Philippines' International Container Terminal Services Inc. The second phase of the AMCT will further extend its length to 900m, allowing a capacity of 1.4 million TEUs. While addressing the milestone opening of AMCT, Luis Fernando Andrade hailed the investment for its contributions to the region and the country, citing that it would provide 600 new jobs. <br>Beyond AMCT and the four other operational terminals, the port's ambitious future includes other projects, such as Puerto Solo and Delta Del Rí­o Dagua. </p><p>Puerto Solo, which will be contiguous to the Container Terminal of Buenaventura and Delta del Rí­o Dagua. Approved by the Ministry of Transport in early 2016, Puerto Solo is an estimated USD1.2 billion complex from the Gepsa Group for hydrocarbons, particularly for the regasification of imported LNG and the export of propane-butane. The complex will have a total area of 150ha.</p><p> The Delta del Rí­o Dagua Maritime Terminal is another upcoming project in the Bay of Buenaventura designed to be a mixed-use complex, with capacity to handle a diverse array of items, such as handle liquid fuel, fishery products, and lumber, in addition to hosting an industrial zone. </p><p>With strong support from both the public and private sector, Buenaventura is set to further increase its already important role in the regional and national economy. If its timely investments were to align with a significant reduction in organized crime, a successful post-conflict era, and the completion of the highly ambitious 4G infrastructure plan, the Buenaventura port would be a gamechanger for the country, and will have finally lived up to the weight of its name—Good Fortune. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Colombia is blessed with being the only country in South America with direct access to the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean, but its Pacific ports have long been overshadowed by their flashier Caribbean counterparts.

	It is a period of change in Colombia. The landmark peace deal passed in late 2016 has created conditions favorable to new infrastructure development, and falling oil revenues have impressed upon the nation the importance of a robust digital economy that offers alternatives to commodity exports. Amidst this all, the ICT sector stands ready to play a crucial role in creating the systems and networks needed for sustained long-term growth. Colombia has a fairly well-connected telecoms sector, but, as with many other Latin American countries, connectivity in rural areas lags behind urban centers. Increasing mobile and broadband internet penetration rates and developing new usages of knowledge-based economic thinking are just a few areas where ICT leaders are ready to fully utilize the strengths of one of Latin America's largest and most well-connected countries.
</p><h4>
	CONNECTIVITY
</h4><p>
	Mobile connections have been the most crucial piece of increased internet connectivity rates in recent years, and Colombia is no different. The nation has seen mobile penetration rates skyrocket over the past decade, reaching rates nearly on par with the world's most connected countries. Mobile research firm GSM estimated that Colombia had 31.9 million mobile subscribers in early 2016, a 66% penetration rate that puts it among the leaders in Latin America. While slightly behind nations like Chile (92% penetration rate), Argentina (92%), and Costa Rica (80%), the growth of the sector in recent years has analysts and industry participants excited and fully expecting to reach those figures within the next decade. Looking at the number of total connections paints an even rosier picture. 2015 data from the MinTIC, Colombia's telecoms regulator, shows that the nation had 58.6 million mobile connections in 3Q2016, a number that is 120.5% of the total population. Growth estimates vary, but all are in agreement that the market should continue to grow through 2020 before slowing as the nation reaches full penetration.</p><p>
	Colombia's mobile sector is dominated by two major providers well known throughout Latin America: Claro and Movistar. Claro has the largest market share, but its share has been falling in recent years due to increased competition. Several new providers have appeared in recent years via virtual operators, including Tigo, Virgin Mobile, Movil Exito, and Uff. Mobile regulator MinTIC reported that Claro lost more than 440,000 users from 3Q2015 to 3Q2016; in contrast, Movil Exito added 500,000 users, Movistar added 924,000, and Virgin added 143,000 over the same time frame. 80% of Colombia's cell phone users use prepaid services, a number that reflects the high costs of mobile service for the country's poor. Juan Guillermo Vélez, CEO of Virgin Mobile Colombia, believes the country's size and stability made it an attractive draw for mobile providers. “[Entering] Colombia made perfect sense,"" Vélez told TBY. “It was big enough economically to be relevant and stable enough both politically and economically to remain a safe bet.""</p><p>
	GSE estimates the cost of mobile phone ownership at 21% of income for Colombia's bottom 40%, 10 times that of the cost for the richest 20% of the population. This is one of the highest burdens in Latin America, and with the increasing focus on connectivity and internet access, the need for affordable data plans is a key issue facing the sector. The issue will be particularly important considering the tax reform bill passed in late 2016 that lowered the corporate tax rate but raised the value-added tax rate from 16 to 19%. Consumers have expressed disappointment at the increase, and mobile providers are wary that the changes could reduce demand for affordable phones and data plans. Making matters worse, this comes on the back of a fall in the value of the peso due to the nation's oil exports. As a result, the industry is facing an environment where growth could slow in the short term. “Customer[s] will be paying up to 24% on taxes between the VAT and the consumption tax,"" Vélez told TBY.  “The cost of handsets has been skyrocketing in the last two years due to the exchange rate and the cessation of subsidies, which will only worsen with the new tax reform. This is why we are focusing more on our loyal customer base because consumption of the service as a whole will fall because people who use it are not using it as freely as they used to so it is more out of pocket.""</p><h4>
	LIVE DIGITAL</h4><p>
	Keenly aware of the need to enhance user experiences and develop its digital infrastructure, the Colombian government has been working with mobile phone providers to implement its Vive Digital (“Live Digital"") plan. Launched in 2010 by President Santos, the plan calls for every citizen in Colombia to gain access to the internet to forge a more developed citizenry, reduce poverty rates, and improve economic growth. The Colombian government sees increased access as a pillar of the country's future, noting that increased access is linked to reduced poverty, improved employment options, and social and economic development. The first stage of the Vive Digital plan, which lasted from 2010-2014, focused on upgrading the country's mobile infrastructure. Colombia installed fiber optic cables in more than 800 municipalities and expanded the 4G spectrum, opening it up to operators via a long-awaited auction in 2013. Despite some controversy among mobile networks who felt that they were artificially excluded from bidding for optimum bands, the 4G auction's tender drew USD401 million in proceeds, well above the government's expectations.<br>
	The first four years of the plan have been largely successful in accomplishing the country's goals. Internet connections grew sevenfold from 2 million in 2010 to 14.4 million in 2016, taking the penetration rate from 11% to 27%. More than 95% of the country's municipalities have access to high-speed broadband as a result of the fiber optic network installed, and internet affordability rose as a result of subsidies and increased competition in the market. After Colombia's ICT Minister claimed that all initiatives of the first state of Vive Digital had been accomplished, the second phase of the project began in 2015. Another four-year plan, phase two seeks to offer new service programs built upon this increased connectivity; now that the infrastructure is in place, the goal is to use it to its full potential. Some of the goals of the new Vive Digital plan include increasing the number of internet users to 27 million by the end of 2018, constructing free Wi-Fi hotspots in every municipality, achieving a one-to-one child to computer ratio in schools, and equipping more than 350,000 public school teachers with computers. Colombia's government has also pledged to double the number of people employed in the ICT sector to more than 80,000, solidifying the role of the knowledge-based IT economy as an economic driver in the country.</p><h4>
	INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS</h4><p>
	Across Latin America, innovators are developing new ways to use digital tools to provide public services. Finance, healthcare, education, and entrepreneurship have all been transformed by increased connectivity and access to new technologies, and Colombia is no different. This idea is at the core of the Vive Digital plan, and while work on the government's behalf is still ongoing, several programs have already emerged from the improved infrastructure that has the potential to transform Colombia's economy. Mobile banking is one such example. The sector has been growing exponentially in recent years as smartphone penetration has increased, and developers are working in tandem with Colombia's largest banks to develop mobile banking services. Different services have been launched that focus on micro-loans, SMEs, and rural communities, all of which have the power to increase access to credit and increase stability and growth. In education, along with the aforementioned computer initiatives, the National Service of Learning has partnered with Samsung to develop mobile classrooms to teach vocational skills such as device repair in rural and underdeveloped communities. “The principal aim of [this program] is to utilize our facilities and technology for the betterment of Colombian society,"" Samsung Colombia President Simon Lee told TBY. “[Mobile classrooms] are a great tool to approach the people who live in rural areas like the Amazon or in the mountains.""</p><p>
	Connectivity and the development of new skills will also give the ICT sector a crucial role in helping Colombia move on from its civil conflicts. Alberto Samuel Yohai, President of the Colombian Chamber of Information Technology and Telecommunications (CCIT), expects the ICT industry to help bridge the urban-rural divide in the country and give previously underserved populations a new voice. “CCIT recently struck an agreement with the Ministry of Defense to come in and retrain injured personnel and hopefully find them jobs,"" Yohai told TBY. ""For example, I do not necessarily need a software engineer to have both of their legs or a network engineer to have both of their arms; what I need are good brains and the chance to put people to good use."" Creative solutions like these give the ICT sector immense potential in the years to come, and Colombia's commitment to reaching this potential bodes well for the future of country. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/b818d9ff-6882-4730-ad9b-0aec3e920eb8.jpg","","","","Colombia's IT sector is ready to fulfill its tremendous potential thanks to rising penetration rates and a government committed to finding creative solutions for the nation's problems.","","","new-connections","1451","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405a","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FTZs offer advantages to enterprises, such as an income tax rate of 20% (compared to 34% in non-free trade zone areas), exemption from payroll taxes and VAT in certain cases, and dispensation from custom duties on productive imports. Governmental policies have been focusing on FTZ development in the last decade, easing bureaucratic processes and setting up a special tax framework. The goal of FTZs is to foster development in and around the region of establishment, generating employment and attracting investments in order for Colombia to be internationally competitive in both production and FDI attraction. So far, the strategy is working: in the last 10 years, FTZs received more than USD50 billion in investment.</p><p>Additionally, FTZs are vital to the Colombian economy as they are a strong driver of employment. Colombia has a large and well-educated labor pool with an unemployment rate sitting at 9.4%. In the last 10 years, FTZs generated 250,000 direct jobs; 65,000 of those jobs were created in 2016 alone. Exports from FTZs also went up by 35% between October 2015 and October 2016, reaching USD244.1 million. By every measure—job creation, FDI generation, and exports—the impact of FTZs on the Colombian economy is accelerating, promoting further investment in infrastructure. More generally, FTZs are creating a shift toward economic and financial stabilization at a moment where newfound stability in the country is fragile and needs to be strengthened.<br>On the other hand, some argue that FTZs are creating economic distortion rather than economic stabilization. FTZs favor enterprises created after 2012 and create unfair competition for local SMEs that don't meet the standards for being granted FTZ status. The special border tax regime creates smuggling, and tax avoidance has become more common through manipulation of transfer prices. The FTZ regime is also a difficult one to monitor for the tax administration. FTZs are both limited by and contribute to Colombia's transportation infrastructure imbalance. Transportation infrastructure near the coast is more developed and more reliable. While this makes utilization of these FTZs more expensive, investing in the inner parts of the country can create risks of delay due to the underdevelopment of the road network.</p><p>In the last decade, FTZs have become more common throughout Latin America, with Colombia setting the pace for growth and hosting 25% of FTZs in Latin America. However, FTZs in smaller countries with smaller economies, which are more highly dependent on FTZs, are sometimes more attractive to companies and investors as they offer better financial incentives. Colombia must use other means to attract investors, such as more reliable energy supply, larger and more highly skilled workforce, and capability to support bigger projects, to provide more added value. The Bogotá free trade zone, or Zona Franca Bogotá (ZFB), is one of the most prominent FTZs and the most competitive service and industrial park. ZFB hosts companies across several sectors including industry, logistics, trade, services, and technology.</p><p>With this added value, expectations for the future are high. The government is expected to continue investing in FTZs and to create new ones across the country. Employment in FTZs could double in the next three years and grow exponentially from there.

Of those that have defined the past five years—from social dysfunction and economic stagnation to civil war—perhaps no statement has ambiguously loomed larger than “this is what democracy looks like.“ For miners in Colombia, never has the question been more acute. In the wake of last year's extraordinary breakthrough with the FARC, hopes among most of the world, especially the mining community, were running extremely high. What had been off-limits for five decades and, in some cases for all intents and purposes, since the dawn of time, was now ripe for the picking. Military pacification of vast swathes of the mineral-rich countryside was to seamlessly translate into an equally vigorous commodification of the landscape's untapped resources. Before the demos and judiciary got in the way.</p><p>Following the law of rising expectations to the letter, environmental activists, local residents, and indigenous groups in mining communities across the country have begun opposing major mining initiatives through a series of referendums and ballot initiatives that, somewhat surprisingly, have been overwhelmingly backed by both municipal authorities and the courts. In April, South Africa's AngloGold Ashanti was forced by acourt order to halt its activities at its largest gold exploration project in the country, La Colosa, after residents in the nearby township of Cajamarca voted to ban mining in the area. </p><p>With 14 years of work under its belt and millions invested in the project in central Tolima, a mountainous province southwest of Bogotá, the company had no choice but to swallow this bitter pill and accept the municipality's decision—despite the fact it had invested USD900 million in three projects across Colombia in the past decade. A potentially USD2 billion investment expected to one day yield 28 million ounces of gold, La Colosa was the largest of AngloGold's projects and expected to become one of the most important gold mines in the world. Backed by the mayor and constitutional court, residents argued the mine would harm the local water supply, a claim that AngloGold disputes.</p><p>Tellingly, the Tolima vote was only made possible by a crucial 2016 decision by the constitutional court to overturn the national government's sole power to approve mining concessions. Now mayors and provincial governors have the power to challenge exploration permits, a move that delighted environmentalist and sent chills up the spines of mining firms everywhere from Johannesburg to Canberra.</p><p>To be sure, not everyone is going quietly. Only days before the vote in Cajamarca, Canadian mining conglomerate Gran Colombia Gold filed for damages worth USD700 million from the Colombian government after a court order forced it to halt operations at its Marmato project until further consultations could be held with local communities. This time, however, the dispute in question was not whether, but who, would mine the literal mountain of gold thought to be lurking beneath Marmato—the Canadian conglomerate or the artisanal miners who have inhabited the Antioquian town for centuries. Gran Colombia had acquired the Marmato project after buying Medoro Resources Ltd, another Toronto-based gold mining firm in 2011, and is basing its suit against Bogotá on breaches it claims have been made to the Colombia-Canada free trade agreement also signed that year.</p><p>Nor are they alone. Another Canadian firm, the Halifax-based junior explorer Zonte Metals, is suing the local authorities in Antioquia province for their failure to grant the requisite mining permits for a 30ha site it is scouting in conjunction with AngloGold. In February, a special court granted Zonte the right to proceed with its lawsuit against the local authorities, sending its stock up by 11% the day of its announcement.<br>Whatever the court's decision in these cases, the sooner they come the better. As in love, uncertainty can be a far more expensive externality than upfront rejection. And like jealous lovers, shareholders hate to be kept waiting. At least in part because of these pending legalities, Gran Colombia's stock price has fallen from USD11.50 five years ago to USD0.10 a share today.</p><p>In the case of Gran Colombia, the Ministry of Commerce has until October to decide upon the case; if by then it has yet to resolve the dispute, the Canadian firm will plead its case before the Arbitration Committee of the World Bank.</p><p>It nearly goes without saying, but each of these rulings—or lack thereof—have sent chills down the spine of the Colombian Mining Association (ACM) and the broader international investment community. At the ACM's annual meeting in May, miners warned that each referendum would only embolden further communities to adopt similarly aggressive postures against the industry. Though not all related to mining, there are another 39 popular referendums currently pending, the passage of which seems to be growing by the month. </p><p>In the words of Mateo Restrepo, the Colombian chief executive of Toronto-based Continental Gold, the La Colosa ruling had sent “a disastrous signal“ to potential foreign investors. They also complained that residents were denying themselves billions worth of precious metals that otherwise will merely lie idle in the ground.<br>To be sure, above and beyond debates over who stands to benefit the most from mining projects or whether it is a zero-sum arrangement are broader, thornier questions of national versus municipal versus popular sovereignty; how to best attract healthy and sustainable means of foreign investment; and how to balance the needs of development within the bounds of democratization. After all, there seem to be two competing truths at stake here: on the one hand, only prosperity wrought by some rational appropriation of Colombia's abundant if ever elusive spoils will bring Colombia from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom—and bury the hatchet for dime-a-dozen Marxian rebels and finally end Colombia's belatedly simmering cold war.<br>On the other hand, should the country fail to learn the lessons of a 50-year civil war fought at least as much on the basis of land tenure as anything else, and make the necessary and more equitable distribution of Colombia's bounty, then it risks building its post-conflict house on a social foundation of sand: mining will have to be somewhat as democratically distributed as it is extracted. Not to mention suitably regulated. A string of deaths at illegal gold mines throughout 2017 highlighted the precariousness of much of the industry. As such, the pacification of the countryside must also be accompanied by its formalization—and great leaps forward made in safety standards, exploration, and arbitration. Only a country as creative, resourceful, and quick on the draw as Colombia can meet such a challenge. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mining","dead-in-the-ground-alive-on-arrival","1422","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-09-05T09:50:00.000Z","2017-09-05T09:50:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Road to El Dorado","<p>While Colombia maintains an attractive destination in the medium to long term, the country is coming off a challenging year in the gold mining sector. Although gold exports rose 40.5% in 2016 to USD1.5 billion, the Colombian Mining Association estimates that up to 80% of the country's 2 million ounces of gold production is done illegally. According to a recent Bloomberg report, gold has even surpassed cocaine as a revenue source for armed guerrilla groups such as the ELN. </p><p>However, major recently completed or upcoming mining operations and increased efforts by the public and private sectors to fight against and formalize illegal mining make for a sunnier picture. Projects from AngloGold Ashanti, Antioquia Gold, Continental Gold, and Red Eagle Mining are estimated to produce roughly an additional 650,000 ounces per year between 2017 and 2020.</p><p>The end of 2016 saw Red Eagle Mining's San Ramon project enter production, with expectations for 70,000 ounces in 2017. Further down the pipeline are the Cisnero mine (Antioquia Gold), which has a capacity of 30,000 ounces per year, Gramalote (AngloGold Ashanti/B2 Gold), with up to 350,000 ounces, and Buriticá (Continental Gold), which may have an additional 250,000 ounces. These mines will bolster Colombia's formal mining sector, which consists primarily of Toronto-based Gran Colombia Gold and the local Mineros SA. <br>Despite some of the country's well-documented challenges in mining, there are reasons to be optimistic. For one, there are still many rich untapped resources; AngloGold Ashanti's still-in-development La Colosa project, for example, is considered to be one of the world's largest untapped gold assets, with the potential for anywhere between 800,000-1.2 million ounces per year for 20 years. The security situation in mining areas, which has already made dramatic strides since the early 2000s, is set to become even more stable in light of the peace deal with FARC and the ongoing negotiations with the aforementioned ELN. The conclusion of the peace deal, which consumed much of Colombia's political will and attention, will now allow the government to tackle issues of mining and land regulations that have hindered the sector. </p><p>Colombia is eager to move on from a history of legal issues regarding permits and the protection of mining rights, which the private sector often cites as the major hindrance to doing business in the mining sector. It still faces a slew of international lawsuits, such as the ongoing dispute between Eco Oro Minerals and Colombia over its USD200 million mine in Angostura, though a string of key permit issuances for projects such as Continental Gold's Buriticá in 2016 are evidence that they may be turning a corner. <br></p><p>The security situation, beyond ensuring the safety of existing projects, also unlocks large areas of land previously inaccessible for exploration. The true potential of these areas is still uncertain, but going by geological profiles and proven discoveries near former conflict zones on the Ecuadorian side of the border, there are reasons to be optimistic. Colombia, with its history of natural blessings and manmade curses, is perhaps finally on the road to fabled city of El Dorado. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 has been a mixed and sometimes challenging year for the mining industry in Colombia, especially for gold, due to legal issues, competitiveness, and high volatility in international markets.

"2017-09-05T07:03:00.000Z","2017-09-05T07:03:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Time to Rebuild","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/99647f49-597e-43f4-8d93-5b8e4b5fa62b.jpg","Time to Rebuild","","","","","<p>2016 brought a number of milestone achievements for Colombia's political sector, but it was a different story on the economic side, as the country's 2016 GDP growth rate of 2% was the lowest since the 1.7% posted during the midst of the global financial crises in 2009. Before that, Colombia hadn't posted growth of less than 3% since 2002. This downturn wasn't spread across the economy as a whole, as the contraction of the oil sector due to falling crude prices was the primary culprit. Still, the larger industrial sector was far from immune to the effects of the contraction in oil prices, and one of the primary challenges for its participants was dealing with the wider uncertainty within the market. Confident that the worst is behind them, industry leaders are optimistic about the future of the sector and the wider economy in 2017 and beyond. Projections have predicted growth of around 2.3% as per BBVA and Bancolombia, and a more positive regional environment and increased investment should lead to new opportunities for the sector.</p><h4>RECENT PERFORMANCE</h4><p>Manufacturing accounted for 12.2% of Colombia's GDP in 2015, according to DANE, the government's national statistical agency. Data for 2016 shows that the manufacturing sector posted stronger growth numbers after two slow years; after 1.5% growth in 2014 and 1.8% growth in 2015, industrial manufacturing grew 3.5% YoY in 2016 in sharp contrast to several other sectors of the economy. With this came a 4.2% increase in industrial sales, up from 1.6% in 2015, and a 0.7% increase in industrial employment. Analysts expect industry to continue to grow faster than the economy as a whole in 2017, thanks primarily to increased exports. With 15 free trade agreements that give it access to a market of over 1.5 billion people, Colombia is well integrated into the global export economy. 2016 saw exports drop 13% from USD35.6 billion in 2015 to USD31 billion, but there are reasons for optimism about the state of the market in 2017. The majority of the drop in exports came due to a 21.7% decrease in oil exports; the manufacturing sector dropped 10% as a whole but several sectors within the industry did better, such as transport equipment, which grew 16.6%.</p><p>The manufacturing industry was also further impacted by the Colombian government's efforts to push oil exports in recent years, which led to a drop in the value of the peso against the dollar. While expected to be beneficial for export rates, the wider regional and global economic slowdown has overridden any export gains that might have come with a weaker peso. The US was one of the three export destinations that saw increased trade in 2016, remaining steady at 0.42% growth, while Argentina and Mexico saw increased flows of 17% and 2.5%, respectively. While down from its peak of almost USD22 billion in 2011, the free trade agreement between the US and Colombia and the two countries' longstanding political and economic ties kept the US Colombia's largest trade partner at USD9.87 billion worth of goods. Elsewhere, however, regional turmoil and economic uncertainty saw exports drop in key Latin American and Asian markets. Trade to China was particularly noteworthy, falling 50.2% to USD1.1 billion in the face of decreased demand for raw materials.</p><h4>TEXTILES</h4><p>Colombia's textile industry, perhaps the country's most significant non-oil and mining industry, is an illustrative example of some of the challenges facing the industrial and manufacturing sector as a whole. After making gains over the past three decades thanks to the region's comparative advantages and export quotas that helped give it access to the US and European markets, the sector has struggled to deal with the influx of contraband Chinese fabrics and the end of the quota system. In addition, political shifts in the region have led to decreased access to markets that were previously central to the industry. Exports to Venezuela, for example, were temporarily closed in 2010 over political issues; though they resumed soon afterwards, the textile industry's exports to Venezuela are still well below what they were a decade ago. The fall in textile production is particularly worrisome for the industrial sector and Colombia's economy as a while because of the higher rate of employment in those industries as compared to mining or oil production. Antioquia, responsible for about half of all textile exports, saw some of its largest firms struggle in 2016 as high interest rates, a truckers strike, and new tax policies led to a difficult year for the industry. Still, there is a general consensus that the sector has bottomed out and is ready to grow again. Medellí­n-based giants Coltejer and Fribacito, for example, both posted net losses in 2016, but are optimistic about growth in 2017.</p><p>Carlos Eduardo Botero, President of Inexmoda, explained that the realignment in the sector's export profile in recent years has textile manufacturers working to open new markets. After exports to Venezuela fell, Botero told TBY, “it was difficult to export because our peso was strong due to oil, and our internal market was growing, especially the middle class. The problem is that we did not have… the sophistication needed to export to the US, for example. Therefore, the internal market has been growing 8-10% every year in the last five years but exports have not."" To develop the sector to the extent needed to compete in the lucrative US and EU markets, several top textile manufacturers are investing heavily in new plants and facilities to increase capacity and produce the more sophisticated materials needed for those export markets. Supertex, a Cali-based manufacturer that fabricates for brands including Nike, Adidas, and Under Armor, plans to invest USD10 million in a new Nicaraguan factory, part of a large-scale investment strategy that has seen it spend USD6 million since 2015 on new production machines and software. Already producing more than 800,000 garments per month in its two Colombia plants, Supertex projects growth of 15% in 2017. The solution for the industry will likely involve a focus on higher-value-added products and materials and acknowledging that the industry cannot compete with Chinese and Indian products when it comes to costs alone. It is an issue that textile companies all over Latin America are dealing with, but Colombia's size and preexisting economic relationships leave it well equipped to make the shift and keep the textile industry a key part of the country's economy in the years to come.</p><h4>TAX REFORM</h4><p>An additional issue facing the industrial sector is the passage of new corporate tax reform laws in December 2016. Facing the need to make up for billions of dollars of lost oil revenue, the Colombian legislature passed a bill that raised the VAT from 16% to 19%, added a number of new excise taxes, and strengthened tax evasion penalties. The reform's goal is to increase total revenues and bring the Colombian tax system more in line with the OECD's guidelines. The legislation has a number of provisions that will impact the industrial sector. Most prominently, the corporate income tax will be decreased to an effective rate of 33% in future years. A 6% surcharge in 2017 and an 4% surtax in 2018 will set the effective rates at 40% and 37% in those years, respectively, but the rate after those years well be below the current effective rate of 43%. The law also raises the tax rate on companies located in free trade zones from 15% to 20%.</p><p>The law will reduce the overall tax burden on corporations and increase the portion of tax revenue paid by consumers, moves that many felt were necessary considering the high rate of tax evasion present in informal-sector employment in the country. Industrial leaders are still waiting to see how the reform will fully affect the sector, but early reactions to the reform were largely positive from the supply side. Alfredo Correa Muñoz, President of Grupo Disan, praised the reforms in an interview shortly after their passage. “It is a good reform because it will be structural and favorable to the industry,"" Muñoz told TBY. “It will benefit the country as a whole and will be positive for investment in Colombia."" However, many consumers have expressed disappointment with the increase in the VAT, and industries that rely on consumer demand are waiting to see how the market reacts. The textile industry, for example, is in an uncertain period at the beginning of the year. Overall, though, these tax reforms should allow for increased investment across the industry, improving the ability of several sectors to compete in an international market. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/6867e45f-5af7-444f-8731-c60cbceb108d.jpg","","","","Colombia saw growth slow in 2016 due to economic uncertainty brought about by falling oil prices, but tax reform and improved economic conditions have the sector optimistic about 2017.","","","time-to-rebuild","1537","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Colombia and its National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) have now inked contracts with 22 local and international players, a sharp rise from its first contract in 2004.</p><p>Recognizing that it must compete for investments in the capital-intensive industry, Colombia has added certain key measures and incentives in its latest tax reform. These include the introduction of the Certificate of Tax Reimbursement (CERT), a tax-saving and refund mechanism for all oil companies that carry out exploratory activities for specific investments; a VAT refund for all exploratory activities carried out in offshore areas; and the option to amortize expenses related to investments for exploration, development, and construction of mine, oil, and gas fields, carried out between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2027 by the straight line method over a five-year term. Other strategies beyond the tax reform include the introduction of offshore free trade zones and efforts to simplify the environmental licensing process.</p><p>The early exploratory success is also sure to turn heads internationally. In May 2017, Colombia's 88% state-owned Ecopetrol and US-based Anadarko announced Colombia's largest deepwater gas reserve discovery in 28 years. This massive find has brought relief to the country's energy industry and allayed concerns about declining fossil fuel supplies.</p><p>“We will now be able to secure gas production until 2027,"" stated Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos in a video on Twitter at the time. “This will boost foreign direct investment into the country and maintain the importance of Colombia in the global hydrocarbons market,"" he added.</p><p>The discovery occurred at the Gorgon-1 exploratory well, a component of the Purple Angel block between 3,675m and 4,415m below sea level in the south Caribbean Sea. Its total area, across three different blocks, stands at around 14,000sqkm, half the size of Belgium. The commercial development of this discovery will still take between seven and 10 years to commence. For its part, Anadarko is continuing to explore the high-potential Grand COL area, where it is the 100% operator of Blocks COL1, COL2, COL6, and COL7.<br> “With the existing combination of gas fields in the area, Colombia is opening the door to study the possible development of a cluster specialized in gas production, which will boost the project's profitability and efficiency,"" pointed out Ecopetrol in a press release.</p><p>While this discovery was a major milestone in Colombia's offshore industry, it is only one part of an ambitious year. According to a recent TBY interview with Germán Arce Zapata, the Minister of Energy and Mines, the offshore exploration programs in 2017 will run a total of roughly USD700 million, making it among the largest of any offshore exploration program this year. Successful drilling has already occurred in Kronos and Purple Angel. In total, three deepwater and two shallow-water wells will be drilled by the end of 2017. Other companies beyond Ecopetrol and Anadarko that are drilling this year include Repsol and Petrobras.<br>Regarding how these early successes relate to the long-term outlook, Zapata continued, “If these exploration campaigns in 2017 prove what we and the companies believe, it is a potentially whole new frontier for gas and oil, and the development of offshore will become the biggest bet we will have for 10 years. The potential capacity of resources accounts for multiple times the resources we have today.

"2017-09-05T05:18:00.000Z","2017-09-05T05:18:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Energizing  Development","<p>Colombia's energy landscape is set to change dramatically as it sets out plans to diversify its generation sources. In terms of extraction, production is on the rise following a drop in output as oil prices fell.</p><h4>Electricity</h4><p>Colombia currently has more than 15.7GW of installed generation capacity and generates nearly 53TWh every year. The country's National Interconnected System (SIN) provides energy services to around 96% of the country, while the Non-Interconnected Zones (ZNI) serve the remaining 4%. According to the government, Colombia exported approximately 457GWh of electricity abroad in 2015, and the main export markets are Venezuela, which receives approximately 85% of exports, and Ecuador, which accounts for the remaining 15%. Per capita electricity usage was approximately 1,123kWh in 2015, representing a rise of nearly 100kWh over the previous five years. Total consumption sits at around 49.39 billion kWh. The majority, roughly 70%, of Colombian electricity is produced via hydroelectric plants, while 12% is derived from natural gas and 7% from coal. The government has, however, unveiled initiatives designed to expand the role of renewables in the country's energy portfolio and progress is being made in that direction.</p><p>Following sweeping market reforms in 1994, private industry and government entities have been able to work together to provide electricity to Colombian citizens, and service reliability has improved dramatically. After a further round of regulatory reform in 2003, energy production expanded even further, helping position Colombia as a key electricity producer in the region. </p><p>According to the MaRS Advanced Energy Center, half of Colombia's electricity production is privately owned, and Endesa SA, Gas Natural Fenosa, and Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) are the three largest operators in industry, together controlling almost 65% of the market. By the close of 2017, the Colombia electricity market is expected to reach 59TWh, accounting for a CAGR of 3.9% over the previous five years. The residential sector accounted for the largest share of the electricity industry's revenue, accounting for 41.7% of the marketplace's value, roughly USD2.7 billion, while the industrial sector accounted for around 30%, or USD2 billion, according to the most recently available statistics. Between 2012 and 2017, the market grew by a CAGR of 6.8%.<br>Though the electricity market has been growing, many Colombians still face frequent shortages and interruptions. According to data from the World Bank, Colombian consumers have an average of 18.6 electricity interruptions per year lasting, in total, 17.7 hours. These interruptions erase roughly 1.8% of the market's overall value. Regulatory improvements have, however, served to improve these figures somewhat, and technological advances promise to alleviate the issue even further by allowing firms to optimize their operations. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Federico Echavarrí­a, General Manager of AES Chivor, described his company's investments in new technology and the impact these outlays will have on reliability. “We are trying to develop energy storage, as we believe this will provide an interesting solution to many of the transmission constraints we have in certain parts of Colombia, like the Caribbean coast,"" said Echavarrí­a. By focusing on cutting-edge storage technology, firms like AES hope to make interruptions and poor reliability a thing of the past.</p><h4>Oil</h4><p>Sector restructuring in 2003 and 2012 has improved business conditions in the oil sector, and a number of steps have been taken to attract international investment. In 2014, the oil sector received USD4.8 billion in FDI, representing around 30% of the country's total FDI. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Eduardo Rodriguez Tamayo, Country Chairman of Colombia, Ecuador, Central America &amp; Caribbean for Shell, described the steps the government has been taking to attract foreign firms. “The storyline is quite positive in the sense that the government has taken the right measures to incentivize investment,"" said Tamayo. “These measures include contractual modifications, offshore free trade zones, and contract flexibility. This is precisely what companies are looking for.""</p><p>Though Colombia's oil industry witnessed impressive growth over the last 10 years, the last few years of declining oil prices have hit the industry hard. According to BP's 2016 Statistical Review of World Energy, Colombia has roughly 2.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, representing a decline by around 700 million barrels in the last 10 years. Additionally, Colombia produced nearly 1 million barrels of oil per day in 2015, representing an increase in 1.7% over the previous year. Consumption also increased between 2014 and 2015, jumping 5.6% from 314,00bpd to 331,000bpd. Refinery capacity jumped an astounding 25%, moving from 336,000bpd to 421,000bpd. Refinery throughput, however, dropped, dipping 1.3% from 230,000bpd to 227,000bpd. In 2015, the major export market for Colombian oil was the US, which received 370,000bpd.<br>There are seven key oil pipelines in Colombia. The two longest pipelines are the Ocensa and Cano Limon pipelines, which stretch 832km and 776km, respectively, and are capable of transporting 590,000 and 220,000bpd, respectively. The Alto Magdalena pipeline has a capacity of 9,200bpd while the Colombia Oil pipeline has a capacity of 15,000bpd. The Llanos Orientales pipeline has a capacity of 340,000bpd while the Trasandino pipeline, which stretches for 304km, is capable of transporting 85,000bpd. The USD4.2 billion Oleoducto Bicentenario pipeline project has completed its first phase and is currently capable of transporting 110,000bpd. The country has five major refining facilities, though the majority of Colombia's capacity is represented by the Barrancabermeja-Santander facility (205,000bpd) and the Cartagena refinery (80,000bpd). However, expansion projects are set to expand capacity at both plants to 300,000 and 165,000bpd, respectively.<br>The majority of the country's oil production takes place in the foothills of the Andes and the eastern Amazonian jungles, according to the US Energy Information Administration, though the centrally located Meta Department contains the country's largest producer, the Rubiales oilfield. As global oil prices continue to recover, Colombia's oil sector is expected to bounce back. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Marco Antonio Toledo, President Director of Petrobras Colombia, explained his vision for the coming year, noting that he expects to see a slight rise in prices. “The onshore segment in Colombia should react well to these numbers. Colombia should be able to ramp up by 3-5%,"" said Toledo. As conditions improve across the market, Toledo foresees renewed strength in the sector. “Early success will motivate all the corporations take a step forward and will promote a better environment for operational collaboration. This, in turn, will reduce costs and create a lower cost environment."" As companies seek to further optimize existing infrastructure, government incentives will remain an important part of stimulating growth in the sector.</p><h4>Natural Gas</h4><p>At the end of 2015, Colombia had 136 billion cbm of proven natural gas reserves, the majority of which is located in the Llanos basin. Based on the most recently available data from the Colombian Energy Ministry, Colombia's natural gas production exceeds its consumption by roughly 368 million cbm (11.7 million cbm produced versus 11.3 million consumed). Three companies dominate the natural gas production market in Colombia: Ecopetrol, Equion Energia, and Chevron. As a result of rising domestic demand in a number of areas, the government has been pushing hard to expand production. Currently, there are nearly 4,960km of natural gas pipelines in the country, and the three major lines are the Ballena-Barrancabermeja line, the Barrancabermeja-Nevia-Bogotá line, and the Mariquita-Cali line. The long-term prospects of the sector were given a boost in mid-2017 as Ecopetrol and Anadarko made the largest discovery in 28 years, a development that could allow the country to be energy self-sufficient for decades.</p><h4>Coal</h4><p>Colombia is a major source of coal for the global market, and in 2015 it was the fifth-largest exporter in the world and the largest in South America. According to BP's 2016 Statistical Review of World Energy, Colombia had more than 6.7 billion tons of proven coal reserves, and it produced more than 55 million tons of coal, as measured in tons of oil equivalent, while it consumed only 7 million tons. Coal production is undertaken by private enterprise in Colombia, and the largest producer is the Carbones del Cerrejon (Cerrejon) consortium. The majority of Colombia's coal exports are destined for Europe, South America, and the US, and Colombian coal alone represented almost 80% of American coal imports.</p><h4>Renewables</h4><p>In recent years, Colombia has begun putting more effort into expanding its renewable energy sector. In 2010, Colombia inaugurated a new vision for its renewable energy production, setting a goal of achieving 6.5% on-grid and 30% off-grid non-hydro renewable power consumption by the year 2020. In 2015, the country achieved a 5% clean energy power generation rate nationwide. Additionally, the country has biofuel blending regulations that call for the blending of 10% ethanol with conventional gas and 10% biodiesel with diesel. The government has also agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2030.</p><p>The government has unveiled a series of incentive programs aimed at boosting energy production in renewable areas, including income tax and import duty exemptions, accelerated asset depreciation, and VAT exemptions, among others. With hydro-electricity accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's electrical production, Colombia has dedicated an impressive amount of resources to sustainable energy production practices and technologies. In the coming years, the country hopes to expand its wind and solar capabilities, building out these technologies to help increase the overall reliability of the nation's energy production system. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/86fc4e17-f402-4010-80d6-776c2062bdbc.jpg","","","","","","","energizing-development","1386","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2017-08-25T12:40:00.000Z","2017-08-25T12:40:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Covering Broader Advances","<p>Colombia, a middle-income nation, has enjoyed both sustained economic performance conducive to the rise of a prosperous and young population, and weathered the negative impact of weak commodity pricing. Moreover, it is clear that as the economy benefits from the new peace dividend, insurance and reinsurance penetration will rise in tandem. And meanwhile, insurers are seeking new ways to reach the uninsured, both to boost premiums and mitigate against the disasters that the economy is prone to suffer.</p><h4>Challenges and Solutions</h4><p>Headwinds to insurance penetration growth have been low income, but also a middle class tendency to accumulate assets, rather than buy a policy, and the operating cost of the insurer. Notably, to boost inclusiveness and support local SMEs, the majority of local insurers today are shifting toward mass-market product provision, while Microinsurance Network data shows that over 30% intend to offer microinsurance. Regarding the latter, bancassurance has thus far led the march as most insurance products are purchased from financial institutions. Meanwhile, EY confirms that Latin America in general is also witnessing an explosive digital transformation, whereby in 2015 e-commerce sales leapt 20% to USD50 billion. The digital platform is clearly a key component of the marketing mix, not least for the insurance sector.<br>The region's insurers are also getting leaner for greater efficiency, as penetration gradually inches upward. A natural outcome is mergers, such as that of Colombia's Suramericana, which has purchased British Insurer RSA's Latin America operations to widen its regional footprint. Additionally, Jorge Alberto Zapata Builes, the General Manager of Coomeva Medicina Prepagada, told TBY about the firm's merger with Christus Health, which in 2016 had acquired a 10% stake. “For five years, we have been looking for a strategic international partner (and) Christus wants to strengthen its brand in Colombia, while Coomeva wants to strengthen its position in Mexico, Chile, Peru, and the US.“</p><h4>Catalytic Reform</h4><p>Colombia's mandatory social health insurance resulted from the game-changing healthcare reform package of 1993 aimed at covering the most vulnerable citizens. As an outcome of the country's decentralization, healthcare reform increased the burden sharing of health risk and financing. And while critics charged it with the commercialization of health, an undeniable outcome was a competitive insurance sector. In fact, a decade later insurance coverage among the lowest income group had rocketed 18-fold, albeit off a low base, while coverage among the highest income bracket had seen modest growth of 1.4 times. And by 2008, over 85% of the population had become insured. This said, despite 100% coverage in terms of mandatory insurance, only around 3 million people have voluntary health insurance. Life insurance penetration, meanwhile, is at just 0.79%. However, the universal coverage of the social security system has fostered public awareness of having an insurance product, even if a subsidized one.</p><h4>Building on Peace…</h4><p>The insurance sector can only flourish in an era of restored peace, which has brought macroeconomic credibility; the nation has earned investment-grade status from the major credit rating agencies. In turn, this has rendered foreign investment more appealing. Free trade agreements propelling the economy abroad, too, are generating premiums. The local insurance sector, well regulated by the Financial Superintendence, has consistently witnessed annual growth of around 10% per year, albeit from a humble base. Back in 2013, regulatory amendments made it easier for international players to enter the market. Major players including Zurich and Swiss Re have pitched tents in Colombia, rendering Bogotá a regional insurance hub.<br>...While Mitigating Nature's Wrath<br>A relatively recent entrant of note to the Colombian market is Lloyd's, which set up shop in 2016 to ride the wave of infrastructure investments essential to the ascendancy of any EM. Latin America per se is a core component of Lloyd's Vision 2025 strategy of increased activity in the world's fastest growing markets. As the UK is widely acknowledged as being the world's insurance hub, it follows that Lloyd's has established a local presence as Colombia itself evolves into a regional force.<br>Sometimes one learns from others' misfortunes. Sadly, following the Ecuadorian earthquake of April 2016 a mere 15% of losses—estimated at USD3 billion—were insured. On this theme, a Lloyd's underinsurance report provides a telling, if not chilling, insight into the insurance requirements specific to Colombia's geography. In short, Colombia has an underinsurance gap of USD570 million against natural catastrophe exposure. Furthermore, a Lloyd's City Risk Index study concluded that while Bogotá and Medellí­n would generate USD2.5 trillion in economic growth over the coming decade, they potentially faced USD44 billion of risk from various quarters, with the former city facing USD35.2 billion and the latter USD8.77 billion of risk. This breaks down into the following five threats; earthquake USD15.03 billion, market crash USD14.57 billion, human pandemic USD3.8 billion, terrorism USD2.66 billion, and volcanic activity on USD2.58 billion. In February 2017 the regulator gave the green light to Colombia's earthquake model, which will provide insurers key intelligence on which to base policy for the underwriting of disaster risk.</p><h4>The Landscape<br></h4><p>By law, Colombians may purchase any insurance abroad excepting of Social Security-related coverage, mandatory insurance, or insurance where the insured is a public entity. Sector data reveals that for 9M2016 in Colombia, like Ecuador and Peru, insurance sector performance had decelerated largely on stalled economic growth. In Colombia's case, for the aggregate 12 months ending in September 2016, non-life insurance had generated premiums of COP11.73 trillion on nominal annual growth of 6.7%, having grown 14.9% in 2015. According to Lloyd's, while in 2011 50% of Colombia's reinsurance business was placed in London, the figure as of 2016 had halved. For the period, Colombia's non-life reinsurance market generated healthy premiums of COP3.53 trillion, up 22.1% YoY. </p><p>Yet economic woes have meant a higher reinsurance loss ratio, peaking at 57.9% in August 2016 from a 38% low in July 2015, as the reinsurance market absorbs sector volatility. Total net income of the local insurance sector for 10M2016 was USD505 million up 15.6% YoY by insurance association Fasecolda data. At 40% of total earnings, the life insurance segment printed a 53.1% net profit rise to COP608 billion. Net income in the Property and Casualty (P&amp;C) segment rose 2.8% to COP 253 billion, while net earnings from annuities shed 2.2% to COP653 billion. Overall January-October premiums climbed 10.4% YoY to COP19.3 trillion, headed up by annuities premiums, up 20.8% YoY to COP5.3 billion. Life segment premiums appreciated 10% YoY to COP4.4 billion, while P&amp;C premiums climbed 5.5% to COP9.6 billion. Premiums of the major P&amp;C line, car insurance, rose 12.4% YoY to COP2.4 billion, followed by mandatory traffic accident insurance (SOAT), up17.9% to COP1.7 billion. Meanwhile the density, or premiums per capita, is at around USD150. A BMI report forecasts stellar growth for non-life premiums from USD5 billion in 2016 to USD8.6 billion in 2020. Non-life insurance penetration is penciled in for moderate growth from 1.8% to 1.9%. Life coverage, meanwhile, is forecast accounting for 29% of total premiums by 2020, rising from USD1.9 billion in 2016 to USD3.5 billion.<br>Colombia represents a classic case of a virtuous cycle, where local insurers' robustness encourages international participation, which in turn adds capacity and depth. What's more, as the economy continues to diversify away from commodity dependence, the insurance sector will continue to meet the growing needs of the commercial arena and a more inclusive financial system. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Insurance","covering-broader-advances","1400","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-25T11:31:00.000Z","2017-08-25T11:31:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Seeking Deeper Waters","<p>Through strategic reforms and partnerships, Colombia has been shoring up its investment-grade economy, and its capital markets specifically, to leverage fundamentals such as the peace dividend, its international reach, and a more settled corporate taxation climate that should over the coming terms expedite investment strategy. These both render the economy more resistant to externalities and more appealing to foreign investment, promising market depth. Financial reforms will also mitigate the impact of economic deceleration, where in 2016 GDP rose just 1.6% according to the World Bank.</p><h4>International Prestige Spells Depth</h4><p>Today's Colombian Stock Exchange, Bolsa de Valores of Colombia (BVC), was born of the 2001 merger of three regional stock exchanges in Bogotá, Medellí­n, and Cali, the latter two being more commodities oriented. Since then, landmark steps have been establishing the country as a regional finance hub. On July 22, 2014, the BVC became the 11th member exchange of the United Nation's Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative. <br>Official data indicates that since 2001, FDI in Colombia has risen over 500%, essentially due to the oil and mining sectors. Meanwhile, for the BVC, international activity has been a two-way street. In 2015 the bourse strategically acquired a 51% stake in the outstanding shares of Sophos Banking Solutions, a renowned force in technology solutions and consulting services for the financial and securities industry in Colombia and the region. The deal was effectively the BVC's inroad to the lucrative technology services industry in Latin America, boosting revenues and shareholder value. Then in 2016, the BVC enjoyed one-year leadership of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), having joined the club back in 2004.</p><p>While 89 companies were listed on the BVC in 2008, by mid-2016 the number has declined to 71. As Marí­a Isabella Muñoz, the Executive Director of fund managers ColCapital, noted, while, “The government created a secondary market to incentivize more companies to enter, we have (...) very few issuers (and moreover) concentrated capital markets mainly represented in four pensions funds, which are the key players in the private equity and stock market.“ Indeed, there has been a dearth of IPOs, which has spurred BVC diversification into supplementary business lines.</p><h4>Clear and Diverse Appeal</h4><p>Juan Pablo Córdoba, President of BVC, is confident of the bourse's future, drawing attention in a TBY interview to catalysts of investor sentiment. “Colombia has been doing an excellent job of differentiating itself and coming back from a relatively hidden position.“ Foreign investors account for over 30% of the volume traded on the bourse “whereas they were nonexistent eight years ago.“ Similarly, “in the fixed-income market, and especially in government bonds, more than 30% of the stock is today in the hands of foreign investors, compared to 2% five years ago.“ Muñoz revealed that today there are “90 funds operating across Colombia managed by 55 fund managers, 55% of which are local and 45% international.“ <br>“Granted,“ says Mauricio Saldarriaga Navarro, Partner &amp; Executive VP Inverlink, adopting a macro perspective, “the past two or three years have seen a transition from 5 or 6% annual GDP growth to something closer to 2%.“ Yet, he goes on to add, “as the third-largest market in Latin America, Colombia has a great structural relevance for investors.“ The WB anticipates 2.5% GDP growth for 2017, which well exceeds the forecast 1.2% growth for the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region overall. Meanwhile, currency turbulence over the past year or so has positive implications for those in FX. “The peso has depreciated over 50% against the US dollar, (which is) also why valuation multiples are much more reasonable today,“ making for “a great entry point.“</p><h4>MILA</h4><p>The BVC's key regional maneuver came in 2009 when merged with Argentinean and Peruvian counterparts in the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA). This standardized the trading and settlement activities of the three markets. Mexico's stock exchange joined MILA in 2014  to foster mutual trade and investment along Latin America's Pacific coast, and by 2016 the MILA system was an established contender for Brazil's Bovespa. The S&amp;P MILA Andean 40 index gauges the performance of the 40 largest and most liquid stocks in the Andean region (Chile, Colombia, and Peru) that trade on the MILA platform. Launched on August 20, 2011, as of April 16, 2017 the index had posted a one-year return of 16.83%.</p><h4>Some Numbers</h4><p>The market capitalization (MCap) of listed companies, at a stellar 72.6% of GDP in 2010, had declined heavily to just 29.4% by 2015 amid global volatility. The bourse has duly raised its game to appease the investor community, notably adopting the NASDAQ X-Stream INET trading platform in 2017, enabling sophisticated algorithmic and high frequency trading. According to Index Mundi, the most recent print for the MCap of listed domestic companies was at USD86 billion as of 2015, down from USD262.10 billion in 2012, yet well above the 2005 level of USD50.5 billion.</p><p>For 2016 overall revenues of the BVC came in at COP161.4 billion, soaring 43% YoY, with 17% generated beyond Colombia. Total net profit of COP33 billion had climbed 22%, while profitability was evident in the consolidated EBITDA leap of 35% to COP52.9 billion; the consolidated EBITDA margin was 34%. In a good year for the bourse thanks to its diversified financial service portfolio, non-trading revenues appreciated 50%, while trading revenues rose 11%, those of subsidiaries providing leading-edge technical services by 53%, and BVC revenues by 15%. In 2016 the corporate bond market, too, gave a good show, with 65% YoY issuance growth to COP 10 billion. According to the BVC, that market should remain robust in 2017 given lower interest rates. Indeed, at its March 2017 meeting, the Central Bank of Colombia is expected cut the benchmark interest rate by 25bps to 7%. This followed the 25bps cut of February, producing the lowest rate in a year.</p><p>As of February 2017, foreign investment accounted for 43% of stock ownership, while the BVC's 20 leading shareholders accounted for around 72% of the total. Those are followed by brokerage firms of 15% and pension funds on 14%, with the remainder divided among retail investors and real sector funds. From 2008-2016, the capital markets had posted a CAGR of 5%, derivatives growth of 38%, FX growth of 10%, and growth in the equity market of 3%, while fixed-income instruments had shed 4%. Overall capital markets revenue was COP52.1 billion for 2016 broke down into COP12.4 billion from fixed income, COP16.8 billion from equity market, COP7.2 billion from FX, and COP15.8 billion from derivatives transactions. In the equities arena, the benchmark COLCAP index shed 11.2% YoY in 2016, not as bad as the 18.3% decline of 2014, but a far cry from the 2012 leap of 53% YoY. As of April 21, the index had fallen one point or 0.07% to 1,362 from 1,363 in the previous trading session. Historically, the index printed a high of 1940.38 in November of 2010 and a low of 1051.25 in December of 2015.</p><p>Colombia's capital markets will remain dependent on sentiment toward the broader economy. Yet there, the government's likely meeting of its 2017 fiscal target due to tax reform will bolster investors' appetites, while higher oil prices and a sizable infrastructure portfolio should galvanize growth momentum. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Capital Markets","seeking-deeper-waters","1433","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-25T10:33:00.000Z","2017-08-25T10:33:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Winds of Change","<p>Back in 1499, Spanish navigator Juan de La Costa named a remote South American promontory Cabo de la Vela, or Cape of Sails. Allegedly, he was so impressed by the winds swirling over its wild territories that the designation came almost automatically. Five centuries later, those lands may no more belong to the Spanish Kingdom, but wind could be just as relevant as it used to be for Queen Isabel's caravels.</p><p>The Colombian department of La Guajira, in which Cabo de la Vela is located, is home to the first and only major green energy project in the country's history under the UN's Clean Development Program. According to the Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Luis Gilberto Murillo, the government is planning to further establish seven major solar and wind projects that alone could power all of Colombia.<br>One of the largest wind projects in the pipeline is the Jouktai Wind Farm, developed by ISAGEN and with a potential of 31.5MW, which required an initial funding of USD60 million. Moreover, the Ipapure Wind Farm project, with an estimated initial capacity of 200MW, recently finished its preliminary control and is also expected to start operating in the short term. If implemented and properly supported, these investments will add to Carrizal, Casa Electrica, and Irraipa, three wind power projects registered in 2015 that will produce 474MW, according to IPD Latin America.</p><p>Wind is not the only precious asset La Guajira has to offer. The region offers the best solar resource, with 6kWh per sqm of radiation compared to a national average of 4.5kWh per sqm. More specifically, the most substantial potential for large-scale solar generation is to be found in the Orinoco and San Andrés areas, in the northern part of the country. It is here, unsurprisingly, that both the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Institute of Planning and Promotion of Energy Solutions for non-interconnected zones (IPSE) have been implementing a series of photovoltaic systems to exploit the peninsula's privileged status.</p><p>However, rigid financing schemes are still seen as the major barrier for foreign investors who are not familiar with the region. The central government will thus be charged with crafting a comprehensive regulatory framework that sets the precedent for future transactions. Indeed, local banks and multilateral consortiums cannot rely solely on the Financial Support Fund for Energy Provision in Non-Interconnected Zones (FAER) created in 2000. While this fund has proven to be an important tool for the financing of projects in areas not connected to the national grid, it still lacks a far-reaching incentives scheme that facilitates fast capitalization.<br>In this sense, a crucial regulative step was made in May 2014 with Law 1715, which guaranteed the removal of value-added tax and tariffs on imports for green energy projects, along with a favorable tax scheme in the medium run for firm's assets. The law fell into the wider three-year National Development Plan launched in 2014, through which the government places green growth at the heart of a long-term sustainable development strategy.</p><p>Overall, the Latin American renewable energy market remains widely untapped, with Mexico and Brazil leading the way by building turbine infrastructure and thoroughly studying the European model of harnessing wind, according to Ramón Fiestas, chairman of the Global Wind Energy Council's Latin American Committee.<br>With only 1% of power supplied by wind, solar, and other renewable sources, Colombia seeks to bridge the gap with the other two major regional players. Far from the major cities of Colombia's interior, potable water is scarce in La Guajira and electricity is a luxury. Yet, it is from this remote peninsula that the winds of change are blowing. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LA GUAJIRA","winds-of-change-colombia-2017","1721","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58f615b486b7b00ce8946aa8","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-25T10:12:00.000Z","2017-08-25T10:12:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Green on Green","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/e28d8c77-05e2-424e-b90a-391c6068aa4f.jpg","Green on Green","","","","","<p>Despite the unceremonious manner in which it eked out its famous peace deal in the final stages of the year, Colombia was in many ways the global darling of 2016. Its president Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a week before losing the infamous (first-round) referendum, while The Economist named it country of the year for similar reasons. </p><p>Yet if great privilege truly entails great responsibility, then even greater challenges lie ahead. A land of immense natural resources, the country's development can no longer be delayed due to internal security concerns. Spending must shift from soldiering to more permanent forms of statecraft, such as transport networks. Extensive new road and rail networks must be laid, and riverways such as the Magdalena modernized. Once these are furnished, the real struggles can begin: the long, hard, uphill slog to educate, employ, accommodate, and care for nearly 50 million people scattered across more than 1.14 million sqm of mountain, jungle, and desert.</p><p>As elsewhere, central to each of the state's efforts to “win the peace“ will be the question of energy. The fourth-largest exporter of coal in the world and the fourth-largest exporter of oil in Latin America, Colombia has been blessed with carbon, which can be as much a curse as a benediction if certain precautions are not taken. For one, the country's growth, tax base, and currency grew wildly reliant upon the price of crude: when the latter began to collapse in 2014, the results were swift and far-reaching.</p><p>Government revenues from oil fell by 60% in 12 months; reliant for nearly 20% of its budget on oil, the state saw a budget gap of 3.9% of GDP in 2016 and has projected another 3.3% gap in 2017. Meanwhile, the peso tanked by more than 50% in 2015-16 and has barely picked up since. While this has strengthened domestic exports, it has greatly increased the cost of importing environmentally friendly technologies critical to making the long-term transition to greener, sustainable sources of energy. To top it off, domestic and foreign firms have made next to no new oil discoveries in recent years, and production at the country's largest well, Rubiales, has been scaled down.<br>The writing from pretty much every indicator is on the wall: if Colombia is to survive and thrive in the 21st century—conditions that are rapidly becoming mutually necessary—it must not only diversify away from carbon, but do so soon. All the better for it to so whilst the political momentum and physical capital to develop a robust green economy are on its side. For an underdeveloped country with extraordinary biodiversity, it would be folly not to.</p><h4>Green Grows the Grass</h4><p>Which is precisely what the country's political leadership has set out to do. On February 1, President Santos and Simón Gaviria, head of arguably the nation's most important institution, the National Planning Department (DNP), launched the Green Growth Mission (Misión de Crecimiento Verde). An ambitious initiative designed to boost growth both along more energy-sustainable and geographically equitable lines, the plan takes much of its inspiration from several admonishments in an earlier OECD report, Evaluating Colombia's Environmental Performance 2014.</p><p>Headed by economist Hernando José Gómez Restrepo, Colombia's Minister of Economic Planning, the move is part of the country's broader accession process to join the OECD, the 35-member “rich country club“ with which Colombia began formal membership talks in 2013, and which has only accepted two Latin American countries in its history: Mexico in 1994 and Chile in 2010. To accede to the club would be a prestigious boon, to actually implement its environmental recommendations all the more beneficial in the long term. <br>Slated to make it the greenest economy in Latin America by 2030, Green Growth hopes to fundamentally restructure much of the Colombian economy's architecture. For one, growth without sustainability will henceforth be shunned. To do this, Green Growth will enforce a stronger environmental licensing scheme for industries whose activities affect the environment. Second, environmental licensing will grow more stringent. Third, far greater emphasis will be placed on reducing inefficiencies in water, soil, energy, and primary materials. And fourth, a large concerted effort will be made to make the bio-economy not only proficient, but also export oriented and big enough to create a green workforce.<br>To do so, the government included a significant carbon tax in its tax reform and announced plans to double the amount of protected land in the country to more than 26 million ha, including the creation of two new national parks. As part of its growing efforts to play a larger role in the international community, Colombia also joined the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020. Hosted by the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the alliance is a global public-private partnership aiming to drastically reduce deforestation, especially in the production of commodities such as soy, beef, palm oil, and pulp.</p><p>To be sure, Green Growth is far from the only means the state has used in recent years to spur the development of a green economy. In 2014, it unveiled Law 1715, which promotes the implementation of clean energy projects across various sectors (wind, solar, hydro) through creating new tax and accounting benefits, implementing new technical standards, eliminating import duties on equipment related to green energy, and establishing the first legal mechanism for firms and households to sell excess energy back to the grid. Though complaints have been made about the bureaucratic leaps involved in taking advantage of said benefits, most analysts agree it is a big step in the right direction. </p><p>Though Colombia generates two-thirds of its electricity from hydropower, there are signs that this will not be as reliable a source in the future due to long-term climate change and the increasing drought that certain parts of the country are already experiencing, particularly on the Caribbean coast. For one, an alarming report from late 2015 places both Cartagena and Barranquilla in the top 25 of 1,300 cities around the world that face the biggest potential productivity losses from climate-related changes. Colombia's Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies (IDEAM) has also predicted that shifting weather patterns will bring reduced rains in the longer term, making the push to solar all the more logical and necessary.<br>Under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), the country recently adopted an aggressive Indicative Action Plan, which is targeting 3.5% on-grid and 20% off-grid renewable energy by 2015 and 6.5% and 30% by 2020. To do so, it will have to rather liberally increase solar, wind, and biofuel production in the coming years.</p><h4>Solar</h4><p>Despite critical barriers such as the devalued peso's ability to import expensive dollar- and euro-denominated photovoltaic equipment (an expense that even Law 1715 could not forestall), the country is rapidly moving forward. The first solar plant in the country is slated to be fully operational by the third quarter of 2017. A 9.9MW photovoltaic plant consisting of some 35,000 PV modules set across 18ha, Celsia is expected to generate 16GWh of power per year and meet the energy needs of 8,000 local homes. Set in the municipality of Yumbo in the southwest province of Valle del Cauca and just north of Cali, Colombia's first solar plant rather fittingly lies on land previously occupied by the Termoyumbo coal plant, closed for 20 years now.</p><p>The firm and namesake of the product, the Medellí­n-based Celsia, is currently developing four other solar projects in Colombia, in Valle del Cauca, Bolí­var, and Santander provinces, and one in Panama. If successful in Yumbo, it hopes to use the latter as a springboard for other PV projects throughout the country and region. Prior to Celsia's debut, the largest PV arrays in Colombia were commercial rooftops that supplied several hundred kilowatts' worth of energy, compared to Yumbo's expected 16GWh. That being said, it is not the only firm to have taken off in the past 18 months. As of December 2016, 160 solar projects with a total generating capacity of 1.2GWh were registered across the country. Compared to the 120MW registered in February of that year, solar projects saw a 1,000% increase last year alone.</p><h4>Wind and Biofuels</h4><p>With a strong whiff of optimism, various reports have also shown that Colombia's entire energy needs could be met by wind alone. The northern Caribbean province of La Guajira, for example, better known as home to the Wayuu people and a variety of world-class smugglers, is also thought to harbor some 21GW of wind capacity. Ranked a class 7 (somewhere around 10m per second), it is one of the windiest regions in all of Latin America and one of only two in the entire region to reach that speed. The country's first operational wind farm, Jepirachi, is also located in La Guajira, though many also see the northern Orinoco and San Andrés regions as two other suitable locations to build wind farms. A USD27 million project spanning 220ha that began in 2001, Jepirachi is also seen as a landmark development for the enlightened, open-minded, and democratic manner in which it consulted with the local Wayuu people whilst constructing it. As such, the 19.5MW project thought to benefit some 120,000 people will serve as an example of “green growth“ going ahead.</p><p>Biomass is also thought to be a useful, if less bounteous, source of renewable energy in Colombia. After all, the natural refuse of agriculture waste is abundant in this part of the world: from coffee, banana, and rice plantations to the country's vast livestock holdings, biomass is one of the country's most plentiful resources, from the Caribbean and Norte de Santander in the north to Llanos Orientales in the east and Valle del Cauca in the southwest. One important plant, Ingenio Mayagüez, interestingly got its start as one of the country's largest sugar cane producer. After a 2007 law pushed through by then-president Alvaro Uribe required 10% of all petrol sold in the nation's gas stations to be derived from ethanol, the race to diversify away from sugar alone was on. </p><p>Though that law has been scaled back to 8% as a result of pushback from the petroleum industry, it set an important precedent: what began as a sugar plantation and soon transformed itself into an ethanol manufacturer quickly became the country's first biomass co-generation plant, with a rate of 37MWh per day. If the state can encourage and coordinate this creative resourceful dynamism on a much vaster scale, Colombia is well poised to meet a significant proportion of its energy needs through renewables by 2030. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/e6a14e3a-2e67-4831-8a1a-81fbbfe508dc.jpg","","","","","","","green-on-green","1332","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58f615b486b7b00ce8946aa8","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-25T09:40:00.000Z","2017-08-25T09:40:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Digging a Little Deeper","<p>Colombia's economic growth decelerated to just 2% in 2016, as it faced a further term of trade shock due to commodity price slumps and the perennial El Niño effect, with a repeat performance foreseen for 2017. According to Juan Carlos Mora Uribe, the CEO of Bancolombia, Colombia's largest bank, “[while] we are positive about 2017, it is (...) a transition into 2018—then we will see bigger growth."" Likewise, Juan José Echavarrí­a, the Governor of the Central Bank of Colombia (BRC), explained to TBY that while “2017 will outperform 2016, growth rates close to 2% are not enough, and Colombia has to regain the rates of 4%-4.5% reached over the past 15 years.""</p><p>The BRC, established in 1923, oversees monetary policy supportive of economic policies that foster growth of production and employment. On April 29, 2017 it cut its key interest rate by 0.5ppts, confirming to the analyst community that the economy would need assistance to return to a desired growth path, citing the risk of an excessive slowdown. </p><p>Subsequent cuts, it stressed, would again be determined by a balance of risks between gradual inflation reduction to the targeted 3% and unwarranted economic deceleration. Inflation had peaked once oil and other commodity prices tanked, whereby foreign investors turned away from Colombia's natural resources. In consequence, the peso slid, while inflation became problematic. In March the central bank cut the policy rate by 25bps to 7%. Yet the banking system has withstood local torpor and global woes, while reaping renewed interest in emerging markets. And in step with the peace dividend and any improvement in broader macro conditions, such as higher employment and consumer confidence, the sector stands to benefit from as-yet-untapped participation.</p><h4>Brief Sectoral Overview</h4><p>Today's concentrated banking system is dominated by five players, which by the end of 2016 had the following market shares by gross loans and deposits, respectively: Bancolombia (25.2%/22.7%), Banco de Bogotá (13.1%/14.1%), Davivienda (14.4%/12.9%), BBVA (10%/11.6%), and Banco de Occidente (67/6%). As of 2016 the bank capital-to-assets ratio was at 16.1%, up from 14.1% in 2015. For the banking system overall in 2015, official data reveals that in terms of capital adequacy the regulatory capital-to-risk-weighted-assets ratio was at 16.6% compared to 17% in 2014. By asset quality measures, the non-performing-loans-to-gross-loans ratio was at 3% (2.9%), provisions to non-performing loans at 148.3% (151.3%), and gross loans to assets 69.6% (69.3%). And by liquidity metrics, the liquid-assets-to-total-assets ratio was at 18.9% (19.8%), while the deposit-to-loan ratio was at 88.8% (91.6%).</p><p>The provision of checking accounts is the exclusive reserve of commercial banks, with certain institutions specializing as mortgage banks. Commercial banks dominate the financial universe, on more than 80% of total financial system assets. A glance back at turbulent times reveals a scythe mowing through a larger number of players. In fact, subsequent to the 1998-1999 financial crises, close to half of banking and non-banking institutions went to the wall, were taken over, or obliged to merge. Then, 2009 legislation entitled eligible foreign banks and insurance companies to operate locally without incorporating a Colombian entity, by opening a branch in Colombia. Foreign entities perceiving longer-term dividends thus entered the fray, boosting competition and prompting official efforts to regulate the sector for a sustainable future. In January 2012, Canada's Scotiabank spent USD1 billion to buy Colpatria Bank. Additionally, Helm Bank was bought for USD1.3 billion by Chilean group Corpbanca in late 2012. Foreign bank assets as percentage of total bank assets according to the Global Financial Development Database averaged 13.3% between 2004 and 2013, with a low of 10% in 2004 and a peak of 20% in 2005. Additionally, the predictability of the local banking system has enabled its regional footprint to grow, whereby Colombian banks have diversified their income streams.</p><h4>And Other Catalysts</h4><p>The government is activating game-changing infrastructure spending such as the 4G road scheme, the largest in Latin America, which would stimulate the financial sector. Related investments are earmarked at USD3.2 billion this year, and infrastructure programs will remain the primary driver of lending growth throughout 2017 and 2018. Notably, the preference in the Andean markets to fund such schemes through the banking system, rather than the capital markets, tends to squeeze liquidity amid the cost of funding. Meanwhile, private-sector investment may be shelved ahead of the May 2018 presidential elections to observe the outcome.</p><h4>Ratings</h4><p>Any financial system benefits from healthy national ratings, with the reverse also holding true. In early 2017, Fitch joined S&amp;P in attaching a “negative"" outlook to Colombia's financial system. In 2016 Fitch had downgraded Colombian banks, including Corpbanca Colombia, Bancolombia, and Banco de Bogotá, citing a rising current account deficit (6.4% of GDP in 2015), high external debt at 37% of GDP, and a widening central government deficit—up to 3.9% of GDP in 2016 from 3.1% in 2015. Moody's had downgraded its banking system outlook to negative in July 2016 in the wake of low oil and commodity prices denting the economy and reducing banks' ability to retain earnings as costs of lending rose.</p><h4>Regulation</h4><p>The Financial Superintendence (SFC), which regulates both Colombia's banking system and capital markets, disputed the Fitch downgrade, insistent that financial regulation was the most rigorous in the region and citing sector solvency of 15.46% in 4Q2016, despite a regulatory minimum of just 9%. Indeed, financial system oversight has been a cornerstone of its evolution. Financial sector reform in 2009 boosted customer protection and transparency, whereby, for instance, the associated costs of banks' operations had to be declared. Gone, too, were the days when the consumer bore the burden of proof in any dispute with the banks. In 2014 the SFC's strategic guidelines for 2015-18 highlighted institutional capacity building contingent upon a better educated workforce, checks and balances of financial conglomerates, and tangible success in instituting the Basel II and Basel III regulatory frameworks. Elsewhere, current regulations stipulate a cap on interest rates for loans imposed by the SFC with fines imposed on violators to stimulate credit activity. As of June 2016 the ratio of total loans to GDP was at 50.6%, while the ratio for consumer loans to GDP was 12.96%, for commercial loans to GDP was 28.95%, and for mortgages was 7.03%. In 2015, and in a first among EMs, Colombia voluntarily undertook a pilot self-assessment under the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution for Financial Institutions program, conducted by the IMF, the FSB, and the World Bank.</p><h4>Sector Depth through Inclusion...</h4><p>Back in 2012, Colombia became a signatory to the Alliance for Financial Inclusion's “Maya Declaration,"" an international initiative tasked with unlocking “the economic and social potential"" of the estimated 2 billion unbanked people across the world. Two years later President Santos initiated a national financial inclusion strategy cemented in law in 2015 through decrees 2338 and 1491. The SFC's strategic guidelines for 2015-18 also target greater formal financial inclusion among low-income Colombians. Just 39% of adults have a formal bank account, while for women the figure drops to less than 35%.</p><p>Persistently low credit penetration is evident in the fact that while 70% of people have a savings account at a main bank, 50% had taken out a loan and 52% a credit card with the same bank as of 2014. Liquidity concerns require a deepening of the banking sector if credit is to become more appealing to the millions of people not banked in the formal banking system. Yet consumer confidence, too, will need to firm up given persistently high unemployment of over 11% in January 2017. As of December 2016, commercial credit had risen by 11.4%, consumer credit by 13.2%, and mortgages by 15.1% YoY, together making for an annual rise of 12.2%. Bank credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP according to the World Bank averaged 28.07% from 1960 to 2015, troughing at 17.55% in 1973 and peaking at 47.11% in 2015.</p><p>Banco de Bogotá, branded as a “Bank for All,"" is set to extend its Route to Financial Inclusion literacy program in 2017 to a further 50 municipalities through a mobile office initiative to rural areas. Since 2008 the bank has extended around 125,000 microloans at an averaging COP5 million. Around 10% of recipients had no previous contact with the formal banking system.</p><p>Elsewhere, Luis Enrique Dussán, President of Banco Agrario de Colombia, the country's sole state bank, explained its transition to a development bank. As the name implies, the bank is geared towards developing the agricultural sector, one of the largest in Colombia. And given the importance of the peace dividend, he notes that “The Colombian conflict was actually born in the rural areas because of the differences in the distribution of land."" Therefore, “giving the rural population access to credit will help the development of the entire country.""</p><h4>...And Innovation </h4><p>International think tank the Brookings Institution ranked Colombia second in its 2016 Financial and Digital Inclusion Project Report, with a score of 100% regarding its commitment to financial inclusion, while the regulatory environment scored an impressive 89%. At the institutional level, on May 11, 2017 Canadian financial services giant Scotiabank garnered the Latin American Retail Bank of the Year Award from Retail Banker International (RBI), notably for digital innovation. Bancolombia CEO Uribe explained how “digital innovation and customer experience are central to our innovation strategy."" For 2017, related projects include a completely digital bank called Nequi. </p><p>Sector research indicates that by 2018, 20% of all smartphones worldwide will feature a mobile wallet facility. Colombia stands to rank well on this front, as Ministry for ICT data points to 2.5 million people actively engaged in digital money management. Colombia also ranks third in Latin America in smartphone transaction volume after Brazil and Mexico. The Financial Superintendence puts 2014 mobile banking growth at a staggering 334%, thus becoming the swiftest-growing banking service sector. Broadening the range, Banco Agrario de Colombia has launched an application that does not require a smartphone.<br>In conclusion, then, Colombia's banking sector is well regulated, but must further tap the unbanked for depth, while peace could yield medium-term dividends. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/1ac19640-1f7e-4a37-bb30-d9501960fdd2.jpg","","","","Colombia's concentrated banking sector, where the top five institutions hold roughly 60% of total assets, is well regulated so as to withstand external headwinds, but remains underpenetrated.","","Banking","digging-a-little-deeper","1429","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A member of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), the Andean Community (CAN), and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), Colombia is intimately acquainted with the challenges and rewards that come with regional integration. </p><p>Founded in 1969, the Andean Community is one of the oldest regional communities in Latin America. It is a trade bloc composed of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru; Venezuela withdrew its membership in 2006. CAN is an intergovernmental agency focused on economic policy, trade, and a shared agenda in the goal of linking the member countries and forming unified policies that benefit all countries. Rich in natural and economic resources, CAN has a total population of over 100 million, a combined GDP of over USD580 billion, and is home to 20% of the planet's biodiversity. The Andean community's governing body is the Andean Parliament, which consists of four elected representatives from each country. </p><p>The Andean Community's key focus recently has been on trade deals and economic integration. The community established the Andean Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 1993, which took landmark steps towards the elimination of customs tariffs. Additional efforts toward economic integration followed in recent years, with the creation of a common market in 2004 and the creation of common tariff policies shortly thereafter. Individual countries retain the right to make specific trade deals that are in their best interests, but emphasis is made on linking decisions to create a fair and equal market. Moreover, the community allows for free movement of workers within countries with the Andean Migration Card established in 2007.</p><p>Colombia has long been at the forefront of CAN's operations and taken an active in role in the formation of policy, but recent trade deals with the EU have led to tensions within CAN. In 2012, the EU signed a comprehensive trade agreement with Colombia and Peru, with Ecuador added to the agreement in 2014. At the beginning of original negotiations with the EU, Ecuador and Bolivia expressed concerns that the proposed agreement was too favorable to the EU and included provisions that would be difficult for the smaller countries to meet. As a stable and prosperous country with well-developed national industries, Colombia and Peru can make agreements that would be onerous for Ecuadorian and Bolivian national industries. </p><p>Though Ecuador joined in 2014, Bolivia remains a holdout and, as a result, is unable to export products to the European market. This is a continuing source of tension within CAN. Moving forward, Colombia will need to take care to balance the needs of member countries' different development levels as they look to form new regional trade agreements with the Asian market.</p><p>UNASUR is a more recent regional organization with similar aims. With membership consisting of every independent South American nation, UNASUR was formed in 2011 as the result of years of work to further regional integration. UNASUR's primary actions are economic development efforts through the Bank of the South, its credit institution. The group also coordinates on border controls, infrastructure, and defense policy. This last topic has been a point of contention for Colombia, which originally refused to join UNASUR's defense council because of its preexisting military ties with the US. Although it resolved those issues and joined the organization, the country's ties with the US military continue to generate tension within the regional organization. Colombia announced in December 2016 preliminary talks with NATO in the hopes of becoming a full member, drawing the ire of regional leaders who view this as a violation of the declaration of Latin America as a peaceful zone.</p><p>Colombia's entry into NATO is still very much in the future, but as with its economic policy, the nation appears to be reaching a crossroads between its global ambitions and regional responsibilities. The challenge will be to integrate itself into the global economy, provide peace and stability, and balance its needs with the needs and responsibilities of its fellow members in regional organizations. After decades of work that have gone into increased regional integration, the best move will likely involve compromise to maintain good relationships with its neighbors. Charity begins at home, as the saying goes, and Colombia knows well enough that it stands to benefit from a strong and unified Latin America. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Colombia will need to balance its desire to form new global trade and military relationships with its regional commitments in Latin and South America.","","Regional Integration","no-land-is-an-island","1623","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The year brought a landmark peace deal that ended Latin America's longest-running civil conflict and new milestones in poverty reduction and infrastructure access in rural communities. Yet Colombia also saw GDP growth drop to the lowest rate since 2009 due to falling oil prices and regional instability, which has contributed to a Latin America-wide slowdown. Growth projections for 2017, while below pre-2016 levels, are up slightly, and there's reason for broader optimism about the state of the country. Strong government leadership has tempered social issues and brought down the inflation rate ahead of international projections, giving regional and international investors the confidence that Colombia will remain an economic force for years to come.</p><h4>2016 IN REVIEW</h4><p>Before 2017, Colombia's economy had been one of Latin America's greatest success stories over the past 15 years. Annual GDP growth averaged 4.58% from 2005 through 2015, hitting a low of 1.65% in 2009 in the midst of the global economic downturn but remaining at well over 3% for the bulk of the decade. Most of this was powered by petroleum, which accounted for around two-thirds of all export earnings over this time frame. Over the last two years, however, the fall in crude oil prices has dramatically decreased Colombia's revenues from these exports, setting off an interconnected chain of events that has led to decreased GDP growth in each of the past three years. After posting growth of 4.39% in 2014, GDP growth fell to 3.08% in 2015 and then 2% in 2016. Before the one-year drop in 2009, Colombia hadn't posted growth of less than 3% since 2002, making 2016's performance an eye-opening result for government officials and investors around the world.</p><h4>BUMPS IN THE ROAD</h4><p>How did one of Latin America's success stories post such a disappointing economic performance? The complex answer speaks to the interconnected nature of the modern globalized economy. As mentioned, Colombia's economic growth over the past decade was powered by a rise in oil production stemming from regulatory reforms passed in 2003. High global oil prices and a welcoming investment environment led to increased investment and a corresponding rise in production; between 2007 and 2015 oil production doubled to reach a new high of over one million barrels per day (bpd). But investment has fallen with the global decline in prices in recent years, and the sector has struggled as a result. Oil production dropped 12% to 885,000bpd in 2016 after some wells closed due to fiscal problems in the face of lower prices. The Colombian government has set a goal of 865,000bpd for 2017, but the sector faces fundamental issues that may make this difficult. Colombia's proven oil reserves have decreased significantly in recent years, and the lack of new investment means that exploration has slowed; no major oil reserves have been discovered since 1992. In 2014, Colombia's proven reserves were 2.3 billion barrels, but that number has dropped to 2 billion, according to some accounts. As a result, petroleum exports, which amounted to more than USD27 billion in 2013, fell to USD10.1 billion in 2016, a drop of more than 29% over the previous year. With such a drop in revenue, it is little surprise that the 20% of public funding that depended on petroleum revenues has evaporated.</p><p>While one of Latin America's more stable political situations, Colombia has also had to deal with its share of social unrest and the economic problems that have come with that. The long-running civil conflict between FARC rebels and the Colombian government often bubbled over and affected oil production; there are estimates that more than 4 million barrels were lost to attacks over the past 30 years. The logistical issues that come with the country's varied terrain and high levels of underdevelopment allowed rebel groups to disrupt production, affecting efficiency and investor confidence. The peace deal signed between the Colombian government and the FARC in late 2016 brought the primary conflict to an end, but wider regional problems still remain. Social unrest in Venezuela has led to political and economic tensions between the two countries. Colombia's second-largest export partner as recently as 2008, exports to Venezuela have dropped drastically, a reality that only begins to explain the economic damage the shattered relationship has wrought. Colombia's exports to Venezuela and its other Latin American neighbors tend to be value-added products, in contrast to its export to more developed markets like the EU and the US. The decreased volume of regional trade has brought down the Latin American economy, eroded investor confidence, and initiated a series of political issues that have led to difficulties as Colombia tries to manage the fallout from its next-door neighbor's instability.</p><h4>LOOKING AHEAD</h4><p>Yet despite all that, the Colombian economy is still positioned to remain a leader in Latin America. The government's considered response to the recent economic troubles have given participants confidence that Colombia's core fiscal and economic health remains strong and that the nation has better days coming soon. A few major programs look to play a crucial role in the upswing over the next few years. Colombia's government has launched an ambitious infrastructure plan that seeks to take advantage of the end of major conflicts to help develop previously overlooked areas. This should aid in the diversification of the economy away from oil, boosting revenues and producing more stable long-term revenue sources. The government has also recently implemented a major tax reform, which is expected to move more people to formal employment, hopefully boosting private consumption and developing a more mature economy.</p><h4>DIVERSIFICATION VIA INFRASTRUCTURE</h4><p>Launched in 2010, Colombia's Fourth Generation (4G) transport infrastructure plan is now in full swing. More than   USD24 billion in public-private partnerships and private investment are planned, with the majority of this going to road and bridge improvements. Transportation infrastructure has long been one of the main barriers to Colombia's economic growth; while industrial sectors have developed well in the nation's major cities, Colombia's transport infrastructure has lagged well behind. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index ranked Colombia's roads 120th in the world in 2016, well behind almost all its peers in Latin America. To change this, President Santos has announced plans to build over 7,040km of roads, 141km of tunnels, and 150km of bridges by 2020, with priority given to routes that link key logistical points and increase the ease of shipping overland. Work on the 4G plan is far from complete, as the loss of oil revenues has forced the government to find additional sources of financing, but participants are optimistic about the future of the project.</p><p>Improved transportation infrastructure is a stepping stone to the larger goal of a more diversified economy that takes advantage of Colombia's rich supply of natural and human resources to produce more value-added goods. Marí­a Claudia Lacouture, Minister of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism, identified six sectors with significant potential in a recent interview. “We designated six productive sectors as having strong potential: agro-industries, metalworking, industry 4.0, tourism, the fashion and textile industry, and chemicals,"" Lacouture told TBY. “[We are making] a huge effort to work with businessmen in each sector to increase productivity, innovation, and competitiveness.""</p><h4>FISCAL STABILITY</h4><p>Colombia also has the benefit of a well-regulated financial sector that has taken care to act in accordance with international standards. The fall in oil revenues brought inflationary pressures that threatened to balloon the fiscal deficit and threaten the financial stability of the country. The peso lost close to 80% of its value between 2014 and 2016, as inflation reached a 16-year high, but the Colombian central bank responded by aggressively raising the benchmark interest rate to 7.75% over a period of 11 months before dropping it to 7.5% by the end of 2016 as inflation slowed faster than anticipated. Early 2017 saw inflation continue to fall and the central bank responded by cutting the interest rate to 6.5% in April 2017. The central bank anticipates returning to its target inflation range of 2-4% by mid-2018. The aggressive interest rate actions reflect the central bank's belief that the fiscal health of the nation is assured and that energizing the economy by raising investment is the biggest challenge facing the nation at the present. Colombia's budget deficit issues should also be alleviated in the near future by the tax reform passed in late 2016. The reform raised the value-added tax, lowered the effective corporate income tax rate, and strengthened tax evasion penalties in an effort to recoup lost revenue from the fall in oil exports. While the effects are still waiting to be fully realized, economic leaders are largely optimistic that the reforms will decrease the burden on businesses to provide revenues and move more Colombians into the formal economy.</p><h4>PEACE IN OUR TIME</h4><p>Perhaps the single-most positive indicator for the future of the Colombian economy is the optimism that came with the landmark FARC peace deal. It is well understood that uncertainty is bad for markets and investor confidence, and with the long-running civil conflict over, new opportunities for economic growth should arise. Peace brings possibilities, ProColombia President Felipe Jaramillo Jaramillo told TBY. “In the context of a post-conflict era, we have been talking consistently about a bigger Colombia,"" he added. “We believe that many of the regions of the country that were falling behind in terms of development as a result of their proximity to the conflict are now open to the world, including foreign investment and international visitors."" All sides understand that it will not be a seamless process, but the solid foundation formed by a population willing to put in the needed work to grow and develop have given all good reason to be optimist about the future of the Colombian economy. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/4072da02-7f90-4665-8885-364336260fc2.jpg","","","","Falling oil prices have led to sluggish GDP growth, but good governmental leadership and a stable fiscal base is cause for belief that the country can return to form.","","","grand-colombia","1632","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After rising dramatically in recent years and becoming Latin America's best-performing currency by early 2014, the Colombian peso has faced declining fortunes in the past year. A combination of slowing domestic output and difficult global conditions combined to make it one of the most devalued currencies in the world over the past two years, at one point losing up to 70% of its value. The outlook for 2017 remains uneven, as market conditions stemming from the US' fiscal policy could continue to challenge the central bank's anti-inflationary policies.</p><p>The Colombian peso posted a strong performance after the global financial crisis of 2008. A more stable political landscape allowed the country to increase oil production, bringing new foreign investment, and strengthening the nation's financial position. Today, oil accounts for roughly half of Colombia's exports and one-fifth of all government revenue. However, such heavy reliance on a single commodity left the country vulnerable to external shocks. The fall in the price of oil beginning in 2014 had an outsize effect on the Colombian economy and thus its currency as well. With global overproduction cutting prices in half, Colombia developed a current account deficit that reached a high of 6.5% of GDP in 2015 before coming down below 6% to end-2016. Economic performance has lagged as a result, with GDP growth for 2016 projected at between 1.5% and 2%. With economic stagnation has come currency concerns, and Colombia's central bank has found itself in the unenviable position of trying to stimulate growth while preventing runaway inflation. Inflation hit 8.97% in July 2016, the highest level since October 2016, with consumer prices rising over 5% in the first eight months of the year thanks to a number of issues coming to a head, including a nationwide trucker strike and drought-like conditions due to a strong El Niño. In response, the Colombian Central Bank raised interest rates in July to 7.75%, the 11th straight month of rate increases. This rate, a 7-year high, was effective in bringing inflation down over the rest of the year; the inflation rate fell to 6.48% in October 2016 and 5.96% in November. While still above the central bank's target range of 2-4%, this progress encouraged domestic and global financial bodies that were concerned about the inflation rate.</p><p>Still, questions remain about the future of the Colombian peso. While some of the factors that led to 2016's high rates of inflation were temporary and unlikely to remain issues in 2017, global and domestic economic conditions continue not to be in the peso's favor. In mid-December 2016, the central bank lowered its interest rate to 7.5% due to concerns that economic growth was more persistently stagnant than expected due to low levels of investment. In addition, global economic shifts appear ready to challenge the Colombian economy in 2017. Oil prices have recovered in recent months, which should provide a much-needed boost, but slow global growth and a stronger dollar due to the US' new government create a difficult environment for the peso. The Colombian peso dropped in the wake of US elections as markets braced for changes in policy. Whatever the case, specifics are still unavailable, and investors expect volatility as a result.</p><p>Whatever happens, Colombia's core industries will be affected. The US accounted for USD10 billion in exports to and USD16 billion in imports in 2015, making it far and away Colombia's most valuable trade partner. Along with oil, Colombia's agricultural and mineral industries are vulnerable to currency shifts as a result of policy.

"2017-08-25T06:17:00.000Z","2017-08-25T06:17:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Hunt for Blue October","<p>On certain days, whether rainy or full of radiant sun, one is forced to stay home and get one's house in order before venturing out into the wider world. At certain historical junctures, the maxim seems to apply to nations as much as individuals: America in 1920, Britain in 1946, and China in 1958—however erroneously conceived at the time, each come to mind. Were this not the 21st century, 2016 would have unambiguously been that year for Colombia, a moment singlehandedly dedicated to domestic affairs in which the only foreign locale that mattered was Havana, the seat of the peace negotiations with the FARC.</p><p>Yet even in its most critical moment of domestic need, Colombia does not have the luxury of setting its diplomacy on the back burner. After all, the ongoing support and encouragement of the US, Cuba, and Norway was not just crucial to the legitimacy of the peace process; without the unwavering support of Uncle Sam, the deal has little chance of being enacted on the ground. And though peace must come from the hands, mouths, minds, and labor of everyday Colombians, it will be difficult to win without the support of international development agencies such as USAID, the UK Department of International Development (DFID), and the Norwegian People's Aid, which are collectively making the unofficial downpayment on the storied “peace dividend“ expected to start paying out in the decades to come.</p><p>The US, for example, has already allocated USD450 million to Paz Colombia, while the Norwegian People's Aid has dedicated USD22 million of a separate USD105 package solely aimed at demining efforts (to which the US contributed an additional USD36 million). Though this pales in comparison to the USD10 billion the US government shelled out on Plan Colombia, the anti-narcotics initiative that began under President Clinton but is now drastically ill-prepared to combat the surge in “post-peace“ coca-plant cultivation, it will still be critical to ensuring the minimum of job-training programs and other civil-society-bolstering methods are put into place in Colombia's most vulnerable regions as guerrillas attempt to trade in their arms for CVs and cable TV.</p><h4>Promises in Peril</h4><p>Comparative numbers notwithstanding, the relationship with Colombia's most critical partner, the US, still saw a preliminary scare in the early days of Donald Trump's presidency. In keeping with the campaign's promise of cuts to development spending across the board, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's confirmation hearings were a source of frenzied concern in early 2017. Refusing to promise that the US State Department would honor President Obama's fiduciary commitments to Colombia's peace before a congressional hearing, Tillerson sent shockwaves through the country. Only when Trump promised to “personally take charge“ of seeing that US funds would find their way south of Santa Marta did Colombians (and various foreign donors) breathe a sigh of relief. </p><p>Nonetheless, in late April Trump announced plans to cut economic aid to Colombia by 20%, from USD133 million to USD105 million for the fiscal year beginning in October 2017. At least, optimists argue, this was the least severe cut to any country in Latin America outside Haiti, in percentage terms. Does this mean Trump has a soft spot for the country? Unlikely. If one looks at how much the Obama presidency had budgeted for economic aid to Colombia for the same fiscal year, USD187 million, the purported USD105 million in Economic Support Fund aid would represent a much heftier 44% loss. Then again, given that Trump is proposing that aid to Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Paraguay be cut entirely, Colombia comes out looking considerably better in comparative terms.</p><p>Whatever the case, the total cost of the peace deal is much higher. Valued at USD44 billion over 10 years, it will take more than a few friendly tweet exchanges with POTUS to secure the funding needed to address and combat what most agree are the root causes of the conflict. While in theory—and for various conservative factions, in practice—ruinously expensive, this figure only represents only 11.6% of Colombia's total GDP in 2014 (USD378 billion), a figure that has admittedly taken a hit with the collapse in oil prices. But Colombia needs more than mere governments—it will also have to enlist the major economic organizations if it is to reach this vaunted figure.</p><p>Hence the Washington-based IMF's promise in 2016 to extend USD11.5 billion in loans to Colombia over the coming decade to offset the “cost of peace.“ Earmarked for major investments in agricultural programs, infrastructure projects, and various macroeconomic stabilization efforts, the loan was increased from an original soft promise of USD5.4 billion once it became clear that the government's fiscal balance had taken a turn for the worse since 2015. The EU has promised an additional USD80 million in grants toward the peace and another USD450 million in loans. </p><h4>The various Roads to Prosperity <br></h4><p>In addition to the peace deal and the fabled fiscal reform project, the goal of which is to offset the collapse in oil prices by increasing and rationalizing government revenues, the largest initiative of President Santos' government has been the massive 4G infrastructure initiative designed to overhaul the nation's notoriously poor network of roads. In merely a six-year period, 4G aims to construct nearly 5,500km of new motorways. According to Colombia's National Infrastructure Agency, the project is expected to boost GDP by 1.5% solely during construction and employ some 180,000 people.</p><p>What might otherwise have been a purely domestic affair when oil was at USD140/barrel now redounds upon Colombia's ability to dexterously negotiate diplomatic and financial arrangements with a variety of foreign powers. For starters, it is nearly impossible to do business without the Americans, though three of the top five banks financing 4G are Colombian—the single-largest lender is Goldman Sachs (USD1 billion) and the fourth largest is Japanese Sumitomo Mitsui (USD800 million). Given that the construction of these roads across a vast geographical network of mountain and jungle will be undertaken mostly as public-private partnerships with significant foreign backing, it will be imperative that the Santos government remain on excellent terms with the international community (which, if his Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 is anything to go by, will not be too much of an uphill struggle). Another crucial point in funding the 4G project was the 2016 sale of public utility Isagen to a Canadian firm for USD2 billion.</p><p>Somewhat ironically, one of the biggest criticisms of Trump's Latin America policy is the risk it runs in undermining one of the few US foreign policy triumphs in recent decades: a negotiated end to the Colombian civil war. Though Colombians deserve the vast share of credit for the deal, the point is that not only the prestige of the Santos government is on the line; so too is the US State Department's. Thus when it comes to projects like 4G, Colombia is right to strike while the iron is hot and get New York, Washington, Tokyo, London, and Geneva to contribute while the going is good. As has been stated many times over, the country's ability to emerge from the sullied and sodden path of a half-century of civil war will be contingent on the government's ability to connect Colombia's vast, disparate, and variegated terrain to the developed parts of the country—and to one another. </p><h4>Polka in the Pacific, but who's behind the Music?</h4><p>What of the view looking west? After all, one of the major footnotes to the 2016 presidential campaign and the ascendancy of Trump was the near-immediate scrapping of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Though Colombia was never a signatory, its failure will still reverberate there. For one, it spelled a major setback in the solidification of a Washington-led Pazifik Gemeinschaft. With Uncle Sam now taking a giant step back in the region, many now see an opening for Beijing. The great question of 2017, then, is the extent to which it will attempt to seize it. </p><p>For starters, what will Beijing do to boost ties with the Pacific Alliance, the powerful trade bloc comprised of Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Chile—a market some 217 million strong with an average GDP per capita of nearly USD16,000, half of Latin America's exports, and 35% of the entire region's GDP? Despite the bloc's strong exports, China's relationship with the Pacific Alliance pales in comparison to its imports from Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. Until the Chinese take to quinoa and corn tacos, it is the Atlantic rim of Latin America that will continue to dominate the Chinese appetite for commodities.</p><p>Yet the question is also one of politics. Though China is Colombia's second-largest trading partner after the US, it extended almost no credit to Colombia in recent years (in contrast to Venezuela, whose fledgling government it lent USD65 billion, or Brazil, which received USD21.8 billion, or even little neighboring Ecuador, some USD15.2 billion). Rather, China has almost exclusively focused its “debt diplomacy“ on countries with at best very lukewarm ties to America. After all, each of the biggest recipients of Chinese aid were also the centerpieces of the continental “pink tide“ at one point or another (Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina). The question, then, is less “why the others“ than “why not Colombia?“<br></p><p>The answer, of course, is Plan Colombia and the locus of drug and class wars that have politicized so much of Colombia's (Washington-leaning) foreign policy in the past five decades. Despite the disproportionate attention given to Colombia's struggle against the FARC (and ELN and M19), one must remember that it is still the only country in South America that didn't experience a single coup in the latter half of the 20th century. Apart from sheer “luck,“ much of this has to do with the close relationship the country enjoyed with the US throughout this same period. Arguably Washington's strongest Cold War ally on the continent outside of Pinochet's Chile, one must not forget that thousands of Colombians faithfully served in the Korean and Vietnamese wars. Thus, as the final “ideological straw“ keeping Beijing from doing real business with Bogotá now falls, 2017 will be a crucial year in determining the country's second-most important relationship, which, until this day, has remained shrouded in mystery. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/32748f53-333e-4e08-8817-d2d96034d196.jpg","","","","","","","the-hunt-for-blue-october","1384","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chosen by the Norwegian Nobel Committee since 1901, the prize recognizes individuals or organizations who have “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."" Previous winners include the UN, Doctors Without Borders, and human rights icons Martin Luther King Jr., Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela. In awarding the prize, the Nobel Committee noted Santos' “resolute efforts to bring [Colombia's] more than 50-year-long civil war to an end."" </p><p>Colombia being what it is, the prize was not quite as straightforward as it appeared; Santos accepted the award only five days after his government's attempt to ratify the agreement was narrowly defeated in an nation-wide referendum. Though a second peace deal was later ratified in both houses of the legislature, Santos' nomination and the differing domestic and international reactions to it demonstrate the difficulties of attaining peace and the complexities on all sides of Latin America's longest war</p><p>Colombia's armed conflict has its roots in the 10-year civil war that ran from 1948-1958 following the assassination of presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and sparked longstanding disputes between peasant communities and the government. In the 1960s, the Colombian military conducted anti-communist attacks in rural areas as part of the US' attempts to repress communism in the Americas. In response, militant left-wing groups coalesced into the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Other left-wing and paramilitary groups emerged throughout the lifespan of the conflict, but the FARC was the largest and most enduring organization.At its peak, it had an estimated 18,000 members, making it the largest insurgent group in the Americas.</p><p>The conflict produced an estimated 220,000 fatalities from 1958 to 2013, the majority of which were civilians. In addition, more than 5 million Colombians were displaced in the process. In the face of such widespread violence, harm, and suffering, the public desire for peace has long been widespread. Nonetheless, the size and influence of the FARC and the Colombian government's wavering acknowledgment of the left-wing group meant that earlier attempts went nowhere.</p><p>Santos was elected president in 2010 and announced two years later that his government had begun talks with FARC to end the conflict. After years of negotiations that saw continued military engagements broken by sporadic ceasefires, the government and FARC reached an agreement on a Special Jurisdiction for Peace in September 2016. This key agreement was the first step toward a negotiated peace deal, as it created a framework for FARC members to face justice in a way that both sides agreed on. On June 23, 2016, both parties signed the historic peace agreement in Havana, Cuba. After the agreement, FARC began the formal disarmament process by handing over its arms to the UN. The final agreement between the government and FARC called for the creation of a new political party to allow FARC to have formally recognized governmental representation in Colombia's parliament. Other key components of the agreement called for agrarian reform and rural land development.</p><p>International reaction to the peace accords was widely positive. However, reactions within Colombia were far more mixed. While many celebrated the peace process, many also thought the deal was too lenient toward the FARC. The lack of prison time for FARC members was a point of particular contention for conservative Colombians. The agreement was submitted for popular ratification in a nationwide referendum held on October 2, 2016. Over 13 million Colombians voted, with 50.2% voting against. Led by Santos' presidential predecessor, Alvaro Uribe, the “No"" campaign argued that the agreement was too lenient and linked it to larger socially controversial matters to draw in voters who opposed Santos' stances on other social issues.<br>Five days after this defeat, Santos' Nobel Peace prize served as a reminder of international support for the peace process. Spurred by the surprise loss, Colombians in favor of peace took to the streets in great numbers in nationwide protests calling for an end to the conflict. Building off this renewed momentum, the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised agreement on November 24, which was approved by congress, to bring the conflict to an official end. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Juan Manuel Santos' Nobel Prize demonstrated the international community's recognition of his efforts toward forging permanent peace with the FARC, but the process of ratifying the treaty reveals that the issue remains as complicated as ever for Colombians.","","Nobel Prize","eyes-on-the-prize-colombia-2017","1493","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Latin America & Caribbean > Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After 37 years in power, José Eduardo dos Santos, fighting with illness, will not run for the post. This means that after over 40 years of independence, and 15 years after the end of the civil war, the country will be electing its third president.€¨</p><p>Allegations of corruption, result tampering, and the use of public funds for the benefit of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the ruling party since independence, are likely to persist, but the fact that Eduardo dos Santos is not going to be in power anymore will likely be sufficient to make this an event to remember. It will probably not cure Angola of the profound economic crisis it is undergoing, including a decaying healthcare system, abject poverty, child mortality, and crumbling infrastructure, but it could bring a semblance of change.</p><p>And that is something the majority of the population has never known. Above all, it brings an important question into play; whether the dos Santos dynasty will endure or fade.</p><p>João Lourenço is largely thought to be on his way to becoming the next president. Picked by José Eduardo dos Santos himself, the MPLA member was Minister of Defense and a general. He runs against two main candidates. Isaí­as Samakuva, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) party, the great rival of the MPLA during the civil war and the historic force of opposition, is one. The other is Abel Chivukuvuku, former leader of UNITA and the founder of the Broad Convergence for the Salvation of Angola-Electoral Coalition (CASA-CE) in 2012.</p><p>There is a possibility that the two opposition parties may win enough votes to gather a majority in parliament, although, according to Angolan law, the party with most votes elects the president, even with a minority.€¨According to the largest poll carried out so far, the MPLA is leading with 60% of the votes.</p><p>That does not mean it will be an easy ride for João Lourenço. If he wins the presidency and secures a majority in parliament, there is a greater battle waiting for him, and her name is Isabel dos Santos, daughter of José Eduardo.</p><p>Throughout his years in power, José Eduardo dos Santos has skillfully protected his interests and those of his close entourage, including his children, allowing them to amass vast fortunes and gain control of both the sources of power and income within Angola. Few have benefitted as much as Isabel. She is today a certified billionaire, the richest woman in Africa, and with assets spreading across the world.</p><p>She is also the president of the board of directors of Sonangol, Angola's national oil company and lifeblood. Even in an era of depressed oil prices, Sonangol is still completely unrivalled as the most profitable asset in the country, and within the control of that asset lies true power. The successive presidents of Sonangol have always been lowbrow loyalists, submissive to the designs and decisions of president dos Santos, but now that has changed. Even with her father as president, Isabel has shown herself to be a much louder and more imposing voice than any of her predecessors, especially as she embarked on the financial restructuring of the company, which recently presented less-than-exciting results for 2016.</p><p>While as the president of Sonangol she had a multiplying effect on the father's power, which will most likely shift with the change in governance. The same will happen with Filomeno dos Santos, the son that José Eduardo dos Santos put in charge of the Angolan Sovereign Fund. Last month, the chief of the president's civil house sent a letter to all heads of state-owned companies to prepare a transition file, implying that they could be stripped of their positions at the request of the new president.</p><p>José Eduardo swiftly revoked that letter, establishing they would serve their mandates until the end in a display of power that largely humiliated his subordinate but also served to show that he had no intention of leaving his offspring unattended in the future.</p><p>This is the battle any new president will have to fight; a battle for the control of the sources of wealth in the country, and it will not prove easy. If the new president does not fight the dos Santos positions, he will find himself severely weakened in government. If he tries to gain control over them, he will find severe resistance, at a time when Sonangol is in dire need of stability and profound financial restructuring. There will be change in Angolan power, but the months ahead are hardly clear, and it is uncertain what Angolans stand to gain.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/2eb5326d-00f4-47b0-b221-9b8e2973b65d.jpg","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/headerImages/5b6b802c-5c29-4c21-9a2d-7687a551955b.jpg","","Angola voted in what was arguably the most important political event since its independence.","","ANGOLA HEADS TO THE POLLS","angola-2017-vote-results","1999","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Europe & CIS > Portugal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-16T07:03:00.000Z","2017-08-16T07:03:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Loopy heights","<p>After a visit to Dubai, Silicon Valley's Hyperloop One is one step closer to building a transportation system that can transport goods and passengers at speeds of up to 760mph (1,223kph) using vacuum and magnet technology. If the construction goes ahead, it would mean a 10-minute journey between Dubai and Fujairah, and another 11 minutes to get from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, with neighboring Riyadh a short 45 minutes away.</p><p>In November 2016, Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) signed an agreement with Hyperloop One to do a feasibility study for the project. The decision was part of a carry-over from the Dubai Future Accelerators program and aims to leverage new technologies in schemes and products that will benefit society. Hyperloop One's CEO, Rob Lloyd, believes that the vacuum-sealed pod transportation system can cost as much as 62% less than high-speed rail systems, and from a technological point of view could be built within the next five years.<br>Dubai has adopted the old adage that “if you want to find out the benefits of technology, invest, develop, and implement.“ With that notion, DP World has put up a USD50 million loan to bring a prototype online and explore the possibilities of utilizing the technology for cargo transport to a dry dock. This will see Hyperloop One's total funding hit USD160 million, and see DP World's Chairman &amp; CEO, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, sit on the board for Hyperloop One.</p><p>The brainchild of Elon Musk, the Hyperloop technology works by magnetically suspending a capsule and running it through de-pressurized tubes. Removing the amount of air resistance on the capsule allows it to reach Mach speed. The design has been taken on by America's UCLA, which has grappled with the idea of developing stations and designing the pod's interior, as well as integrating new terminals and systems into densely populated cities. Speaking early in 2016 at the World Government Summit in Dubai, ex-Hyperloop One CTO Brogan Bambrogan stated that the possibilities for theHyperloop are endless and that both transnational and international opportunities are being explored.</p><p>There are many concerns about the safety of travelling at such high speeds, and the proposed solution has been to remove the space for human error. Two other aspects allow the designers to create near-absolute safety; the fact that the pods run on an entirely closed system removes the need to cater for changing weather conditions, and the first-of-its-kind design also allows designers to create a totally safe transport environment, rather than adapting an existing system. This will be manifest in Hyperloop One's Proof of Operations Facility, which would see the company create a stripped-down version of the Hyperloop along an intended track, allowing local regulators to work with designers to ensure safety requirements before going fully operational. The company says the system offers better safety than passenger jets, lower build and maintenance costs than high-speed trains, and energy usage per person that is similar to a bicycle. Musk is not directly involved in the project, either through finance or management, in either of the two companies that are responsible for developing the system, with Hyperloop Transport Technologies (HTT) also developing systems. That said, Musk and SpaceX remain interested in developing the technology, and in January 2017, will run an open competition for pod design. Hyperloop One is looking at designs in which autonomous pods will be called by passengers to carry them to the terminal and seamlessly connect into the larger capsule that will transport the passengers and cargo to a final destination. November's announcement means that DP World Group is joining French national rail company SNCF, US industrial conglomerate General Electric, and Russian state fund RDIF as backers, and it looks like the Emirate will be the first to benefit from this new means of transportation, keeping the region at the forefront of transport technology and innovation. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hyperloop","loopy-heights","1315","552ef2b0361618126878404e","554c8ef286b7b0082093bb9f","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-16T03:45:00.000Z","2017-08-16T03:45:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Fast & Furious","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/c4014262-d82e-4427-a635-7302bddb8988.jpg","Fast & Furious","","","","","<p>The sheer pace and scope of Dubai's development has made it a global exemplar of how to build an urban and commercial environment capable of meeting the rigorous demands of tomorrow. Massive state spending, in tandem with private sector initiative and know-how, has provided the infrastructural foundation of the Emirate's trading prowess and transport matrix. And in the new climate of low oil prices, Dubai is cashing in on its diversified economy, in which the transport, logistics, and storage sector remains an engine of GDP growth, accounting for around 15% of the Emirate's GDP in 2015.</p><h4>On the Right Road</h4><p>Economic diversification in itself has notable consequences that demand an equally diversified transport system. A notable one is the decentralization of key activity centers, chiefly Bur Dubai and Deira. And as the population grows, demand for land has resulted in additional developments that need logistical connections of their own. In Dubai, the car has been king; yet, given the growing population, the government has been keen to fly in the face of habit by promoting greener solutions. Sector data indicates that in Dubai, around 700 new vehicles are registered daily, making one in two people an owner. Indeed, by 2020, Dubai's population of over 5 million will be making four times the current five million daily car journeys. The prospective congestion doesn't bear thinking about, and initiatives are underway to mitigate it. It emerged in February that 200 autonomous electric Teslas would join the ranks of Dubai's taxi and limousine fleet in 2017. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) plans for half of the taxi fleet to comprise green vehicles by 2021. This runs in parallel with plans to transform Dubai into the world's smartest mobility city by 2020. The Dubai Smart Autonomous Mobility Strategy intends for 25% of total journeys to ultimately be made in autonomous vehicles. In 2016, new carbon emission targets stipulated electric or hybrid vehicles comprising 10% of new vehicles over the next four years. Accordingly, carbon emissions are likely to slide 16% by 2021 as all public vehicle fleets go green. The RTA, tasked by the Ministry of Transport to oversee Dubai's highway network, is investing USD12 billion in 500km of intelligent roads by 2020, easing flow and curbing accident rates. As of February 19, the RTA had separated the link between the Salik toll gates at Al Safa and Al Barsha. The move expedites traffic flow on main roads for public and commercial vehicles alike, as the Shaikh Zayed Road (SZR) remains an express traffic corridor, while mass transit systems, too, are less encumbered by congestion. This is significant as, apart from the 52km Dubai Metro Red Line, 156 public buses on 12 routes make 1,400 daily journeys per day to serve the SZR.</p><h4>Public Transport</h4><p>Despite the abovementioned passenger car numbers, a welcome change in public mindset is in evidence. In 2016, public transportation usage in Dubai—including metro, trams, buses, marine transit, and taxis—as a percentage of total public mobility rose impressively from a 2006 low of 6% to 16%, thus close to London's 19%. The government wants a ratio of 20% by 2020, approaching the 25% of Berlin. Dubai Metro, launched in 2009 and featuring five lines, was the second such network in the Arab world beyond Cairo. By 2025, the 69-station network will span 221km. Passengers using public transport in 2016 climbed above 543.6 million YoY from 539.5 million, by RTA figures. The average daily passenger print was roughly 1.5 million. The Dubai Metro claimed the lion's share of commuters at 35%, followed by taxis (33%), and public buses (28%). The Dubai Tram saw a better YoY print of 5.4 million passengers (4.07 million), as did buses, with 151.1 million passengers (134.775 million).</p><h4>The Logic behind Logistics</h4><p>The growth of transportation and logistics reflects state initiatives that serve economic diversification beyond hydrocarbons to sectors including trade, export, import, and tourism. This has seen the meteoric rise of a complex system of seaports, airports—benefitting greatly from prevailing open skies policies—and related warehousing facilities at dedicated commercial hubs such as the Jebel Ali Free Zone. Such hubs enable diversified manufacturers located there to meet demand from local consumers and export markets alike.<br>Exemplifying aforementioned diversification is the delivery of world-class healthcare as part of Dubai's burgeoning tourism industry. Hellman Worldwide Logistics, the market leaders in regional healthcare logistics, expanded its facility located at Dubai World Central (DWC) in 4Q2016, whereby, ""It is probably the single-largest healthcare warehouse in the region, with 25,000 pallet positions.""</p><p>And by way of contextualizing Dubai's current transportation status, the GCC overall has around 40 ports, 35 of which are of consequence, together handling close to 70% of total MENA container port traffic. Meanwhile, 43 airports today operate within the GCC. In volume terms, the global transport and logistics industry is set to reach 92.1 billion tons by 2024. Furthermore, the global third party logistics (3PL) market is set to expand at a CAGR of over 5% by 2020. Key factors are globalization and improved international economic conditions, while more locally, ongoing increased liberalization and industrial diversification fueled by a drive for increased local content may be cited. Moreover, industries keen to rationalize business practices are increasingly focused on core activities. In consequence, the range of verticals to be catered to by the logistics industry in Dubai keeps the market competitive. Girish Kumar Nair, the Managing Director of Dubai-based Elite Airborne told TBY that, ""The advantage of being in Dubai is that, ""The Emirate is a well-positioned bridge between East and West, right in the middle of the world (whereby) most of Dubai's growth has been due to the leveraging on its geographical location."" This advantage yields access to a regional population base exceeding 2 billion people set to rank among the world's busiest trade areas by 2030. Add to this the fact that 60% of all the Middle East's imports pass through Dubai. A well-oiled machine, Dubai's transportation matrix features Al Maktoum International Airport, located conveniently close to Jebel Ali, the world's third-busiest logistics and shipping hub. The opening of DWC has tangibly expanded the potential. The master plan, rolled out back in 2001, in 15 stages guarantees Jebel Ali's evolution through 2030. Meanwhile, the world's sole integrated logistics free zone, Dubai Logistics City (DLC), is set to process an annual 12 million tons of cargo by 2020.</p><h4>On the High Seas</h4><p>Port Rashid and Jebel Ali Port respectively began operations in 1972 and 1979, but were strategically merged in 1991 to establish one of the major port operators in the GCC. Jebel Ali is also the world's largest man-made harbor and globally the most productive facility according to the Journal of Commerce, and can berth the world's largest vessels. Its more than 90 weekly services span over 140 ports worldwide, and the latest expansions envisage total handling capacity of 22.1 million containers by 2018. Intermodal connectivity is the order of the day, where digital platforms remove paper records from the operation of sea, land, air, and rail services relied on by the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza) that 7,300 international companies call home.</p><h4>Huge in the Air...</h4><p>The Dubai brand has been carried the world over by flag-carrier Emirates, established in 1985, and today responsible for around 60% of all flights landing in Dubai. Its fleet of 251 aircraft provides close to 2,000 weekly passenger flights, connecting the Emirate to 101 destinations on six continents. And while the aviation sector reportedly already accounts for 25% of GDP, the official target is a massive 32% by 2020. Emirates boasts the greatest number of A380 super-jets anywhere, and relocation to Al Maktoum International Airport seems set to prompt a doubling of its fleet size. By 2020, Emirates plans single-handedly to carry today's entire volume of international travelers to Dubai, numbering 70 million passengers. Dubai's growth trajectory has meant that the construction of strategic facilities is never done by halves. Accordingly, in 2014, the tri-terminal Dubai International Airport (DXB) leap-frogged London's Heathrow, becoming the world's busiest airport with 70.47 million passengers processed in 2015. As well as being the world's sixth-busiest by cargo volume, Terminal 3 is also the world's biggest single building by floor area, at 1.7 million sqm.<br></p><p>In June 2015, Dubai Airports announced a total renovation of Terminal 1, and a USD7.8 billion expansion of Terminal 2 by 2020. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/cc7ae461-1277-4388-a5de-50609420f2de.jpg","","","","Dubai's vast transport and logistics industry, supported by economic diversification, benefits from multimodal transportation, while green technologies counter future congestion.","","","fast-furious-uae-dubai-2017","1783","552ef2b0361618126878404e","554c8ef286b7b0082093bb9f","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-15T13:06:00.000Z","2017-08-15T13:06:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Top Tee","<p>Deloitte's commissioned report on Dubai's sports sector has highlighted the growing importance of golf tourism in bringing international exposure to the Emirate's world-class facilities as well as outlining the revenue the sport will bring to local coffers. </p><p>The Economic Impact of Sport in Dubai study, published by Deloitte, has calculated that sport's direct economic impact is valued at USD131 million annually, with a total impact of USD670 million, and an economic footprint of over USD1.7 billion a year.</p><p>Golf's contribution to these impressive figures comes from the 80 events held across 11 facilities and courses. Golf's direct economic impact is USD131 million, a whole 30% of sports total economic impact. An aggregate of over 1 million people attend golfing occasions every year. The most attractive of these are the internationally renowned DP World Tour Championship and the Omega Dubai Desert Classic. The report, which was commissioned by the Dubai Sport Council and Falcon, shows that the gross expenditure on golf in Dubai amounts to USD270 million.</p><p>Dubai has a strong appetite for golf and its surrounding events, with the 11 golf courses equating to a population per course ratio of 200,000 per course, compared to popular golfing destinations such as France and Spain, which have one course per every 112,000 and 134,000, respectively. There are a further four courses under construction which would bring Dubai's ratio to 143,000 per course. Dubai's 6,000 golfers equate to a participation rate of 0.26%, about a third of the European average of 0.73%. The nine golf courses currently operational generate annual revenue of USD120 million, of which USD109 million comes from local residents. With the anticipated growth in population, these numbers show room for growth within the sector, potentially in the field of cheaper, more affordable courses.</p><p>HE Saeed Mohammed Hareb, Secretary General of Dubai Sports Council, explained to TBY: “Golf is huge in Dubai, and we have world-class facilities here in the UAE. People seek to come here just to play golf in the UAE. The number of world-class greens here is huge for the size of the population.“ The 80 events which the Emirate holds, including the DP World Tour Championship, which includes world-class players, including previous winners Rory McIllroy, Martin Kaymer, and Henrik Stenson. The championship is the last installment of the European Tour's Race to Dubai, a series that travels 26 countries and includes tournaments in neighbouring Abu Dhabi. Hosting the finale brings prestige and media attention, as it is where Europe's number one player is crowned after accruing points over the 47 tournaments.</p><p>Dubai's growing prestige over the past decades has established the Emirate as a key player in the international golf landscape. Hosting leading events at its world-class facilities has brought not only golfing superstars, but amateur golfers hoping to walk the same greens as their heroes. In a 2013 KPMG study, Dubai tied for 6th (alongside Abu Dhabi) as the most popular golf tourism destination, only edged by seasoned European destinations (Scotland, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland) and Turkey. Deloitte's more recent study estimated the golf tourism sector to be worth USD38 million in Dubai. Golf is a sport that tends to be played by the wealthier classes and so returns an impressive spending break down; the 16,000 international golf visitors per year typically stay five nights in Dubai, spending USD410 per day on accommodation and additional expenditure, average flights cost USD1,350, of which an estimated 27% are with Emirates airline. The volume of these visits will certainly increase with the continuing Airbus and Boeing orders from Emirates, coupled with the ever-growing airport traffic and high tourism projection of 20 million tourists by 2020.</p><p>As well as providing an estimated 1,800 people with jobs, the sport also supports employmentin numerous ancillary industries in the supply chain. As it stands, around 440,000 rounds of golf are played in Dubai every year. With the current investments coming to fruition, that figure is only expected to rise in the years to come. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Golf tourism","a-top-tee","1629","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5992f96486b7b01a30e04016","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once a quiet fishing village, a concerted full-spectrum investment effort has turned Dubai into one of the most popular tourism destinations in the world. As a result, the number of incoming tourists has risen from under half a million in 1990 to more than 14 million in 2016, making Dubai the fourth most-visited city in the world after London, Paris, and Bangkok. Firmly established as one of the city's core industries, government and industry leaders are working to form new relationships, open new markets, and ensure that Dubai remains one of the world's tourism capitals for decades to come.</p><h4>BY THE NUMBERS<br></h4><p>The number of people flocking to see Dubai exploded in the mid-1990s and has continued to grow at a steady rate over the past few years. 2016's 14.9 million overnight visitors was a new record, up 5% over 2015 and 8% since 2012—twice the rate of the global travel industry as a whole. Metrics of travel, spending, and duration were all up significantly, which speaks to the strength of the sector even an uncertain global climate. Growth was everywhere, even in the face of economic setbacks. Arrivals from the UK rose by 5% following Brexit and a resulting currency devaluation. Similarly, India's currency crisis didn't keep it from repeating as the single most popular source of foreign visitors; 1.8 million Indian citizens arrived as tourists, a rise of 12% over 2015. Dubai also saw remarkable growth from Chinese and Russian visitors, with inbound tourism rising by 20% and 14%, respectively for the two countries. Additional strong growth from US and Western European travelers more than offset decreases in arrivals from Africa (7%) and Australia (9%).</p><p>More precise measures of the tourism industry's health are reflected in the sector's strong performance. Dubai's stock of hotel rooms rose by 5% in 2016 to cross the 100,000-room mark. This recent growth comes due to a full-spectrum approach designed to make the Emirate a destination across all sectors of the industry. While 2016 saw the opening of more of the luxury hotels Dubai has become known for, three-star hotel room capacity grew by 24% and four-star by 8%, a positive sign for the diversification of the sector. With an average stay length of 3.6 nights, the number of occupied room nights per hotel rose from 26.4 million in 2015 to 28 million in 2016. Revenue per available room dropped from USD119 to USD108, due to the increase in non-luxury accommodation, but the overall rise in travelers meant that the industry saw increased performance nonetheless.</p><p>One of the strongest elements of Dubai's tourism industry is the fact that its visitors spend more than any other city in the world. A 2016 Savills report found that international overnight visitors spent an average of USD2,050 per trip to Dubai, almost twice the average of the 12 global cities surveyed. In sum, this accounts for USD4.7 billion in food and beverage spending and USD9.70 billion in retail spending. Dubai's relatively small permanent population has given it the highest visitor per resident ratio in the world, with 5.7 visitors per permanent resident in 2015. As a result, tourism accounts for approximately 20% of Dubai's GDPD, one of the highest rates in the world. Research by the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council estimated the sector's contribution to the UAE economy at USD64 billion and estimated that this could double within the next decade.</p><h4>FUTURE PLANS</h4><p>Tourism has become one of Dubai's economic pillars, but industry and government officials have no plans to rest on their laurels. Several initiatives are underway that aim to introduce new markets for tourism, generating new offerings and ensuring that the Emirate remains a top destination for travelers from all walks of life. In 2012, the Dubai government launched a Tourism Vision 2020 plan, which set a number of ambitious goals, including increasing the number of annual visitors to 20 million per year and tripling the tourism sector's economic impact. The plan has three core objectives: maintaining existing market share in Dubai's current largest source markets, increasing awareness of Dubai's offerings in order to expand into new markets, and increasing the number of repeat visits.</p><p>To do so, Dubai is working to extend its offerings across family, event, and business sectors and build a tourism infrastructure that offers something for everyone 52 weeks  of the year. The aforementioned increase in three- and four-star hotels is a key first step toward increasing budget family travel, and the city has recently introduced several new family attractions. IMG Worlds of Adventure, which opened in August 2016, is Dubai's first themed amusement park and, at more than 1.5 million sqft, the largest indoor theme park in the world. 2016 also saw the opening of Dubai Parks and Resorts, a 25 million sqft theme and water park complex that is the largest in the region. Other new attractions recently brought online are the Dubai Opera, the Ethiad Museum, and CITY WALK, a retail shopping complex. Jasper Hope, CEO of the Dubai Opera, recognizes that the Emirate's high volume of tourism gives its Opera house an unique character. “While our main target audience is simply the people who live and work in Dubai, regardless of whether they are Emirati or Egyptian or British, we do, of course, realize that a large part of our visitors will be traveling business people as well as tourists,"" Hope told TBY. “Together, this multicultural crowd is working toward the same goal, which is to make Dubai an amazing global destination in all aspects, and this is reflected in the wide-ranging cultural offering that we have at the Dubai Opera. We have had a full house practically every night since opening, which just shows the appetite for diverse cultural offerings in Dubai.""</p><h4>EXPO 2020<br></h4><p>Elsewhere, Dubai's MICE sector has made strides in recent years and recently signed agreements to host a number of major conferences. The city was named the Overseas Luxury MICE Destination of the Year 2016 at the China Travel &amp; Meetings Industry Awards and was also recognized as one of the Middle East' Leading Meetings &amp; Conference Destinations at the World Travel Awards Middle East. Already the leader when it comes to MICE travel in the region—Dubai is responsible for over one-quarter of all MICE industry in the Middle East—the Emirate is well positioned to use its central location and well-established infrastructure to remain a global leader in the sector. In 2013, Dubai won the right to host Expo 2020, beating Izmir, Yekaterinburg, and Sao Paulo to become the first MENA country to host the exhibition. The Expo is expected to bring more than 25 million visitors from 180 countries and serve as a major source of economic growth in the city, with one IMF estimate predicting growth of more than 5% due to new construction. Dubai's Expo 2020 administrative team has announced that it will award more than USD3 billion in construction projects as it seeks to complete the majority of the required construction more than a year ahead of the event. This will in theory allow the country to fully integrate new construction into its tourism infrastructure, the better to smoothly accept one of the world's largest gatherings. Once completed, this new construction is expected have a long post-Expo lifespan as host facilities for numerous future MICE events. </p><h4>NEW MARKETS<br></h4><p>Firmly established as a premier travel destination in some of the biggest markets in the world, Dubai is working to spread awareness of its offerings and increase its standing as a destination in underserved ares. Today, 40% of Dubai's tourism comes from the GCC, India, the UK, and Germany, but the city's Vision 2020 calls for a renewed effort to tap the potential of China, Africa, and Latin America—three enormous and rapidly growing markets with few current ties to Dubai tourism. In late 2016, Dubai partnered with key Chinese and financial services to increase connections between the two countries, introducing a Chinese-language duty-free website and increasing the presence of key Chinese credit card providers in Dubai markets. With just 450,000 Chinese visitors in 2015, Dubai tourism officials claim that forming connections with China's rapidly-growing middle class is one of its top priorities. To this end, it has worked to increase hotel and retain options for Chinese consumers. Early returns have been positive, and industry officials are optimistic that they can continue to build on 2016's 20% increase in Chinese tourism. Similar efforts are underway in Africa, which saw several heads of state visit the Emirates within the past year. In an effort to make travel easier, Emirates airline recently debuted new flights to several major sub-Saharan African cities. Here, growth has been slower, but the size of the market—an estimated 11.7 million people are expected to move to the middle class by 2030 in Nigeria alone—means that continued engagement is a wise investment in the future health of the sector.<br>All the while, Dubai continues to make moves and broaden its platforms to become a vital and vibrant destination across all sectors. Its new Medical Tourism Destination project, launched in 2016, plans to build 18 new hospitals to support the city's medical tourism sector, which has been growing by 40% annually over the past few years. It is developing new golf courses to augment its sports tourism offerings, with the aim of expanding what is already a USD135 million industry. Well aware of the need for continuing growth and ability to adapt to consumer demands, Dubai's tourism sector looks primed to remain a global landmark for years to come.</p><h4>THINGS TO SEE</h4><p>While the Emirate is hard at work creating new tourist attractions, it is also remarketing historic sites in an effort to energize tourists. The Bur Dubai, considered one of the Emirate's oldest sites, is home to historic buildings, villages, markets, and the original Arabic wind-tower houses, built by wealthy merchants. It is also home to the Dubai Museum, which is built in part of the Al Fahidi Fort, the oldest building in the city, constructed in 1787 as the premises of the monarch and a fort for defense, sitting on the border of urban Dubai at the time. Later, the fort was turned into an arsenal. It was also used as a prison for the outlaws. The fort was renovated during the reign of the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum and opened as a museum in 1971 to showcase the Emirate's heritage. The museum recreates traditional Arab homes, markets, mosques, and even date farms. At the textile souk, also in Bur Dubai, visitors can walk through reels upon reels of silk, embroidery, and cotton, or take a look at the impressive architecture. From Bur Dubai's souks and museums, guests can venture to Deria by crossing the Dubai Creek, the historic focal point of the city, on a traditional abra water taxi. While tourists can find gold and spice souks, dhows, and the renowned fish market in Deria, this side of the creek is home to many modern business, entertainment venues, and malls.</p><p>The Emirate is also boosting its adventure tourism offerings. Skydive Dubai takes visitors through a 26,000sqm drop zone, providing perhaps the best vantage point of sights such as the Burj Khalifa, the Burj Al Arab, and the Palm Jumeria.

"2017-08-15T11:20:00.000Z","2017-08-15T11:20:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Our house,  in the middle -income street","<p>With the growing population, a maturating of the market, and perhaps an over served-premium segment, there has been a blurring of lines of the black and white split between Dubai's luxury and middle-income renters. The Emirate still has a lot of spending power; its middle-income segment consists of those earning USD5,440 per month, or families earning USD54,439 per annum. Products and payment schemes are being developed for those earning USD2,722 per month and below, but until now the majority of the activity is among higher earners. The high level of competition and the years of penny pinching following drops in oil prices has meant that developers and tenants alike are looking outside of the premium segment. CBRE's managing director, Nick Maclean, told TBY; “Tenants are prepared to move for better value accommodation, which is being made manifest in the migration of tenants to the outskirts of the city. Consequently, rents will continue to decline until we get a level of integration that matches the supply of new stock coming into the market over the next few years.“</p><p>Dubai's landlords still enjoy good returns on their investment, with the market having sustained double-digit growth for several years, and tenants have grown weary of landlords sitting back and collecting their annual 10% rent increase. The risk of a price bubble has been mitigated by the introduction of the Regulatory Real Estate Authority (RERA). The Dubai government was keen to avoid a repeat of housing price bubble that hammered the economy over 2008-09. This was partly achieved through issuing Decree No.43: Determining Rent Increases for Real Property in the Emirate of Dubai, whereby landlords were given caps on the annual rent measured against the average unit price for similar units across Dubai.</p><p>The tenant has essentially won a price war; they have shown the developers and agents that they are willing to move out of the more lucrative areas in search of better value. Dubai Marina registered a 12% decrease in rental yields over 2016, as did Nakheel's Palm Jumeirah, proof that tenants had looked for other options before deciding to pay USD16,332 annually per bedroom. </p><p>The drive to cater for the middle-income market could also be the government and developer's rebuttal to the 1 million commuters who come into the city each day, many of whom enjoy 40% cheaper rates in the neighboring Emirate of Sharjah. This is echoed by the 3-5% rise in rents across areas outside of the city such as International City, Silicon Oasis, Discovery Gardens, and Dubai Sports City. These areas outside the city saw growth, despite rents broadly falling across Dubai.</p><p>The changing price dynamic could also be a mirroring of the wider economic ambitions of the government.  The Emirate's leadership have been trying to encourage entrepreneurs as generators of innovation. As well as offering new visa categories, there is a wider move to build studios, or one-bed apartments, to attract entrepreneurs who do not have large accommodation needs. MAG Group has been particularly active in this space, and is one of several developers that have looked at the middle-income segment as a key driver for growing their business. The group's Meydan project will consist of: 40% studios; 30% one bedroom, 20% two bedrooms; and 10% townhouses. With prices not exceeding USD122,500 to 136,100 for studios; USD176,900 to 190,500 for one-beds; USD258,600 to 272,200 for two-beds, and townhouses from USD408,300 to 517,200. From premium developer Sobha, Meydan is situated a few kilometers further from the city, whose Heartland development has four-bed luxury villas starting at a staggering USD4.1 million.</p><p>The middle income, or affordable segment, has been the amalgamation of various forces both organic and reactionary, but perhaps it has added balance to the market as the tenant has more choice, while the developer has a new market to tap. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","our-house-in-the-middle--income-street","9271","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Just over halfway through 2017, we are starting to see the pragmatic outcomes of the efforts of a country still officially in Phase II of implementation and a private sector worried about its competitive edge when becoming fully compliant with AEoI and moving toward a worldwide trend of transparency.</p><p>On April 21, 2017, the UAE signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Convention), a multinational instrument for international tax cooperation aimed at taxation transparency and combatting money laundering and other illicit flows of liquidity. The convention details various forms of administrative assistance in tax matters, including exchange of information on request, spontaneous exchange, automatic exchange, tax examinations abroad, simultaneous tax examinations, and assistance in tax collection. The UAE joins Kuwait and Lebanon in signing the Convention in 2017. However, the UAE has not signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement, which works in conjunction with the Convention, though it committed to signing it at an earlier date. With proposed first exchanges set to occur in 2018, the regulatory system of the UAE is set for some potentially drastic changes when it comes to taxes and banking and company secrecy over the next few months if compliance occurs on schedule. At the time of writing, the UAE still has not deposited any instrument of ratification or approval with the OECD, so it is difficult to say whether exchanges will happen in 2018 or not.</p><p>The OECD touts the Convention as a simpler and more standardized way to get to automatic global information exchanges without each country having to negotiate a bilateral agreement with every other country. However, not every country has been willing to jump on board with the OECD's mission, typically citing conflicts with preexisting national law, banking secrecy, concerns for beneficial owners, and so on. The UAE has taken numerous steps over the past 20 years to bring international disclosure standards to corporate governance and taxation in the UAE, like requiring companies to operate in compliance with International Accounting Standards. OECD compliance is simply the next step in the UAE continuing down this path and ensuring that more sustainable and genuinely profitable companies choose to make the UAE their home.</p><p>Financial institutions in the UAE were already reporting information on bank accounts held by tax residents of the US and certain entities controlled by such tax residents on account of signing a Model 1 intergovernmental agreement with the US, instigating FATCA in 2015. Fully applying the Convention means those reporting requirements will expand to every country that has signed the Convention. However, the Convention only has reporting requirements rather than the broader requirements within FATCA to actually withhold certain taxes, so although the reporting requirements are broader due to the increased number of jurisdictions involved, the numerated obligations are fewer for financial institutions. </p><p>Prior to the Convention, exchanging financial information on residents was typically an on-request procedure, leaving the decision to release information as a sovereign matter. Under the Convention, that information is automatically exchanged at the end of a fiscal year, absent a few exceptions meaning persons with tax residencies differing from their physical residences will typically have any tax information shared with both countries of residence. Some of those persons will need to reevaluate where assets are located and in what amounts in order to ensure they are not unnecessarily doubling their tax burden. </p><p>Fortunately for those in this situation, historically whenever a country joined the Convention or some similar automatic exchange, they typically set up a period of time for a process called voluntary disclosure. Voluntary disclosure means that non-compliant persons can inform the government of the taxes they haven't paid and pay them with little to no penalty. It decreases the cost of noncompliance for a taxpayer and encourages transparency with the tax resident country so the country of residence can properly track what amounts it should be receiving taxes on and all countries involved can help stem the flow of illicit funds through otherwise opaque systems. While countries have yet to specifically list the requirements for disclosing information about amounts in the UAE, it would be logical to expect that with the large amount of assets in the UAE, others will create or extend current voluntary disclosure options to encourage citizens and residents to comply.<br>These new reporting requirements will be in addition to any controlled foreign company (CFC) rules that may apply to any given person. With taxes in the UAE so low compared to most other jurisdictions, the UAE is regularly labeled as a tax haven or blacklisted, a condition that typically sets off CFC rules in other jurisdictions. CFC rules are aimed at preventing the erosion of the domestic tax base and discouraging residents from shifting income to low or no tax jurisdictions like the UAE. While these rules vary from country to country, generally they look at whether a domestic taxpayer controls the CFC, if the jurisdiction the CFC is located in imposes a tax rate substantially lower than the rate in the shareholder's country or if the CFC is located in a grey or black listed country. We can expect to see income earned in the UAE and received by those outside to be subject to much higher reporting requirements as the UAE exchanges more information and the recipient jurisdictions become more aware of how much they are not collecting. This will likely result in the amounts being taxed in both countries until the UAE is no longer blacklisted or the countries renegotiate tax treaties to remove this exception to double taxation treaties.</p><p>With such a complex network of ever expanding signatories to the OECD's agreements, new and limited voluntary disclosure periods, and developing CFC rules, companies and individuals whose assets are spread across borders will need to avail themselves of every opportunity to become knowledgeable about the compliance landscape and to comply with their tax liabilities in all countries that may have a claim to their income. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.eptalex.com/offices/dubai-uae""></a></p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/e459b5b0-ea22-4593-9c25-ac106f7cd3cc.png","","","","Eptalex — MEG LEGAL SERVICES looks at the latest developments in the UAE regulatory landscape.","","","the-uae-signed-a-multilateral-convention-under-the-oecd-now-what","2339","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The UAE was recognized for improving one-stop shop procedures for doing business, including streamlining processes for construction permits and registering property. And within the UAE, Dubai has been the most successful at attracting investment. In 2016, FDI amounted to USD6.9 billion, maintaining Dubai's ranking in seventh place among the top-10 global recipients. The Emirate furthermore attracted 247 new investment projects, ranking third behind London and Singapore for the year, according to the Dubai Investment Development Agency (Dubai FDI).</p><h4>New Laws and Regulations </h4><p>Change is on the horizon in Dubai as the Emirate looks to implement VAT and introduce new bankruptcy regulations. The new laws and regulations will clarify how things will work and hopefully increase confidence for investors in the long term. However, in the short term, the changing tax landscape and regulatory reform may have somewhat unpredictable cost increase effects on doing business.</p><p>The bankruptcy law provides a framework to allow Dubai to continuing performing as a major regional trading hub, including mechanisms for enforcing debt payments while still protecting businesses against creditors and increasing cooperation during restructuring processes. The insolvency law, officially Law No. 9 of 2016 on Bankruptcy, was published in the Official Gazette September 29, 2016 and came into effect in December 2016.<br>Dubai, and the UAE as a whole, will implement VAT in coordination with other GCC states, and the VAT will be introduced on January 1, 2018. According to information from the Ministry of Finance, the rate will be low and is likely to be at 5%. All businesses in the UAE will need to record their financial transactions and ensure that their financial records are accurate and up to date. Businesses that meet the minimum annual turnover requirement, as evidenced by their financial records, will be required to register for VAT. One extremely important advantage of VAT on the economy is the improvement of transparency and need for businesses to have well-kept accounts. The VAT will replace the custom duty.</p><p>As the VAT applies across the UAE, the Ministry of Finance is overseeing the implementation of the VAT, and businesses will able to register for VAT online.</p><h4>Free Trade Zones (FTZs)</h4><p>Despite the introduction of VAT, there are 27 FTZs, which allow companies to remain 100% foreign owned and operate with complete exemption from all import and export duties in Dubai. FTZ registration allows companies to open a foreign bank account and places no restrictions on the number or range of business activities. The only condition is that of a local partner that can underwrite the business and provide administrative support.</p><p>Jebel Ali Free Zone hosts more than 7,000 companies, including more than 150 of the Global Fortune 500 companies. Dubai Airport Free Zone is one of the region's fasting growing FTZs, and lists more than 1,600 companies. FTZs continue to be the backbone of Dubai's economy, stimulating diversification and FDI. The growing number of FTZs indicates the free trade opportunities and industries are expanding as the overall economy continues to diversify and new industries emerge.</p><h4>Special Economic Zones</h4><p>In addition to FTZs, Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are hot beds for SMEs, providing many of the same benefits as FTZs without being defined by a specific sector. Dubai's SEZs include Dubai International Financial Centre, Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), and Dubai Industrial City. In 2016, DMCC was named the Global Free Zone of the Year by the Financial Times' fDi magazine, based on criteria such as outstanding YoY performance, growth and expansion plans, strong customer offering, and presence of high growth industries. DMCC hosts more than 12,700 member companies with more than 87,500 workers. It is a government entity established to position Dubai as the preferred destination for global commodities trade.

"2017-08-15T11:03:00.000Z","2017-08-15T11:03:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","New Horizons","<p>Dubai's multifaceted educational system reflects the city's global nature. Arab, British, Indian, and American educational traditions are just a few of those represented thanks to the Emirate's growth and development bringing in citizens of those regions. As Dubai seeks to diversify its economy, increasing knowledge-based skills is one of its top priorities. To this end, government officials have worked to increase connections with foreign universities, opening up satellite campuses and establishing research partnerships to increase the transfer of skills.</p><h4>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY</h4><p>Dubai's primary and secondary education system is free and compulsory for all citizens from age five through 15. Public education is conducted primarily in Arabic, with strong emphasis on English as a second language. Dubai has a well-established private school network, with classes offered in a wide scale of international curriculums. American, British, and Indian are the most popular among private schools, but Dubai's global community has allowed it to support French, Canadian, IB, Iranian, Japanese, and Russian private schools, among others. Dubai's private schools are overseen by the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), which was created in 2006. As of the release of 2016 report from the Dubai School Inspections Bureau (DSIB), the KHDA's inspection arm, Dubai had 173 private schools that educated some 265,000 enrollees, or approximately 90% of all students. Over 240,000 of these students were international, a marker of the city's globalization and international population.</p><p>Balancing the different educational needs and demands of such a wide-ranging population has its challenges, and improving the quality of its primary and secondary schools through standardized testing and application of leadership best practices is one of Dubai's top priorities. As measured by the DSIB, the system has made significant gains in recent years; its 2016 report found that 61% of students attend schools that provide a “good or better"" quality of education, as measured on their inspection scale. This is a marked increase from 2008-2009, which found that only 30% of students were in this category of schools. Even as recently as 2014, just 53% of students could be found in schools that made this cut. </p><p>One challenge facing the Dubai school system is that its schools are not evenly distributed by curriculum; the proportion of Outstanding-to-Good schools with UK, IB, Indian, and French curriculums is much higher than in US or Ministry of Education schools. This gap, in large part a reflection of the demographics of international workers from these countries, is one of the Dubai government's top priorities. To improve US curriculum schools, for example, KHDA has partnered with the New England Association of Schools and Colleges to align standards and assessment policies and begin the process of obtaining accreditation by this body. With over 48,000 students—including 20,000 Emirati—in these US curriculum schools, meeting high standards will have significant positive effects as the Emirate looks to create a more skilled population. Another point of emphasis has been to improve educational outcomes for students with special needs and disabilities (SEND). A 2006 UAE Law guaranteed SEND students the right to educational accommodations, and the Emirates have spent more than USD2.4 million in the years since ensuring that schools are outfitted with the support systems needed. Within the past three years, Dubai schools have doubled the rate at which they identify students with SEND and have made key strides in developing new curricula and finding qualified teachers.</p><p>Overall though, Dubai's educational system is trending upward. Standardized test performance has been rising sharply across all educational areas, and self-reported leadership and student support assessments have reported growth even as the rigor and expectations of the schools has risen. Dubai will be piloting a new Emirates Standardized Test in spring 2017 in an effort to measure readiness and skill acquisition throughout the years. Administered in grades one, four, six, eight, and 10, the EmSAT will help the Emirates better understand how they measure up to international standards and become a new admissions test for public post-secondary schools in the UAE. </p><h4>HIGHER EDUCATION</h4><p>Heavy investments increased the options available for post-secondary education in Dubai, but the system is still working to find a balance for success in the modern world. The influx of foreign investment has brought a new wave of universities to the Emirates, allowing talented students to attain a good education without leaving the country, a major step for creating a strong and sustainable economy. However, there is a clear split between public and private schools; public universities are free but usually lower quality, while private schools offer the opportunity to interact with top global institutions but are some of the priciest in the world. Despite the high prices, the private sector has been thriving in recent years, with international students and Emiratis alike drawn to the world-class educational quality at these institutions. The Dubai government has been happy to welcome private foreign entrants, passing a law in 2012 that gave degrees from licensed foreign operators the same status as public degrees, removing a major barrier to acceptance by Emirati citizens. Today, more than 60% of all Emirati citizens are at private universities.</p><p>Private universities started arriving in Dubai in the 1990s and now constitute the majority of the market. Fully aware of the potential of the sector and the need to create areas of close interaction between universities, Dubai's government has created free zones where private and foreign schools cluster, creating zones conductive to collaboration and research. The most important such centers is the Dubai International Academic City (DIAC), which, with more than 24,000 students from 145 nationalities studying in its 25 international schools, is one of the largest educational centers in the world. Mohammed Abdullah, DIAC's Managing Director, sees DIAC as an important host for educational infrastructure in the region. “We have specific infrastructure that caters to the requirements of academic institutions [including] robust connectivity with their main campuses,"" Abdullah told TBY. “For example, Amity University came to Academic City in 2013 and immediately set up shop on one floor of a pre-built learning space, which was followed by an expansion the next year into a second floor and in 2016 it launched its brand new campus, which it built. Infrastructure has been put in place to help these universities be proactive and grow.""</p><p>The next steps for Dubai's university system is to solidify its position in the country, and improve research capabilities in order to develop a knowledge-based economy. To do so, several universities are working to expand their physical presence in the Emirate, moving from DIAC to larger and complex university complexes. Amity University's growth and development is a representative example; the Indian-based school has become the first foreign institution accredited to award law degrees approved by the indian Bar Council. Other institutions making key advancements abroad include the University of Manchester's Dubai Business School, which has become one of the most successful professional programs in the region since its arrival in 2006. Director Randa Bessiso views the program's public-private partnerships and global connections as emblematic of the new kind of education needed in Dubai. “Business education is key to developing knowledge economies,"" Bessiso told TBY. “Public-private partnerships have a huge impact on business, and we have invested a lot of effort in bringing in partners to help develop business ideas into tangible projects… Ultimately, we are helping to provide the academic framework to stimulate and promote innovation within the Emirates with an ecosystem to foster innovative business ideas.""

The Dubai Water Canal is the latest project to shape and control the nature of Dubai for the pleasure of its sailing enthusiasts and as a new means of transport that can alleviate congestion and spur further economic growth.</p><p>This massive project extends the Deira Creek by 2.9km, connecting the Arabian Gulf to Dubai's Business Bay. This environmentally friendly project is composed of three different zones: the Public Realm, the Green Network, and the Water Network. The project cost an estimated AED2.7 billion (USD735 million) and has a width of between 80 and 120m. In total, it measures 3.2km from the Arabian Gulf to the JW Marriott marquis and has a depth of about six meters with the capacity to carry 1.8cbm of water.</p><p>The Water Network is composed of three water bodies including the Canal, the Arabian Gulf coastline, and the Crystal Lagoon located in Safa Park. The coast area provides the city with a breathtaking beach front, and the lagoon gives the residents the coastal experience they previously lacked, lending access to water and the beach. Alternatively, the Green Network connects the new Jumeirah Beach Park to the Safa Park giving the residents an overwhelming leisure experience.</p><p>Other than the breathtakingly scenic features of the canal, there is also a 5km network that will be filled with outlets, retail shops, and restaurants along the boardwalk. In fact, the whole project has been estimated to offer new areas in the city measuring about 80,000sqm that will offer space for various public facilities, a new trade center, and private marinas.</p><p>The canal is expected to bring many economic advantages to the city. It is set to have significant positive effects on tourism, as it will feature various attractions including floating restaurants and cruises. Furthermore, it will also add to the city's economic growth by sparking real estate growth and business, not to mention the transport possibilities of four new marine transport stations.</p><p>The first phase of the project's development included the construction of a bridge with eight lanes, costing an estimated AED580 million (USD158 million). The bridge was to be constructed on Sheikh Zayed Road to allow the course of the canal to flow under the road.</p><p>The second phase involved the construction of bridges on Jumeirah Beach Road and Al Wasl Road. This phase was also key because it prepared a pathway for yachts and other marine crafts up to 8.5m high to pass under the roads and through the canal. The phase also included an interchange with multiple tiers to connect the movement of traffic between Al Hadiqa, Al Wasl, and Al Athar roads.</p><p>The last phase is the largest and the most expensive part of the project, costing about AED802 million (USD218 million) for the digging of the Water Canal and the construction of the excavated channel. This final stage of the project also involved the construction of four marine transit stations, three bridges for pedestrians, and a human-made peninsula through Jumeirah Park. Several running tracks, sitting areas, and green spaces will overlook the water.</p><p>A ceremony was held in November 2016 to open the canal for use, and most of the work on the canal was complete at the time. Sheikh Zayed Road bridge was complete and operational, both the Jumeirah Beach and Al Wasl Road bridges were complete as well, and the pedestrian bridges along the canal were almost done.<br>This titanic project was the result of 4,650 workers laying 150,000 tons of cement and 25,000 tons of reinforcement steel for a total of 20 million hours of labor.</p><p>Dubai is the ultimate expert on colossal projects; the water canal is only the most recent of many to come. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dubai Water Canal","making-waves-on-dubais-coastlines","3342","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537aa8186b7b412f8a46323","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ernst &amp; Young reported that the UAE topped the list in 1H2016, having the lion's share of the USD19.7 billion worth of M&amp;A transactions in the MENA region. The headlines have been dominated by super-mergers in the capital, but slightly subdued from the front pages has been the solid M&amp;A activity among healthcare service providers. </p><p>The healthcare consolidation has not been born out of necessity, as the anticipated growth of 12.1% CAGR through 2020 shows the healthcare sector is not struggling. Instead, the trend has been a consequence of the trajectory toward a point of saturation within the sector. The UAE hosts around 100 hospitals and 2,000 healthcare centers and clinics, with an estimated 101,797 beds for the population of 10 million. Even when considering the UAE's young population, both expat and national, this is a lopsided figure. This is compounded by a reported oversupply in the market for the top end, and undersupply at the bottom end. Only 35% of the market caters towards middle and high-income earners, but many of these private clinics and hospitals provide their services solely for this segment, and are not able to operate at the lower margins for blue collar populations who still require healthcare services.</p><p>Another factor is the increasingly regulated environment in which healthcare providers operate. New regulation means that laboratories have to fall under ISO accreditation, a requirement that, as well as ensuring safety standards, also drives up costs and makes it less attractive for smaller hospitals and clinics to run their own testing facilities. These costs are inescapable, because even if labs decide not to apply for accreditation, they must now outsource their testing to an accredited lab. The law is being enforced strictly, with Dubai Health Authority's drive for better quality translating into a higher volume and frequency of inspections. Consequently, the smaller players targeting those looking for affordable rather than luxury-level healthcare are no longer meeting the universal standards and are starting to fall away.</p><p>This issue is compounded by the mandatory health insurance law, which compels all companies to insure all of their employees, who are in turn able to access higher-quality healthcare than they would have been if paying out of their own pockets. This facet has in itself been affected by regulation, as only nine insurance companies are licensed to provide blue-collar insurance for those on less than AED4,000 a month. This has left over 35 insurers in the lurch, roughly 60% of the market, but removes the fragmentation of the market and thus price competition. The nine licensed insurers can create a fair market with good prices, ultimately translating to good quality. The insurance regulation has also brought in co-payments and cut down the number of visits, so while the population is growing, the lower volume of visits again hurts those smaller operators.<br>The big deal that sparked life into the M&amp;A space within the sector was the acquisition of Abu Dhabi's Al Noor Hospitals by South Africa's Mediclinic; a deal valued at USD2.12 billion. This saw Al Noor reverse-listed on the LSE as a result of the takeover. NMC were reportedly interested in moving in on the deal, but Mediclinic's CEO David Hadley told TBY that the intent was never serious from the Abu Dhabi health giant. Other activity has included Avivo Group's USD90 million acquisitions of Kalium as part of its AED1.1 billion backing for inorganic growth.</p><p>Looking ahead, as smaller players are forced out of the market, more assets will be put on the bidding table. Unlike previous years of double-digit growth and clinics opening in every neighbourhood, 2017's healthcare headlines will reflect attempts to come to grips with the rising cost of operations. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/417772d6-9a9b-44a6-ba0f-d242bdc44920.png","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/headerImages/c5de81bf-c8dd-4f93-afb2-37111af2c679.png","","The consistent stream of investment into healthcare has not necessarily been a boon for provision, and the fragmentation of the sector has created a market ripe for consolidation, which experts anticipate to continue through to 2018.","","Healthcare M&As","service-provider-mas","1398","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-15T09:57:00.000Z","2017-08-15T09:57:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Room of One's Own","<p>If the strength of a city's real estate sector were measured by the height of its buildings, Dubai would be the envy of the world. Home to over 900 completed high-rises, the wave of development that began in the 1990s has transformed the city's skyline and brought it to the forefront of the global architectural scene. Skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa, (the tallest manmade structure in the world) and Marina 101 (the tallest residential building in the world) are just a few of the iconic buildings that have made the city's skyline the tallest in the world. Yet the wider real estate sector is not without its challenges. Global economic uncertainty has led to a slowdown over the past two years, with declining property prices dating back to 2016. A host of economic causes have combined to generate an increasingly fragmented market, but industry and government officials remain confident in the long-term health of the sector.</p><p>The general sentiment when looking at the data for the Dubai real estate market in 2016 was that the city has moved past the worst of the economic slowdown. Real estate research firm JLL noted that Dubai's GDP grew at a rate of 1.8% from 2015 to 2016, well below the heights of its recent boom but a better performance than Abu Dhabi, which saw its GDP decline by 4.2%. This comes from Dubai's diversified economy and position as a central figure in the MENA tourism and finance industries, which have allowed it to weather drops in the price of oil better than surrounding Emirates.</p><h4>RESIDENTIAL<br></h4><p>According to JLL, 14,600 residential units came onto the Dubai residential market in 2016, the largest influx since 2012, which saw 16,000 new units. This speaks to the glut of supply on the market, which has fueled falling rental prices. Residential property prices declined overall in 2016, but at a slower rate than in 2015. Phidar Advisory's Dubai House Price Index reported that prices for apartments, which account for 90% of all residential real estate transactions in Dubai, fell 6.8% YoY in 2016. Significantly, lower-priced apartments performed better than the luxury market; low-and medium range properties actually saw prices rise by 15% and 2.8% in 4Q2016, while standard apartment prices declined by 1.3% in the same timeframe. Rizwan Sajan, Chairman of DANUBE Group, told TBY that the growth in this sector was due to the industry recognizing the new opportunity for growth. “People are focusing more on the mid-range segments,"" Sajan told TBY. “Everybody has realized that there is a huge vacuum and big market that can be capitalized on. Previously the market focused on huge towers and apartments worth AED2,000 per square foot, with an average apartment cost around AED4 million, but now people are focusing on apartments worth AED1 million or less.""<br>The swelling supply combined with the fallout from low oil prices led Standard &amp; Poor's to predict that residential prices in Dubai would continue to fall through 2017 for a third straight year. Another key influence on housing prices is the fall in the UK pound; according to the the Dubai Land Department, UK nationals are the fourth-largest investors in Dubai real estate, and the drop in the pound since the UK voted to leave the EU is expected to slow a key source of investment in the sector. Still, opinions on the housing market are not uniformly negative. The financial strength of the sector remains strong, with S&amp;P reporting that it does not expect to lower any ratings on UAE companies over the coming year. And there is some belief that housing prices will start to rise again in 2017 due to increased infrastructure spending and a rise in economic activity during the run up to Expo 2020. Going forward, the low- and medium-range sector looks to be an essential part of the continued development of the sector, providing a base of steady growth while luxury apartments recover from the economic slowdown that has beset the region. </p><h4>RETAIL</h4><p>Dubai added 260,000sqm of retail space in 2016, the largest total since 2010. The bulk of this came from the completion of The Avenue in City Walk and an expansion to Dubai Festival City, the Middle East's largest mixed-use development. As with the residential sector, the retail market is projected to add a significant amount of space over the next few years; JLL projects that over 700,000sqm of new retail space will come on the market through 2017, an expansion that raises similar oversupply concerns as in the housing market. Still, average retail rents remained stable in primary malls in 2016, with rents in secondary malls actually rising 9% over 2015 in 4Q2016. Vacancies increased slightly, rising from 8% in 4Q2015 to 9% in the same time frame in 2016, though industry analysts do not expect any significant changes in the sector's performance in 2017. The possible oversupply of space remains a cause for concern, but Dubai's status as a global shopping center has kept confidence high.</p><h4>OFFICE SPACE</h4><p>As with retail, Dubai's office rents remained fairly stable throughout the year in the face of slightly weaker demand. Over 120,000sqm came to market, and continued development in 2017 is expected to boost the available supply by 300,000sqm. This new development represents a shift of sorts to new areas of the city and away from the Central Business District that has traditionally been the epicenter of the city's office space. While rents remained steady, industry analysts expect rents to fall slightly in 2017 due to the downward pressure from the influx of office space. Sector-wide, the office real estate sector has been marked by a new emphasis on smaller units, and several sites have seen a consolidation of available space. This likely comes from a combination of downsizing due to the slowdown and a new adjustment to the structure and of modern companies, and developers have been quick to adapt by offering smaller subdivisions. The strategy has been successful thus far, as the sector saw vacancies fall throughout 2016 to 15% in Q32016, down from 22% in the same period in 2015. However, this is expected to rise slightly in 2017 due to the influx of new office space expected to hit the market.</p><h4>SECTOR REFORMS</h4><p>Dubai's government has implemented new regulatory measures in recent years intended to reduce volatility and reckless investment. In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the government founded the Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), which all development and brokerage companies were required to register with. RERA has set limits on allowable maximum property rent increases and required that all projects have a monitored escrow account, which helps international investors limit their risk. More recently, Dubai's Land Department raised transfer fees for property transactions from 2% to 4%, an action designed to prevent speculative transactions and “flipping."" While still below the rates for France (6%), Japan (5.8%), and the UK (up to 15%), this move brings Dubai's fees closer to regions with more developed real estate sectors and should help prevent the overly speculative moves that can led to damaging bubbles and collapses in the sector. Other recent regulations designed to calm the market include limits on the amount buyers can mortgage and borrow. The establishment of the Al Etihad Credit Bureau in 2012 was designed to give both lenders and borrowers more complete information, preventing the ill-advised decisions that, en masse, can create a housing crisis. Industry participants are by and large supportive of the government's recent regulatory measures. Vijay Doshi, Managing Director of Vincitore, believes that the current structure is conducive to stability. “[Investors] feel very safe,"" Doshi told TBY. “[RERA's] regulations have built a lot of confidence in investors from all over the world; they know that their money is safe and in escrow."" Still, Doshi and other industry participants expressed a desire for more clarity in some regards. Rizwan Sajan, for example, expressed a desire to see the mortgage cap lowered but acknowledged that the DANUBE group understood the reasons for the current structure. “I would prefer if the mortgage cap of 50% was reduced to 25%, as that would allow the market to be more bullish,"" he said. “But at the same time, the government is trying to protect the market in the event of a downfall.""</p><h4>NEW GROWTH POTENTIAL</h4><p>Going forward, the future of the real estate sector looks likely to center around two key trends: affordable housing and Expo 2020. The need for more non-luxury housing options to support the city's rapidly expanding middle class is recognized by many participants as one of the sector's most important trends, with significant repercussions for the future of Dubai. While Dubai's luxury skyscrapers have become iconic symbols of the city, developing the real estate infrastructure needed to support a stable middle class will be essential for the city's sustained economic and cultural well-being. Rahail Aslam, CEO of Select Group, told TBY that the sector has been somewhat overlooked in the past, but is entering a new era. “[The sector] has been extremely underserved in the past since developers focused on big margins and high-income developments,"" he told TBY. “In any city or country, the middle class is usually the biggest segment, and Dubai is no exception. The middle class has been developing and growing… A lot of developers are now producing or building mid-income housing and we are no different."" </p><p>“Real estate goes in cycles,"" Kleindienst Chairman Josef Kleindienst told TBY, a sentiment shared by just about everyone involved in the sector. Participants know that fortunes ebb and flow as global economic trends and regional circumstances shift, a long-term perspective that has the sector well positioned to succeed in the long run. The buildup to Expo 2020 is expected to be the event that will spur a new wave of real estate growth and bring the Dubai economy out of its momentary slowdown. For Expo 2020, Dubai announced in January that it would award more than USD3 billion in construction projects in 2017 in an effort to finish most of the construction more than a year in advance. As the Expo draws closer, the surge in jobs, visitors, and economic activity is expected to produce a new rise in residential and retail prices. Confident in the long-term health of the sector due to the city's diversified position, industry participants are eager to begin a new cycle of success. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Dubai's real estate sector has slowed in recent years due to regional and global economic circumstances, but new growth in the affordable housing sector and the city's well-diversified economy have kept it in an enviable position.","","Real Estate","a-room-of-ones-own","1360","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As of August 2016, Uber was available in 66 countries and 545 cities worldwide. </p><p>Careem utilizes a similar model, and is another app-based car booking service, based in Dubai. The app is available in 11 countries and over 40 cities in the MENESA region. The two have signed agreements with Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that will see Dubai's 14,000 taxis and limousines being listed on these platforms.</p><p>Dubai's home-grown competitor to Uber, Careem, signed its agreement with the RTA three months earlier, in October 2016. Having started operations in Dubai back in 2012, the company now has a fleet of 90,000 drivers and 4 million users across the region.</p><p>Both applications' appeal to users is that they offer a more secure taxi service at the same price as a usual taxi. However, one disruption to that expectation came in early 2017, when Careem announced that each Dubai-originating trip would carry a AED3 surcharge due to “new fees and regulations.“ Similarly, Uber's prices stand around 30% higher than the traditional taxi services due to the regulation imposed on them.</p><p>Across the world, taxi drivers have fought back against being undercut on prices through cost-saving products such as Uber-Pool. In Abu Dhabi, the regulator TransAD blocked ride-sharing apps toward the end of 2016 due to a host of issues, such as the legality of the drivers working for the company, over-charging of customers, and not following the law. This had been a problem in other cities such as San Antonio, Berlin, and Rio de Janeiro, with the primary issues revolving around uninsured and unlicensed drivers and the safety of the vehicles being used to ferry passengers. </p><p>That being said, both Uber and Careem are unlikely to slow in their growth. Uber's number of regional riders grew 500% between 1Q2015-1Q2016, with driver growth going up 400% in the same period. Both companies see opportunities within the market and are securing the financing to pursue it. Uber received USD3.5 billion in investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Careem finalized USD500 million in funding in December 2016, with Saudi Telecom Co. taking a 10% stake as part of the deal.</p><p>The two's respective deals with the RTA have also included the capacity for pod transport and driverless cars. Although futuristic sounding, this is part of Dubai's Autonomous Transport Strategy, which aims for 25% smart and driverless transportation in Dubai by 2030. Careem, for example, has promised to deliver a prototype of the driverless pods by 4Q2017, and has already teemed up with the US start-up Next Future Transportation to bring advanced transport technologies and practices to the region. </p><p>In the meantime, if commuters do not want to rely on being taxied by Uber and Careem, the RTA has teamed up with companies U Drive and ekar, each of which is providing 100 vehicles that will be able to rent through the RTA for AED24-30 per hour.

This is a familiar narrative that can similarly be pinned to Emirates and Etihad's rise to prominence. DP World's trajectory has probably seen fewer headlines, given the nature of the less-glamorous ports and container business, but the company sits pretty, rated number three in the top-five port operators in the world, handling 9% of global volume. With substantial and strategic investments being made in port infrastructure in fast-growing markets, DP World looks set for further growth.</p><p>Looking eastward, the UAE hopes to make the markets of China and India its two largest trading partners. With movement of goods into the giant economies, it makes sound business sense for DP World to facilitate, and subsequently cash in on, that through its own ports and the duties on those goods. Between the two countries, DP World has 10 ports, with China accounting for three, and India the remainder. China's Cosco Shipping Ports have just returned the favor to neighboring Abu Dhabi and will invest USD400 million in building a new container terminal at Abu Dhabi's Khalifa Port, which will add 2.4 million TEU capacity, roughly doubling the overall capacity. The Chinese presence is already significant in the UAE, with 200,000 workers and Dubai International Financial Centre playing host to China's four biggest banks. </p><p>The importance of developing Chinese relations are even more salient given the re-ignition of the old Silk Road, through the One Belt, One Road strategy. This strategy, if tapped correctly, can yield market access to Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. Within South Asia, DP World already operates Mohammed bin Qasim port in Karachi, where it faces local competition from Hutchinson's Karachi Port, the largest port in the country. Karachi is the largest and most populous city in Pakistan, home to 10 million residents, making it the second-largest city in the Muslim world. Karachi's ports account for 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade. DP World's positioning, in both China and Pakistan, is expected to be fortified by the development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which has been earmarked for USD46 billion of investment as part of the Silk Road plan. Both China and the UAE are investing heavily in the market, and in the previous fiscal year, the UAE was second only to China in terms of FDI to Pakistan, with a total of USD111 million. </p><p>Looking southward, DP World is making shrewd investments in sub-Saharan Africa, building ports in strategic countries to gain further access to landlocked markets in the interior. The best example is DP World's exploits into Somaliland following Djibouti's cancellation of its port concession with Dubai after a corruption case. Both moves were a bid to gain access to the growing trade with Ethiopia, which lost direct access to the sea after Eritrea's successful bid for independence. The 30-year concession with Somaliland, with an automatic 10-year extension, has cost up to USD442 million for the company, but has developed a market place of at least 100 million people, in an area of the continent that is seeing impressive and consistently high annual GDP growth.<br>In Latin America, the UAE's influence is substantial. For example, Peru's largest port is operated by DP World, the country's largest energy plant is 36% owned by one of Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth funds, and the largest food companies are owned by Abraaj Holding, a Dubai-based family business. Since 2010, Peru has received USD1.7 billion in investments from the UAE.</p><p>DP World, in just two decades, has grown from a start-up to a globally positioned company with a market capitalization of almost USD15 billion. All over the world, in a symbiotic relationship, investment in the nation's maritime infrastructure offers a corridor for growth and development that benefits both parties. Despite uncertain market conditions, DP World's impressive growth figures are representative of a robustness that has come with the operator's focus on high growth markets. The government-controlled company stands on track to expand its capacity to a 2020 target of 100 million TEU per annum to benefit many markets beyond the UAE's borders. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The familiar strategy of strong centralized leadership coupled with envious capital reserves and an aggressive acquisition strategy has lead DP World to global recognition within two decades. Today, the company's global positioning can be used as a tool for developing infrastructure in high-growth markets for larger benefits of UAE investment and trade.","","Global Reach of DP World","a-whole-new-world","1471","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537aa8186b7b412f8a46323","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The maritime sector generates AED26.9 billion annually for Dubai's economy, totalling 7% of GDP. A deeper look at the number also reflects the growing strength of the industry; the sector generates 76,000 jobs over more than 5,500 companies involved in 13,000 activities. The sector grew 25% from 2011 to 2015.</p><p>The success of Dubai in this regard was confirmed in a 2017 report from Menon Economics of the leading maritime capitals of the world. The report benchmarks maritime cities based on shipping, finance and law, technology, ports and logistics, and an overall evaluation of attractiveness and competitiveness. Dubai especially exceeded in the latter category, placing fifth behind only Hamburg, Copenhagen, Oslo, and Singapore. One of the most attractive aspects of Dubai in this respect is its policy framework, including taxes, subsidies, and regulations, with “50% of the experts in Dubai regard(ing) the policy framework (as) highly attractive,"" the report states. Dubai was also ranked alongside Hamburg, London, and Copenhagen in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship based on the opinions of a host of experts, a fact that is unsurprising considering the efforts of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, who is keen for Dubai to remain on the cutting edge of disruptive technology. All together, the maritime industry is hastening Dubai's transformation into one of the world's most important business centers.</p><h4>Regulation</h4><p>Any sector of global reach and fundamental economic significance can only flourish in a solid and internationally relevant regulatory environment. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is a United Nations agency promoting the adoption of a global regulatory shipping regime for maritime safety and security, as well as navigational efficiency and pollution control. As Secretary-General Kitack Lim explained, “The world is no longer prepared to accept services or industries that are simply cost-effective. We now demand them to be safe, green, and clean, as well as efficient."" To better leverage the Emirate's geostrategic advantage in the shipping sector, the Dubai Maritime City Authority (DMCA) was established in 2007 to foster best international practices. The DMCA is instrumental it many ways, including the promotion of the sector internationally. In late 2016, the DMCA organized the Middle East's first comprehensive maritime event in Dubai, during which the DMCA also hosted the Maritime Leaders Summit, a meeting of top-level minds from the international maritime community. DMCA is also gearing up for the return of Dubai Maritime Agenda in October 2017. Building on the success of the inaugural Agenda in 2015, the second Dubai Maritime Agenda event will include a wide program of conferences examining the global outlook for the shipping industry, maritime arbitration, innovation in shipping technology, finance and the role of shipping banks, and maritime clustering, and is expected to attract high-profile guests from around the region and beyond.<br>Training…<br>The Dubai Maritime Sector Strategy (MSS) aims to transform Dubai into a global maritime training and education hub. A century in the business, Maersk is all but a synonym for shipping. Regional Managing Director of Maersk Training, Vijay Rangachari, explained in a TBY interview the firm's training focus on the maritime, oil and gas, and crane industries. “Stakeholders like DMCA are critical in helping the industry have the right dialog around raising the standards for safer and more efficient operations."" He tellingly recounted how, “The industry in the region loses tens of millions of dollars annually due to downtime incidents, which can be easily avoided by addressing the underlying issues around competency and people skills.""</p><h4>…And Arbitration</h4><p>Emirates Maritime Arbitration Centre (EMAC) opened in November 2016. Its outward objective is to provide an alternative to time-consuming and costly litigation in an industry dependent on turnaround times. The global nature of the shipping business means companies prefer confidential arbitration, reportedly on average taking between six and 24 months to resolution, to lengthy procedures based on local legal systems. Dispute resolution processes executed by EMAC conform to the rules operative at the Dubai International Finance Center (DIFC), where EMAC is based, and conform to English Common Law. New legislation also brings an end to parallel actions in court. Yet EMAC's wider remit is to promote the local maritime sector internationally through a membership network comprising sector players and to relay their wishes and concerns to the government. EMAC may sign an MoU with the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) for wider cooperation; international reach narrows the geographic gap for arbitration processes. The organization has also bid for Dubai to host the International Congress of Maritime Arbitrators in 2019 or 2020.</p><h4>A True Behemoth - Jebel Ali</h4><p>The total number of vessels utilizing Dubai's ports in 2016 came in at 21,868, according to data from the Dubai Statistics Center. Standing out, the mighty Jebel Ali port complex, which underpins the entire industry, handled 14.766,519 TEUs in 2016, according to the Dubai Statistics Center. Of note, the comprehensive nature of the Emirate's shipping sector is exemplified by the “other"" category in official Dubai Statistics Center shipping data, accounting for close to 14,714 vessels in 2016. These vessels are predominantly smaller break bulk cargo ships stemming from as remotely as South Asia and East Africa, and which are at the heart of Dubai's lucrative re-exporting and free zone activities.</p><p>Modest beginnings as an overflow facility for the port of Mina Rashid in the 1970s belie Jebel Ali's subsequent meteoric rise to become the world's largest manmade harbor. Its operator, state-owned DP World, also ranks high among port managers. DP World printed a 3.2% climb in gross container volumes in 2016 and 6% YoY growth in volumes in 4Q2016 alone. According to Arabian Business, this was despite Moody's December reduction to 'negative' of its 2017 outlook for the global shipping industry. Today, it has a portfolio of over 80 terminals on six continents and claims an approximate 9% global market share, ranking it among the top-five players, with a daily handling tally of over 170,000 TEUs. Testament to long-term thinking, Jebel Ali accommodates the largest vessels in the world, despite a doubling of the average container ship size over the past decade. The firm, whose facilities are used by over 180 shipping lines, provides over 90 weekly services connecting over 140 ports worldwide. And meanwhile, on annual investment of around USD1 billion, current total handling capacity is set to top out at 22.1 million TEUs by 2018.</p><p>Connectivity rules in logistics, and Jebel Ali exploits DP World's intermodal connectivity that links up sea, land, air, and soon rail, with the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza) boasting over 7,300 international companies. Back in 2014, DP World made a bigger commitment to the future of Jebel Ali by splashing USD2.6 billion on Economic Zones World (EZW), the operator of Jafza. </p><h4>FloatiNg Cities</h4><p>Dubai's appeal as a tourism and entertainment destination is rising, and many arrive afloat, notably at the Mina Rashid cruise port stretching around 2 million sqm, and able to accommodate 25,000 passengers at a time at its terminals. Mina Rashid, among a handful worldwide, can berth seven mega-cruise liners at once. Capacity was upped in 2015 with the addition of a third cruise terminal suitable for handling 14,000 passengers simultaneously. Meanwhile, coastal trade berths, general cargo, and roll-on roll-off facilities for car imports/re-exports are destined for relocation to Jebel Ali.<br></p><p>Sustained investment in port capacity and the fostering of a skilled workforce guarantee the future prosperity of Dubai's maritime sector and its status as a hub that facilitates commerce between East and West. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/6357c7cc-0cdf-42bb-8c89-0b028d665e9a.jpg","","","","Dubai's undisputed status as a global maritime hub, reinforced by a recent Menon Economics report that ranked Dubai fifth in the world in maritime capitals in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness, benefits from a regulated sector where investment keeps it at the cutting edge.","","","ships-ahoy","1527","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537aa8186b7b412f8a46323","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stakeholders across the country recognize the importance of health and wellness in ensuring the Emirate's continued prosperity, and large-scale efforts have been made to ensure Dubai is on the cutting edge of global health.</p><p>Relying on their long history of fostering partnerships between the government and private industry, officials in Dubai have developed a number of initiatives aimed at generating new generations of healthcare and health-oriented firms. Thanks to the resulting influx of investment, outpatient services have grown substantially in recent years, and outpatient visits have grown more than 10% a year since 2014. Additionally, the private sector captured the majority of these visits, accounting for just under 75%, while the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) accounted for 22%, bringing the Emirate closer to achieving its goal of a 70-30 split between private and public sector care. In terms of inpatient services, the Emirate is even closer to achieving its ideal split, with 68.6% of services being provided by private operators and 29.2% by the DHA. Additionally, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) in the Emirate was 50%, with private hospitals averaging 76.7% and DHA hospitals averaging 44.6%.</p><p>Healthcare services have traditionally been rather fragmented in Dubai, but consolidation is beginning to take hold, restructuring the industry in key ways. While there are currently almost 2,000 operational clinics in the Emirate, new requirements in the insurance industry and the industry's regulatory body have catalyzed consolidation. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Amitava Ghosal, CEO &amp; Board Member at Avivo Group, explained the impact new regulations have had on the sector, noting that they “have made it more difficult for the smaller players and the non-strategic investors to operate with the same kind of feasibility that they had anticipated."" According to Ghosal, this is likely to correct the sector's large-scale fragmentation, leading to a more regional health service.</p><p>According to the most recently available statistics from the DHA, the leading causes of death in the Emirate were cardiovascular and circulatory system disease (31.9%), cancer (18.2%), and respiratory disease (12.6%). A persistent health challenge has been the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, the high rates of which can be traced back to the sedentary lifestyles and high-calorie diets of many Emiratis. These conditions now affect nearly one in four Emiratis, and government officials have been working hard to develop plans tailored specifically to curb these diseases. The number of physicians and healthcare providers has grown quite significantly, with nearly 7,800 physicians working Dubai in 2015, representing growth of more than 66% since 2009. Dubai also has 3.3 physicians for every 1,000 people, the majority of which worked in the private sector. Additionally, there were nearly 8.9 nurses and 0.9 dentists per 1,000 people.</p><p>Part of the move toward improved service and quality care has been the development of the Dubai Healthcare City (DHCC). The city is a free zone dedicated to bringing the best medical practices and facilities to Dubai. Founded in 2002 by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the free zone occupies more than 26 million sqft and has more than 160 clinical partners. The DHCC is overseen by the Dubai Healthcare City Authority and regulated by international standards. The zone is designed to be a hub for medical development, and officials and industry observers are impressed with the high standards and success rate the city has had.<br>Dubai is trying to leverage its medical expertise and infrastructure to establish itself as a regional medical tourism hub. The DHA has enacted a number of initiatives aimed at stimulating this type of growth, and private firms and providers have invested heavily in medical tourism. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Dr. Mohaymen M. Abdelghany, CEO of Al Zahra Hospital Dubai, explained the vision and strides his hospital and the broader sector have made in this area. “As a hospital, we worked closely with the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) on the medical tourism initiative. Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid's vision is to have 500,000 medical tourists by 2020. This is going to be exceeded with current rates of growth, considering that in 2015 we had 300,000 medical tourists."" By providing world-class medical care, medical facilities in Dubai hope to attract patients from all across the world. “With the Dubai Tourism Department's continued support, I think we can get much larger exposure,"" said Abdelghany.</p><p>Additionally, hospitals are designing packages that combine a wide range of medical services with services traditionally provided by the travel industry. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Dr. Yashar Ali Abdulkader, acting CEO &amp; CMO of Canadian Specialist Hospital, explained his hospital's services. “When a tourism patient comes to see us we take care of them from the moment they land until departure. We make arrangements for their hotel, transport, and city tours."" To differentiate themselves from the growing competition, hospitals have needed to diversify their service offerings in interesting ways.</p><p>According to Alpen Capital, the GCC's healthcare market is expected to enjoy an impressive, 12.1% CAGR between 2015-2020, reaching a total value of roughly USD71 billion by 2020. With ambitious and far-reaching strategies in place, Dubai and the UAE are expected to garner a significant portion of this growth, further developing their domestic medical infrastructure. According to the Dubai Health Strategy 2016-2021, the Emirate has 15 strategic programs designed to improve different aspects of the health system in the next five years. These programs range from topics as diverse as prevention and healthy lifestyle, mental health, oral and dental care, and medical informatics and technology. Additionally, each strategic program has multiple strategic initiatives designed to transform health in Dubai in clear, easily measured ways.</p><p>Dubai's new mandatory health insurance plan has also met with such success that the program is being extended to Sharjah and the Northern Emirates. Government officials hope that the plan will extend coverage to a much greater portion of the population, and basic coverage packages range from AED550 to AED700.<br>With such impressive gains made thus far, Dubai is on its way to solidifying its status as a world-renowned medical and heath center. As the GCC and MENA continue to expand, Dubai's health sector well positioned to continue enjoying sizable growth. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/1fbf5775-f726-4dc6-960d-ee9ef78bb465.jpg","","","","With one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the region and a commitment to world-class care, Dubai is setting new standards for health and wellness.","","Health","healthy-and-happy","1675","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The UN-affiliated World Happiness Report showed that between 2013-15, Emiratis were happier than expats; independently, Emiratis were ranked at 7.06, equating to 15th, and the non-Emirati average was 6.48, which would have placed 31st. Given the large expat population, overall the UAE was placed 28th in the overall poll, a position upon which the UAE looks to improve.</p><p>On the ground, this has been taken to heart. “Make Dubai the happiest city on earth“ is the ambitious directive HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in his position as Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has set for Smart Dubai and its initiatives. As a result, the Smart Dubai Happiness Agenda, which is being led by the Dubai Smart Office and its technology arm, Dubai Smart Government, are spearheading this movement.</p><p>One manifestation of this agenda has been the Happiness Meter, described as a tool for live sentiment capture. It is the world's first citywide, live sentiment capture engine, and gauges satisfaction across the city. It was first introduced in the public sector, with the people of Dubai encouraged to rate their level of satisfaction with services provided by at least 14 government entities. Its simple design means it can either be a stand-alone unit within web sites or at physical locations, and the data provided to the host from the dashboard is anonymous, giving a comparative output without identifying the participants.</p><p>Users are presented with an interface that gives them three options; satisfied, neutral, and dissatisfied. The idea is that it can give spot-surveys and a real-time understanding of the feeling of happiness across the Emirate, and is Dubai's first strategic happiness smart initiative.</p><p>So far, the meters have been used to measure satisfaction with government services, and, according to the results, 89% of people are satisfied with the government's services. The Happiness Meter is next going to be rolled out to the other two-thirds of the economy, into the private sector.</p><p>Although many in the private sector already analyze their online traffic data to measure conversion rates, usability of their interfaces, and a plethora of other factors, the Happiness Meter is being seen as a further tool to help business owners increase their levels of service.</p><p>This reflects Dubai's general recipe for happiness, which is relatively straightforward: simplify citizens and residents' lives by creating technological solutions for practical problems. Another example of this drive for technology-based solutions is the DubaiNow app. In both English and Arabic, the app allows users to access 50 smart services from 22 government entities. For example, users can pay utilities and bills to DEWA, Etislat, or du, as well as pay traffic fines, or top up Salik. Users can renew vehicle registration, view road accident notifications, or track Dubai airport departures and arrivals, as well as find their nearest ATM. The app is designed to be a one-stop shop for government services, to make life easier for citizens and expats alike.<br>One particularly useful service is the rent analysis platform on the app, which can save individuals USD40,829 that they might typically pay banks or audit firms for the same information and service. This is seen as a direct response to what Emiratis feel about housing and the sense of frustration with the bureaucracy that had been surrounding it, making it difficult to have transparency and make the right personal investment decisions. This ability to be responsive is key to achieving the Emirate's happiness goals, removing barriers that frustrate and leave people unsatisfied with the Emirate.</p><p>Dubai, and the UAE, has put itself at the forefront of a global happiness agenda. That intent has been further crystalized by the introduction of the Minister of State for Happiness, which makes the UAE one of four countries, the others being Bhutan, Ecuador, and Venezuela, with a minister dedicated to this policy area. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Happiness","smiles-all-round","1345","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a47c86b7b412f8a4630d","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plan is for these three initiatvies to ensure seamless, accessible, and connected water and electricity services that meet living requirements, whilst monitoring usage. The intiative has numerous aspects, such as the implementation of meters that will monitor personal consumption and developing charging stations for hybrid and electric cars. </p><p>This Smart Grid strategy aims to rationalize energy usage across the domestic and commercial and transport sectors and falls under the Dubai Smart Initiative and the Dubai Green Energy Strategy for 2050. The green energy strategy aims to see the Emirate produce 75% of its energy from clean sources in the next 43 years. This has led to an Emirate-wide initiative spanning the public and private that looks wholesale at IT solutions that can drive sustainable practice. This ambition is to have a smart-led diversification of the energy make-up of Dubai that cement's the Emirate's ambition of being the smartest city in the world.</p><p>One aspect of this, and a new concept to the region, is for individuals and businesses to source their consumption through installed solar panels on the roof of their own premises, and for any excess energy generated to be funneled into the grid and sold to DEWA. This policy coincides with the Demand Side Management Strategy, which is geared towards a reduction in demand for both water and energy by 30% by 2021. Photovoltaic (PV) cell installation has been ongoing under the Shams initiative and although current numbers are in double-digits rather than triple, and the focus has been around government buildings and offices, with residential areas to be targeted, although a specific date has not be given as a deadline for this.<br>The most active part of this initiative so far has been DEWA's movements to implement over 1 million smart meters by 2020, of which 200,000 were installed by January 2016. The meters will provide users with information on their household consumption patterns, and is expected to help residents and industrial and commercial management teams look at more sustainable practices. They will also be a key aspect when needing to divert energy generated from installed solar panels back to the grid. </p><p>One barrier to widespread panel usage in the UAE has been an issue of maintenance. With high levels of sand and dust being kicked up by the wind and settling on the panels, the levels of solar-ray penetration are diminished. A suitable solution has been found for Abu Dhabi's Shams project, where automated sweepers brush the panels regularly.</p><p>In terms of charging stations for cars the majority of automotive manufacturers concur that it is the lack of infrastructure that is holding back the electric car industry. Porsche has just produced a car with a range of 500km achievable with just a 20-minute charge time. Its E-Mission car will be available by 2020 and it aims to sell 20,000 per annum through that time. At the moment, it is not an attractive purchase for potential car owners who cannot rely on the infrastructure to enable the usage of their car. There is some marks of progress, with DEWA announcing in December 2016 that 100 electric charging stations had been installed in the city.<br>Outside of the Smart Grid, 300 hybrid taxis (6% of current fleet) are already operational and should account for 50% of the taxis in operation by 2021. The targets are for a 10% share of all new purchased vehicles to be hybrid and electric vehicles from 2016-2020, and that by the same end date Dubai will be 2% eco-friendly across all vehicles, rising to 10% by 2030, with these cars emitting 33% fewer emissions.</p><p>Ceteris paribus, Dubai is embracing a smart-led strategy that will enable it to reach its 75% clean energy target by 2050. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","gridlock-no-longer","1433","552ef2b0361618126878404e","559a909a86b7b00bc0e2dd13","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The boom periods over the past three decades have brought some truly staggering growth to what was once a small fishing village on the Arabian Gulf—at one point in 2006, one out of every four cranes in the world could be found in the city. The economic crises of 2008, followed by the recent drop in oil prices, sparked a series of compounding effects that have combined to slow the city's economy and the growth of the sector. Still, there is a sense of optimism in the sector, largely due to Expo 2020 on the horizon and the increase in major projects it will bring.</p><h4>BY THE NUMBERS</h4><p>The state of the sector has been uneven since the global financial crisis, which brought an abrupt end to several years of uninterrupted growth. The construction sector saw mixed performances in 2016, but industry participants believe the worst days are over for the sector. The total value of Dubai's planned construction projects reached a high of USD390.7 billion in 2016, with USD53.5 billion of this related to projects in active construction. This is down slightly from 2015, but the slowed rate of decline is considered encouraging. Around 58% of projects in the execution and planning stages in 2016 were mixed-use facilities, with transport (14.6%) and residential (13.2%) the next two highest project categories. The increase in flows of credit to the sector showed increased investor confidence, with UAE lending up 14.8% in the first half of the year despite tightening in credit standards due to the fall in oil prices. After dropping to under USD32 billion in 1Q2012, the amount of credit delivered to the sector has grown in each of the past four years, rising to USD65.8 billion in 1Q2016.</p><p>The most promising sign of the recovering strength of the sector, however, was the increase in planned contracts. 1Q2016 saw USD6.6 billion of new contracts awarded, the highest figure since the peak of the construction boom in 2008, and the amount of new projects planned and breaking ground continued to accelerate through the end of the year. Seasonal trackers showed staffing levels and workloads rising to year-high levels at the end of the year; though marginal, the shift in the positive direction had industry participants optimistic about the direction the construction industry was heading at the end of 2016.</p><h4>EXPO 2020</h4><p>Overshadowing everything else in the sector is Expo 2020, which looms on the horizon as a source of hope for the industry. In 2013, Dubai was chosen to become the first MENA country to host the world's fair, and government officials have pledged to make the event a transformational experience. Preparations for the fair are well underway thanks to the Dubai government's plan to finish all construction more than a year in advance in order to ensure a well-run event. In conversations with construction industry participants, preparations for the Expo were on the minds of participants in every sector of the industry. With over USD27.2 billion to be awarded in contracts (20% allocated to SMEs), the spending for the Expo will touch every sector of the economy. The 2017 budget calls for a 3% increase in overall spending but a 27% rise in construction expenditures, as Dubai prepares for the Expo by strengthening its preexisting infrastructure platforms as well as building new facilities. Construction at the USD353 billion Expo 2020 site in Dubai South formally began in September 2013. The first work on the 4.38sqkm site involved constructing the Expo Village's 2,100 residential units. Additional infrastructure work is expected to begin shortly, followed by the construction of transportation infrastructure and a surface road network in late 2017. The end goal is for all infrastructure work to be completed more than a year in advance of the opening of the Expo in October 2020.</p><h4>TRANSPORT PROJECTS</h4><p>One of the most important infrastructure improvements planned for Expo 2020 is a USD2.9 billion extension to the Dubai Metro. In order to handle the Expo's estimated 25 million visitors, Route 2020, a 15km section of the red line that will extend from Nakheel Harbour to the Expo site, is scheduled to open in May 2020 and carry 35,000 Expo visitors a day during the week and 47,000 per day on weekends. Its seven stations include three serving Discovery Gardens and one each at Dubai Investments park and Golf City. In June 2016, Dubai's government signed a contract with a consortium of French, Spanish, and Turkish firms to begin construction. As with many other planned infrastructure projects, the benefits of the metro are planned to last beyond the life of the Expo. After the Expo ends, the line is expected to be extended an additional 6km to reach Al Maktoum International Airport. With an expected volume of 46,000 riders per hour in both directions, the arrival of the mass transit system should be a welcome source of efficiency for what is expected to become one of the world's busiest airports. In this regard, it is being welcomed by both contractors and residents alike as a project that will benefit all sectors of Dubai's population. The road and transport agency has stressed the need to bring the route through developed areas to make as much of an impact as possible in for the city's residents. <br>And Al Maktoum International is undergoing changes of its own. Dubai's rapid growth has put considerable pressure on Dubai International, which has become one of the busiest passenger airports in the world. In 2016, Dubai International saw more than 83 million passengers pass through, making it the busiest international airport in the world and putting it behind only Beijing and Atlanta for total passengers. It is expected to hit its capacity of 90 million by 20 million, limiting the city's tourism and business potential unless Al Maktoum can help pick up the slack. Al Maktoum has grown considerably since opening in 2013, and saw more than 850,000 passengers pass through the airport, almost double its 2015 total of 461,000. Recognizing the importance of establishing a second air traffic hub, Dubai's government has launched an ambitious project to grow Al Maktoum's annual capacity from its current 5 million passengers to 220 million passengers by 2025, making it the biggest airport in the world. The first phase, the largest airport construction project in world history, will bring Al Maktoum's capacity up to 130 million passengers a year by 2022. The expansion will also allow the airport to triple its cargo capacity from 4 million to 12 million tons a year. At more than USD27.2 billion over the life of the expansion, the project will be primarily financed by debt, and a number of French, Italian, and UAE firms are already well underway working on new terminal facilities, runways, roads, and transportation facilities, with the first stage expected to be completed within two years. The airport will also serve as a keystone for further development of the Dubai South region.</p><h4>GREEN BUILDING</h4><p>While all this construction is underway, Dubai will be taking care to incorporate new green building standards into its projects. One of the sub-themes of Expo 2020 is sustainability, and in keeping with this theme industry, participants have been taking new steps to ensure that the city's long-term environmental health remains strong. Dubai's Green Building Regulations and Specifications went into effect in 2012 for public buildings and in 2014 for private commercial ones. The regulations merge international standards with Dubai-specific elements to produce facilities that limit water and electricity consumption. Since 2012, more than 1,400 green building projects have been completed, with an additional 120 million sqft of real estate registered with the city for green construction. In 2016, Dubai's government took its green certification program an additional step by launching the Al Safat green building rating system. The rating calls for platinum, gold, silver, and bronze classifications, and all upcoming construction must at a minimum meet bronze certification. More than 90% of buildings constructed after 2001 already meet the bronze certification levels, but by standardizing the system and urging developers to meet higher standards the Dubai government anticipates carbon dioxide reductions of 20%—an effect equal to planting 36 million trees over the next five years.</p><p>The construction industry has responded well to these new regulations, recognizing the need for such standards and finding new potential in large-scale environmental projects. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park is one such example of new construction created by the city's shift toward green technologies. First proposed in 2008, the USD2 billion project has completed two phases and now produces enough energy to power 50,00 Dubai homes. The plant is the world's cheapest operating solar plant, and further price decreases are expected due to the falling price of photovoltaic panels. Construction began on the third phase of the mark in early 2017, with an expected completion date of 2020, and a tender for the fourth phase is expected to be issued shortly. Industry leaders expect projects like these to continue to emerge as the government looks for new sources of energy and industry to support the ever-growing city. The alignment of industry and social goals means that the sector appears ready to play a key role in the construction of Dubai's future for years to come. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/82a55b04-b17c-4109-b3b9-03245c817457.jpg","","","","Dubai's construction sector has weathered slow years and looks poised to begin growing again thanks to a new wave of large-scale projects linked to Expo 2020.","","Construction","building-a-tomorrow","1638","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet according to HE Wessam Lootah, CEO of Smart Dubai Government, the goal of the Smart Dubai vision is no less than leveraging those zeroes and ones, “to make Dubai the happiest city on earth."" This notion of happiness is based upon a customer-centric approach that underpins the delivery of data and provision of government services, and on the systematic measurement of how those services are accessed and perceived, by business and citizen alike. In May 2016, the official Happiness Agenda was launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister &amp; Vice-President of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai. And thus far, the indications are good, as meters deployed across 500 state-sector touch points had, by mid-2016, toted up a city-wide 89% happiness level.</p><p>The responsibility for ensuring a smooth rollout of related technology falls to HE Dr. Aisha bin Butti bin Bishr, Director General of Smart Dubai Office. Yet ultimately, the innovative dynamo of Smart City Dubai is seamless collaboration between public and private sectors across industry and academia. For business, she explained in a TBY interview, ""In terms of ICT infrastructure, we have implemented an artificial intelligence tool called Saad in partnership with the Department of Economic Development."" This ""new personal concierge"" replies to all business-related questions to expedite commercial processes. She also cites, ""DubaiNow, a mobile app created by the Smart Dubai Government, unifies several government and private sector applications into one, which means that people no longer require hundreds of applications for government services.""</p><h4>Proof in Numbers</h4><p>The Smart Government initiative emerged in 2013, at which point the Digital City ambition was upgraded to the results-oriented Smart City project, its Smart Platform initiated in 1Q2016. The financial advantages of the move toward full digital transformation is clear, and HE Wesam Lootah cites a state-commissioned independent study that, ""...found savings of USD1.2 billion, of which USD327 million was saved in the government shared services area (and which makes) a 300% savings on a spend of USD105 million."" Meanwhile, according to Tayfun Topkoc, Managing Director for the UAE of SAP, that firm's Ariba cloud system has the potential to save the UAE state sector USD272 million per annum. Data integrity, too, is a major consideration. Accordingly, automated Blockchain technology that mitigates systemic weakness and financial irregularity is set to be fully implemented across the state sector by 2020.</p><p>The guiding hand of ICT is felt far beyond the state sphere, ranging from paperless shipping at Dubai's megaports to efficiently nurturing SMEs. HE Dr. Aisha bin Butti bin Bishr stressed that the launch of the Dubai Data Platform expands, ""our services and initiatives to cater to all entrepreneurs and start-ups in Dubai so that they can benefit from government data. The platform provides, “analytical tools to deal with big data and enriched data pulled from the Internet of Things around the city.""</p><h4>Dubai Internet City</h4><p>We live in an era where one-size-fits-all software solutions are no longer uniformly adequate. And while the public sector remains the prime investor in ICT solutions, its coffers also notably foster the incubation of private sector innovation that will further advance the march of the data economy. Dubai contains the region's most comprehensive technology community, effectively its very own Silicon Valley—Dubai Internet City. At around 1.5 million sqft of office space, it provides a cohesive focal point for the entire ICT value chain. The ICT hub has for more than 15 years offered soft terms, including taxation and ownership rights to start-up SMEs and major international players such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, Dell, Intel, and Huawei alike, guaranteed by law for 50 years.</p><h4>And... Action!</h4><p>Majed Al Suwaidi is the Managing Director of Dubai Media City, Dubai Studio City &amp; Dubai Production City, and another sectoral example of the innovative minds propelling Dubai to the forefront of ICT implementation. Identifying a core audience for creative products, he noted that data views on mobile phones had, ""jumped from 11% in 2011 to almost 70% in 2015 (whereby) the industry is focused on younger audiences and new platforms for content."" In fact, Dubai Studio City, the largest studio spanning 50,000sqft, has recently partnered with YouTube to open the first YouTube Space in the MENA region, and tap a young and tech-savvy region where almost 50% of the population is under 24 years of age. Which neatly segues into...</p><h4>...Mobile &amp; Internet</h4><p>Majed Al Suwaidi continues that, ""2017-2018 is set to be an era of many 'mobile-first' markets in the MENA region, and the stage of content on the small screen."" Mobile penetration across the UAE in 2015 had approached close to 210%. Data from the UAE's Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA)  respectively puts 2015 pre-paid and post paid mobiles users on 15.4 million and 2.8 million. Mobile Number Portability (MNP) became possible in December 2013, and for 2015 a monthly average of 11,524 mobile subscribers opted to switch between operators, up from 9,126 the year before, underlining the competitive climate. Tellingly, in 2015 the average monthly minutes per user (AMPU) print for post-paid users of 329 was up from 274 in 2014 on a steady upward trajectory. In contrast, the prepaid figure of 117 was down from 2019 a year earlier, continuing a downtrend. Also indicative of users increasingly choosing to pay more for desirable services, 2015 pre-paid revenues of USD844 million were down from USD4 billion in 2014, while for the period, post-paid revenues had risen from USD2.68 billion to USD3.2 billion. And glancing at the ""www"", as of for 2015 the UAE's 14.4% internet penetration had risen from 12.9% in 2014 on 1.2 million subscriptions. Total revenues of USD1.6 billion were up YoY from USD1.3 billion, sustaining upward annul momentum.</p><p>Etisalat, a major telco in Dubai's mobile market (53.1% market share as of 4Q2016), is primed to capitalize on Dubai's fast-approaching major event, Expo 2020. This will be a vital international showcase for the country, which already spearheads the region's telecoms, ICT, and consumer electronics markets, having also built the infrastructure to champion local content. Etisalat, present in 18 markets across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa with 167 million subscribers in 2015, is working to launch next-generation 5G services across the UAE in 2018, specifically to highlight the full scope of the Smart City initiative, ahead of the big event. The telco's overall 9M2016 net profit of USD1.7 billion was up 9% YoY. And while YoY growth for the group's UAE operations were down 1% for the period, its Pakistani operations registered an impressive double-digit print of 22%. Etisalat Group's 2016 revenues climbed 2.01% YoY to USD14.3 billion largely on the back  of UAE and Maroc Telecom operations. Indeed, in Etisalat's six biggest markets, namely Pakistan, the UAE, Saudi, Egypt, Nigeria, and Morocco around 50% of the population is younger than 25, boding well for potential data sales.</p><h4>New Angles</h4><p>Back in the UAE, package and price competition is the state of play. Officially called Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC), du, with a 46.9% market share as of 4Q2016, is the second player in the UAE mobile market. du's FY2016 total revenues of USD3.5 billion were up a slender 0.3% YoY. The 2016 net profit before royalties of USD1.1 billion was up 0.1% YoY; this was kinder than the 2015 decline in net profit of 8%, where royalty fees paid to the government had cut deep.</p><p>A decade old this year, du has celebrated with special offers for pre-paid and post-paid mobile customers of 10GB for the price of 1GB, 20GB for the price of 5GB, and 50GB for the price of 25GB during a 30-day period to whet appetites for data. Tapping, and it seems even cannibalizing, user groups is par for the course in the telecoms arena. Because at the start of 2017, du launched its second brand in the UAE, Virgin Mobile. The telco stresses that this will not be a license-holding third operator, or operate as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in the UAE."" Rather, Virgin is to be positioned to take some users from Etisalat, while cannibalizing some of its own customers by tapping the tourist market, more familiar with the Virgin brand.</p><h4>In the Rankings</h4><p>The UAE's TRA monitors the performances of the two local operators. Selected results for 2015 were based on data reading across all the Emirates, with key highways and buildings included. The latest study indicates that while du's voice quality was superior for outdoor calls, Etisalat's was better for indoor calls. In terms of voice quality, du printed at 97.02% and Etisalat at 95.33%. And in terms of call drop rates Etisalat, at 0.25%, just pipped du, at 0.30%, to the post. Meanwhile, regarding double service coverage for both 2G and 3G, both Etisalat and du exceeded 99% by TRA numbers.</p><h4>And on a Wider Scale</h4><p>On a regional and international scale, the UAE's ICT achievements are impressive. The 2016 International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Measuring the Information Society report, since 2009, benchmarked and assessed the progress of its information society. It includes the ICT Development Index that annually gauges the level of ICT development across 175 global economies. The UAE ranks a high 38th in the world, and second among all GCC and Arab nations. Among notable achievements, the UAE ranked eighth in the world both by household internet access and by households with personal computers. Furthermore, in the Networked Readiness Index, which measures an economy's ability to leverage ICT to boost competitiveness and development, ranked the UAE first among Arab states and 23rd among all 143 participating countries. And finally, the 2016-2017 World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), which establishes the microeconomic and macroeconomic foundations of national competitiveness, placed the UAE 16th out of 138 countries in the GCI and first among all Arab states. Among the benchmarks of the competitiveness index is Technological Readiness and Innovation, which is nothing if not the primary directive of Smart Dubai. <br>In short, Dubai, like the wider UAE, is extremely proactive in shaping the technological foundations of the information economy. And while the market is competitive, innovation is leaving no stone unturned for growth. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/b0284169-993b-4b65-be7d-1c550aea81c0.jpg","","","","The future of Dubai is smart, as even abstract concepts like happiness are assigned a numeric value.","","","get-smart","2278","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a47c86b7b412f8a4630d","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oil is finite, after all, and recent fluctuations in global oil prices have made readily apparent the need to diversify and develop alternate sources of energy and industrial revenue. Already blessed with deep pockets and a forward-thinking government, Dubai is well positioned to become a leader in the next generation of MENA industry. A series of strategic plans and alternative energy projects are already underway, paving the way for a bright future.</p><h4>REDUCED RELIANCE ON OIL</h4><p>Oil makes up a smaller proportion of Dubai's revenue than outsiders might expect considering the UAE's reputation as an oil exporter. While the UAE was the world's seventh-largest oil producer as of 2016, the share of GDP and revenue coming from oil exports has fallen in recent years with the drop in oil prices. As of 2014, 35% the UAE's tax revenues and 36.8% of its exports came from the oil industry, and this rate is expected to fall in the future in concert with declining oil prices. While the UAE's oil revenue proportion might seem high, it is actually already a leader within the GCC in terms of diversifying its economy; as of 2014 it was the only oil-exporting Arab country for which oil wasn't a main export good, and its economic diversity as measured by the IMF's economic complexity index was ranked as one of the best in the region. If the UAE as a whole has been making strides in moving away from oil dependence through economic diversity, Dubai stands out as the strongest success case within the UAE. While still heavily involved in the petroleum industry, it is actually a net oil importer, consuming more gas and oil than it produces. The UAE as a whole has set a goal to limit oil's share of GDP growth to 20% by 2020, and the growth of Dubai's tourism and services sectors over the last decade has resulted in just 6% of government revenue coming from oil in 2016. A similar proportion is expected in 2016; though revenue overall is expected to decline, Dubai's government still anticipates oil revenue to remain steady at 6% of revenue. </p><h4>RENEWABLES</h4><p>Renewables are one of the foundational elements of Dubai's future energy plans. In 2015, Dubai's government announced the launch of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 plan, a sweeping structural investment blueprint that calls for more than USD163 billion in renewables investment by the middle of the century. The plan calls for 7% of Dubai's power output to come from clean energy by 2020, 25% by 2030, and 75% by 2050. The government's goals are for 44% of energy to come from renewable sources, 38% from gas, 12% from clean fuels, and 6% from nuclear energy, making Dubai the city with the smallest carbon footprint in the world.<br>One of the core projects for the Emirate's energy strategy is the Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park at Al Marmoum. Once completed in 2030, the USD13.6 billion park will be the largest single solar project in the world, with a planned capacity of 5,000MW that will be enough to power 800,000 homes. Construction began in 2012, and the first two phases of the solar park began operational in 2013 and 2016, bringing more than 2,000MW of energy to the grid. The third phase, to be completed in 2030, has begun construction and will bring 800MW to the grid once completed. The original plan for the project called for capacity of 1,000MW once completed, but the rapidly falling cost of solar energy has led to an expansion of the project beyond what any outside observers foresaw. The cost of solar panels has more than halved since the solar park was inaugurated, and energy production from the second phase was the cheapest in the world at only USD0.0584 cents per kWh. With prices expected to continue to drop, the Dubai government is planning to turn the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park into a hub not just for electricity production, but for renewables innovation. Current plans call for the construction of innovation and research and development centers on the grounds of the solar plant, where some of the renewables sector's leading minds will use data from the plant to improve energy technology by improving reliability and efficiency. Dubai also anticipates the innovation center becoming a hub for solar education, spreading awareness and linking some of the world's top renewables researchers.<br>The aforementioned solar plant is the largest infrastructure project planned for the Clean Energy Strategy, but the Emirate's green fund has more than USD27 billion earmarked for other green fuels, and work is well underway on developing alternative sources. In 2013, for example, Dubai began the GCC's largest landfill gas recovery project at the Al Qusais landfill. The largest landfill in Dubai, Al Qusais receives more than 7,000 tons of waste per day, generating significant amounts of methane. Energy firm Green Energy Sustainability Solutions (GESS) installed almost 25km of pipe under the site to collect the pressurized gas, funnel it to a production site, and burn it to power an electric engine. The total amount collected isn't on the same scale as a solar plant, but GESS CEO Anita Nouri sees the project as an important step in solving Dubai's long-term environmental and energy problems. “All of the landfill sites in the entire MENA region are emitting gas, which is 60% methane and causing tremendous harm to our environment,"" Nouri told TBY. “De-gassing all landfills is a must and using that gas to produce electricity is a natural step."" Nouri believes that there is still considerable educational and incentive work to be done, but the project is already making international waves. Aside from providing clean energy, the landfill gas program is registered under the United Nations' Clean Development Mechanism, making it eligible for global carbon credits programs. By keeping more than 300,000 tons of greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere each year, GESS receives carbon credits that can be traded internationally or used to fund additional projects. 2016 saw GESS receive a check for USD96,423 for selling some credits to the Norwegian government to offset its carbon footprint.</p><h4>COOLING</h4><p>While energy production is getting cleaner and more efficient, Dubai's green energy plan also calls for reductions on the demand side as well. The government is taking steps to dramatically reduce the energy used by the cooling systems that account for two-thirds of all building energy consumption. One new strategy is district cooling, which cools buildings by running water from an centralized location to increase efficiency. HE Ahmad M. Bin Shafar, CEO of Empower, Dubai's largest cooling firm, believes that the energy-saving benefits of the Emirate's district cooling system make it a key part of Dubai's energy initiatives. “District cooling is the future of energy in Dubai,"" Shafar told TBY. “It is one of the main pillars of all industrial applications in Dubai now and wherever you go you will find water and electricity derived from district cooling."" As the district cooling sector develops rapidly, one of the key issues facing the sector is the distribution of capital costs. The lack of clear industry guidelines has at times led to increased consumption, but the introduction of meters for individual apartments and the impending arrival of a governmental regulatory framework have the sector ready to attain a new stability. Success in this area also has significant financial implications; IMF figures estimate that the UAE's energy subsidies cost it USD29 billion annually. With demand expected to continue rising by 9% per year in Dubai, the increased efficiency district cooling brings will be essential to the future of the Emirate. </p><h4>INDUSTRY</h4><p>Dubai's energy industry has also taken on a more significant role in recent years. The Emirate is using its position as a global hub for trade and logistics to set up industrial zones integrated into its preexisting logistical structures, building a sustainable framework well-positioned to be a major part of the economy for years to come. June 2016 saw Dubai launch its Industrial Strategy 2030 initiative, which identified as its central goal turning the Emirate into a “global platform for knowledge-based, sustainable, and innovative industries."" The plan identified six industrial sectors of particular importance to the future of Dubai: aerospace, maritime, pharmaceuticals, aluminum and fabricated metals, fast moving consumable goods, and machinery. These six industries already have well-established ties with Dubai firms (Emirates Airlines, for example, is a global aviation leader) and their continued development is a natural step for the Emirate. Dubai also has 18 industrial areas, eight of which are located within designated free zones. Government regulation of the free zones has been widely praised, with industry leaders around the world drawn to invest in Dubai thanks to its attractive business environment. Dubai Refreshment CEO Tarek El Sakka summed up the general perception, telling TBY that, “The business environment in general is very positive, and government services are very accessible. The processes are transparent and efficient, and moreover the infrastructure that exists…  is very supportive."" GDP from industrial production has ranged from 11% to 14% over the past decade, and the Dubai government is well aware that increasing that percentage is a necessary step to further protect the Emirate from the volatility of oil prices. With the sector projected to create 27,000 jobs and R&amp;D investment expected to rise by USD191 million by 2030, the sector looks well on its way to meeting these challenges. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/819e0607-904d-4887-a23e-98b610e49d81.jpg","","","","Already less dependent on oil exports than its neighbors, heavy investment in renewables has Dubai well positioned to achieve a stable energy future.","","","powered-up","1633","552ef2b0361618126878404e","559a909a86b7b00bc0e2dd13","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-15T03:53:00.000Z","2017-08-15T03:53:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Security Now","<p>The GCC as a whole has historically learned to deal with low rates of insurance penetration, but recent events have given the sector newfound optimism. The passage of mandatory health insurance laws in Dubai raised coverage rates and dramatically increased the size of the city's insurance market, producing strong growth numbers in the midst of an oil-induced slowdown. Moving forward, insurance companies will look to take advantage of Dubai's strong economy and the megaprojects planned for Expo 2020, while expanding coverage options and bringing new policies to the region.</p><h4>HEALTHCARE</h4><p>On January 1, 2014, Dubai's Health Insurance Law went into effect, marking a new era of healthcare coverage in the Emirate. The law called for all Dubai employers to provide health insurance coverage for their employees and implement an integrated health system that seeks to provide options for both businesses and individuals. This means that Dubai's nearly 3 million citizens now all have access to mandatory healthcare, though the extent of the coverage available varies depending on citizenship status and employment. The rollout took place in phases; in the original law, health insurance became mandatory for companies with more than 1,000 employees after October 31, 2014; companies with 100-999 employees after July 31, 2015; and companies with fewer than 100 employees after June 30, 2016. Noncompliance was to be punished with fines linked with the visa system; Dubai's Health Authority (DHA) began a new plan in concert with the General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA) that would have the GDRFA check insurance statuswhen renewing or cancelling a visa, with a fine of AED500 for every month the visa holder was insured.</p><p>However, the deadline for individual coverage has been pushed back twice as the DHA works with insurance companies to alleviate confusion and ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to choose a plan that is right for them. In June 2016, less than a month before the original deadline for insurance for individuals, the DHA extended the grace period to the end of 2016 in order to generate more time for insurance companies to work with the public to form basic insurance packages. Six months later, a resolution extended the deadline again to March 31, 2017 due to a surge in registrations that left insurance companies struggling to handle all claims and the need for further education on citizens' obligations to purchase insurance. This resolution also directed insurance companies to cover Sharjah and the Northern Emirates, as previously several companies did not offer coverage plans in these regions. Since many people with Dubai residency visas live in these regions, the lack of healthcare coverage there meant that they were unable to purchase plans that provided coverage. Introducing these new plans should go a ways toward closing the final coverage gap.</p><p>Insurance rates have been strong thus far, with reports indicating that 98% of Dubai citizens have health insurance, and DHA officials are optimistic that the remaining 25,000 residents without it will attain coverage in early 2017. The high rates of coverage speak to the general success of the program, but wide-scale implementation has not been without its issues, most of which have been due to the sheer volume of applications companies have had to deal with. Aside from the aforementioned issues with regional coverage, Dubai residents have expressed concerns about a lack of affordable plans for those who do not qualify for the DHA's Essential Benefits Package (EBP), a minimum level of coverage plan designed for people earning less than USD1,089 per month. Senior citizens and unmarried women, in particular, are two groups that many feel pay unfairly high premiums if their earnings push them outside the EBP range. Still, coverage options have been improving and with 50 companies currently providing coverage, the industry is poised to turn the sudden growth into a lasting industry.</p><h4>UAE TRENDS</h4><p>The larger UAE has been experiencing an economic slowdown in recent years due to the drop in oil prices. The UAE's 29 listed insurance companies reported a profit of USD84.4 million in the first half of 2016, but that figure was distorted by a one-time profit of USD110 million by one company. With that figure removed, the overall profit for the industry was negative USD26.1 million over the same timeframe. The industry has been particularly affected by a number of high-profile fires in the UAE, which have led to massive payouts. A fire at Dubai's Address Hotel on New Year's Eve 2015, for example, led to an insurance claim of USD332.2 million. 2015 also saw fires at the Torch Tower in February and the Regal Office Tower in November, leading insurance and government officials to reexamine building codes and urge developers to limit the use of flammable materials like aluminum composite panels. A 2016 investigation by one Dubai newspaper found that most skyscrapers built in the city before 2012 had non-fire-rated exterior panels. However, insurance executives stressed that the fires still remained isolated incidents that had not lead to significantly higher premiums marketwide.</p><p>More pressing than the city's fire issues was the wider economic effects of a fall in oil. While the UAE's insurance sector saw its gross written premiums rise from USD10 billion in 2015 to USD10.9 billion in 2016, slowdowns across several key markets led to lowered growth and concerns about the future of the sector. Still, there is reason for optimism, in part because Dubai enjoys a more diversified economy than many of its neighbors. In contrast to Saudi Arabia, which saw its medical insurance sector contract after oil sector layoffs, Dubai's tourism and construction industries provide another source of insurance opportunities for the sector, and the looming number of large-scale construction projects are primed to boost the industry in the years to come. Dubai plans to award more than USD3 billion in construction projects in the run up to Expo 2013, and the long-term effects of this boom should bode well for the insurance sector.</p><h4>ROOM TO GROW</h4><p>The UAE requires drivers to purchase auto insurance, and the sector has seen continued growth over recent years thanks to Dubai's development. Premiums rose in late 2016 in what insurance executives said was a necessary step to correct pricing and responding to new tariffs. These new premiums are expected to increase the share of the market beyond its current 40%. Another sector currently with a much smaller size but the potential for growth is home insurance; the aforementioned fire issues have helped raise awareness among Dubai citizens of its importance. One 2016 survey by an Qatari insurance company found that only 9% of UAE residents had home insurance, due in part to almost half of Dubai residents renting their home. With home insurance plans available at USD60 annually, the industry wants to push for increased coverage, establishing a precedent that can hopefully be carried over to other underperforming sectors like and travel insurance. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Dubai's mandatory healthcare law has led to growth in the insurance sector, but firms still see significant untapped potential in a number of markets.","","Insurance","security-now","1548","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And meanwhile, the instruments available to the investor have increased in range, while the regulations that make the Emirate a hospitable investment destination have been tightened, not least in the gigantic sharia-compliant market, as we shall see later. In fact, Dubai's financial markets per se position the Emirate as the leading finance destination between Singapore and London.</p><h4>The DFM</h4><p>Dubai's capital markets are a double-edge sword comprising the Dubai Finance Market (DFM) and the Nasdaq Dubai. The former, established in 2000, seven years later became the Middle East's first exchange to opt for an IPO, subsequently playing a key role in the spin-off of state entities. The exchange, operating in compliance with sharia principles, is an onshore entity, and, therefore, unlike the Nasdaq Dubai, is regulated by the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA). In another regional first, in 2010 the Dubai Financial Market consolidated its operations with Nasdaq Dubai, enabling seamless trading across both bourses using a single investor number. Today, the shares of 61 companies trade on the DFM.</p><h4>2016 at a Glance</h4><p>For FY2016 the DFM printed a net profit of USD69.1 million, down notably from the USD207 million seen just two years before. The bourse accounts the—much slighter—YoY dip in terms of a 12% slippage in trading value to USD36.4 billion from USD41.4 billion for 2015, plus a 1% rise in expenses. Trading revenues accounted for 64% of the DFM's total revenues for the year.</p><p>In terms of equity performance, the Dubai Financial Market General Index (DFMGI) appreciated 12.1% to 3,531 points at end-2016 compared to 3,151 points at end-2015. Peering into the specific sectors we note that eight out of the nine sectors catered to DFM closed 2016 positively, with the services sector in the green by 36%. It was trailed by the consumer staples and discretionary sector, up 22.1%, and telecommunication sector, up 21.6%. The industrial sector in contrast shed a leaden 16.7% as global noise dented confidence in future performance. Market capitalization climbed 12.3% to USD91.9 billion YoY, while the value of shares traded, down 8.7% YoY, topped out at USD36.2 billion. This came despite the annual rise in the number of shares traded of 14.2% to 105.8 billion shares, compared to 92.7 billion shares traded in 2015. The transaction number, too, was down 14.4% to 1.3 million compared to 1.5 million deals a year earlier. Sector wise, the real estate and construction sector led the top three by traded value on USD15.6 billion, a sizable 43% of the market's total traded value. The banking sector followed on USD9.6 billion, or 26.5%, while the financial and investment services sector printed USD3.6 billion, claiming 10%.</p><p>For the year, the DFM's net foreign investment inflow was at USD98.1 million, with stocks bought by foreign investors  valued at USD16.5 billion, and accounting for 45.5% of the total traded value. And the value of stocks sold by those investors reached USD16.4 billion on 45.2% of total value traded. On 30% of total traded value, the value of stocks consumed by institutional investors came to USD10.9 billion. The value of stocks sold by that investor group for 2016 was USD10.3 billion, on 28.4% of total value traded. This made for a net institutional investment in-flow of USD599 million. More recently, as of March 27, 2017 the DFMGI had shed 0.66% for the week, 4.9% MoM, and 2.17% YtD. Yet it had appreciated by 5.34% over the previous year. The index posted a 52-week high of 3,738.69 on Feb 09, 2017, and a 52-week low of 3,195.49 on Nov 14, 2016. In 2016, the DFM saw the listing of Kuwait's National International Holding (NIH) Company, raising the number of listed securities to 61 public joint-stock companies, with 13 dually listed companies. The total number of Kuwait-listed companies reached nine. Further activity from Kuwait registered in the sukuk arena, underling the DFM's international appeal. Incidentally, 2016 also saw the listing of Al Safwa Islamic Financial Services, which became the first private joint-stock company listed on the DFM's Second Market.</p><h4>Regulation and Standardization</h4><p>Market reputation, and the regulation that safeguards it, is everything, and in April 2016, a new regulatory body, the Dubai Economic Security Centre (DESC), was established in the Emirate under Law No. 4 of 2016. It functions as another firewall against potential irregularity that could impact the broader economy, specifically the financial universe. Notably, the DESC is mandated to oversee both the onshore and free zone markets. Standards of operation, too, have been fine-tuned, whereby in March 2017 the DFM published the definitive version of its Standard on Hedging against Investment and Finance Risks, a pioneering document that will advance the Emirate's capital markets in a turbulent world of fleeting investor sentiment. The standard is an addition to DFM's sharia-compliant protocol covering the Standard on Stocks and Standard on Sukuk issued in 2007 and 2014, respectively. Two risk types prominently addressed are property risk to be borne by the owner, who is liable for damage or loss of his property, and secondly reputational risk pertaining to sharia incompliance. The latter is particularly important as the sharia universe has been working to eliminate ambiguity surrounding Islamic interpretation of ever-diversifying financial instruments. The DFM has, after all, been the world's sharia-finance torch bearer since 2007, and further clarification can boost the volume of Islamic banks and financial institutions.</p><h4>Nasdaq Dubai, the Future's Good</h4><p>This exchange is a different kettle of fish, which being located within the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC) free zone, like the Dubai Gold &amp; Commodities Exchange (DGXC) and Dubai Mercantile Exchange, is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). Its principle advantage is that the onshore restrictions on foreign ownership do not apply. It offers investors a multi-asset and currency platform, where listed companies enjoy a simultaneous presence on both the local and international market. The bourse trades bonds, equities, derivatives, and real estate investment trusts, and is also a Murabaha (property financing) platform.</p><p>In March 2016, Nasdaq Dubai CEO Hamed Ali reported that it was poised to introduce futures contracts for Dubai Investment Company and Dubai Financial Market by early April, thus increasing the total number of such shares to 11.</p><p>The UAE's IPO activity for the year kicked off in March with the well oversubscribed listing of Emirates NBD's real estate investment trust (ENBD REIT) on the Nasdaq Dubai. ENBD REIT offered 94,594,595 ordinary shares at USD1.11/share, whereby the stock rose 5.17% to USD1.17/share.</p><h4>Sukuks Plough Ahead</h4><p>The Nasdaq Dubai has earned its stripes as a major sharia instrument provider, notably sukuks. By early June 2016,  Nasdaq Dubai had seen the listing of seven new sukuks valued at USD4.55 billion. At that point it was trading around 80 listed sukuks and bonds with the latter accounting for a full three quarters of the total. <br>On October 10, 2016 Nasdaq Dubai and Ideal Ratings launched benchmark indices that track the performance of global sukuk, thus providing investors a more meaningful basis for informed trading decisions. Tracking over 1,800 sukuks worldwide with eligibility criteria that include a minimum issue size of USD100 million, data provided includes daily changes in price and total return, and monthly updates on yield and other core indicators. The new Nasdaq Dubai IdealRatings Sukuk Indices family features the Global Sukuk Index covering all currencies, and five sub-indices of issuances denominated solely in US dollars. The latter five comprise investment grade issuances, sovereign issuances, corporate issuances, issuances by financial institutions, and GCC issuances. In March, Kuwait's Warba Bank listed a USD250million sukuk to bolster its capital base and enable sustained growth. According to the DIFC, the move confirmed expanding collaboration between the UAE and Kuwaiti capital markets, as well as Nasdaq Dubai's global leader status for sukuk listings; recent data indicate a total nominal value of USD46.31 billion in sukuk from issuers in the MENA region and further afield.</p><h4>Derivative, in a Good Way</h4><p>The Dubai Gold &amp; Commodities Exchange (DGCX), operating under the Dubai Commodities Clearing Corporation (DCCC), was launched in 2005. Essentially geared toward the trading of precious metals, it is also expand into foreign exchange, equity indices, and energy market trading. Not only the region's leading derivatives exchange, it is the only one through which participants can clear and settle transactions within the Gulf region. Volatility sparked by international events, not least Brexit and those unfolding stateside, but the Indian rupee devaluation and US Fed measures have also reverted to the safe(er) haven of derivative trading. In consequence, for 2016, the exchange posted a historical high trading volume on an aggregate of 19.7 million contracts, valued at USD439.5 billion. With a daily average of 76,835 contracts in 2016, the DGCX also printed its highest ever Average Daily Volumes (ADV). Strongest was the performance of the DGCX's currency segment, up 34% YoY, where Indian rupee products notably rose 34% from 2015. Meanwhile, the DGCX gold basket rose 61% YoY; gold futures climbed 29%) with Gold Quanto—a cash-settled, cross-currency derivative where the underlying asset is denominated in a currency other than that in which the option is settled—rose 158%. The DGCX's prestige was underlined when a pioneering deal was struck in 2016 with the Shanghai Gold Exchange to launch the Shanghai Gold contract in Dubai. Its significance cannot be overstated in that now an exchange beyond China is able to direct regional investors to the world's largest bullion market. And with no likely end to volatility in 2017, a similar performance for derivative products turned to for hedging and investment purposes may well be anticipated for the year. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Capital Markets","robust-and-diversified","1441","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-11T06:19:00.000Z","2017-08-11T06:19:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A new rule book","<p>Law 9 of 2016 was the year's biggest piece of legislation. The long-awaited bill is designed to tackle the estimated USD5 billion worth of non-performing loans in the UAE. January 1, 2017 saw the implementation of the law, but businesses have been afforded some time to return to solvency before its full implementation.</p><p>The need for a gap is a symptom of the old legal framework, which punished businesses that struggled with cash flow. Article 24 of the Commercial Transactions Law 1993 stated that any individual declared bankrupt in the first year of practicing their trade cannot trade until “rehabilitated,“ or had paid off the entirety of their debt. This provided a catch-22 as the individual may not have any means of repaying the monies owed subsequent to becoming insolvent, leading to the business owner becoming economically inactive. At the same time, the law prescribed that those who are self-employed, largely being small business owners, were not required to keep their books. This represented a double-edged legislative sword, creating a system that did not do enough to discourage malpractice and then criminalized those whose businesses failed.</p><p>Compounding the issue, there was no structure for post-commencement financing or repaying the outstanding balance. This meant that the UAE suffered from a lot of skip cases and had a low recovery of cents on the dollar, at 29, while countries in the OECD achieve almost 73 on average. </p><p>The new law also applies on a much wider scale than the previous commercial code, covering most fee zone companies, sole establishments, and civil companies conducting professional business, including government-owned companies. However, companies in the DIFC and ADGM have their own insolvency provisions and there are no provisions to address individuals acting in a private capacity.</p><p>The bankruptcy law will push up the UAE's Ease of Doing Business ranking (the UAE dropped five places to 104th in the 2017 report under the resolving insolvency category) and specifically assist the SME and entrepreneur segments, which bore the brunt of 2016's liquidity crisis as banks looked to avoid any risky lending at a time when deposits were low. Similarly, it will assist the government's drive for innovation and move through the fourth industrial revolution.</p><p>The new law essentially allows for three potential positive resolutions to insolvency, or impending solvency, for businesses. The parties can make a pre-emptive settlement that will be overseen by the courts, which must occur before the business has actually filed for insolvency. Financial restructuring can take place, whereby a company might renegotiate the terms of the debt and offset some obligations on their books to payback creditors. This must be done within the satisfaction of the majority of creditors holding two-thirds of the outstanding debt and will be overseen by the courts. Additionally, companies may seek additional funding, according to criterion determined by the courts. Debtors who are regulated by either the Central Bank or the Securities and Commodities Authority may look for a settlement that does not require the courts. They can reach out to a newly created body called the Committee of Financial Restructuring (CFR), which can assist their financial restructuring, and which will be overseen by qualified professionals appointed by the CFR.</p><p>Businesses can be filed against for bankruptcy if there has been an outstanding amount of USD27,220 that has remained unpaid for 30 days. A business owner can file for bankruptcy if there has been a cessation of payments on debts, or the company has reached a state of “over-indebtedness,“ while the new law also allows the courts to file for bankruptcy against an owner.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the new law represents a step forward for the UAE's insolvency regime and contains much to be welcomed. The law remains complex and requires insolvency expertise, and many argue that its ultimate success will depend on the availability and ability of local courts and UAE-based insolvency experts to implement and apply the law in real-life cases. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bankruptcy","a-new-rule-book","1515","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-10T12:47:00.000Z","2017-08-10T12:47:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Leveraging Hub Status","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/46b75ff5-1764-4bc1-a1ad-cc79afe548a9.jpg","Leveraging Hub Status","","","","","<p>The proof is in the numbers; according to the World Economic Forum's 2016-2017 Global Competitiveness Report, the UAE overall ranked 16th out of 138 countries with a score of 5.26 out of 7, up from 17 and 5.24 YoY. This sealed its continued dominance of the MENA region. Among the nation's competitive strengths is infrastructure, where it rests proudly in fourth position. More relevant here though, the UAE ranks 28th with a score of 4.72 for financial market development for 2016-17. Other relevant indicators are financial services meeting business needs where it ranks 13th, the affordability of financial services (24th), financing through the local equity market (21st), ease of access to loans (16th), venture capital availability (7th), and lastly the soundness of banks in 17th place—up from 21st place a year earlier.</p><h4>Hub Status</h4><p>Dubai has successfully positioned itself as a major financial hub and as the leading light in terms of sharia-compliant financial dealings. The state-owned financial free-zone Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), launched in 2004, is a vital component in the mix, and aims by 2024 to have welcomed 1,000 financial institutions. Interest has thus far been strong from key markets such as China and India, as well as the Middle East itself; 45% of firms are from Asia and the Middle East. By end-2016, 447 firms had already joined the party, marking a 10% YoY rise. The DIFC not only employs close to 22,000 people, but also boasted a gigantic balance sheet of USD144 billion in 2016.</p><h4>CBUAE: An Overview</h4><p>Dubai's banking universe is overseen and regulated by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), the local Dubai office of which plays intermediary between the Emirate's local banking sector and the Central Bank's head office in the capital of the UAE. As the CBUAE points out, its primary tool is the dollar/dirham spot window providing banks two-way liquidity; that is to say, the ability to exchange USD against AED and vice-versa. In this manner, confidence in the CBUAE, vital to the financial sector, is maintained as the exchange rate is defended and the banks better manage their liquidity in both denominations. According to the Central Bank's 2016 Annual Report, its total assets slipped from USD107,151 million in 2015 to USD99,202 million in 2016. The largest asset on the consolidated balance sheet is held-to-maturity foreign securities, which at USD40,649 million in 2016, nonetheless declined from 2015's USD44,775 million. In a see-saw performance, deposits with the Central Bank rose 25.3% YoY from 76,917 million in 2014 to USD26,229 million in 2015, only to fall to USD16,644 million by year-end 2016. A continued uptrend was observed in cash and bank balances held by the Central Bank, which skyrocketed 87.16% YoY from USD11,433 million at end-2014 to USD21,398 million for 2015 and to USD24,538 million at end-2016. Meanwhile, derivative assets fell hugely during 2015—one of the only balance sheet items to do so—to just USD90.9 million from USD2 billion a year earlier, recovering strongly to USD2.38 billion at end-2016. Gold bullion stood at USD256 million at the close of 2015, rising to USD276 million a year later. The deficit of the UAE's financial account widened by USD21.1 billion in 2016 to USD24.4 billion, comprising 6.6% of GDP; this largely resulted from banking sector activity.</p><h4>Some Regulatory Developments</h4><p>Recent regulatory advances have brought the UAE closer to full compliance with the Basel III liquidity standards by 2018-2019, notably the Liquidity Coverage and Net Stable Funding Ratios. It is noteworthy here that the total CARs of banks were comfortably above the 12% capital adequacy and 8% Tier-1 ratios stipulated by the CBUAE. A new framework identifying Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) is in place. Meanwhile, the new regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) licensed by the Central Bank is also on the way. As the CMUAE notes, the shifting sands and rising sophistication of the financial universe brings with it fresh risks to mitigate through legislation. Related risk assessment takes place at both the systemic and corporate level. For instance, in 2016 new regulations pertaining to crowd funding in the UAE emerged to protect both the individual and the reputation of the financial system itself.</p><h4>UAE Banking Overview</h4><p>As of year-end 2016, a total of 38 licensed foreign banks from 22 countries operated in the UAE as well as 114 foreign bank representative offices. Specifically, 23 local banks operated in the UAE with a total of 1,071 branches, electronic banking units, and pay offices. By end-2016, the total assets of banks in the UAE had climbed 5.4% YoY to USD711 billion fueled by a 6% jump in credit to USD428 billion by end-December 2016. By end-4Q2016, the total deposits of resident and non-resident customers at banks in the UAE had grown 6.2% YoY to USD425 billion. Meanwhile, private-sector deposit growth in 2016 remained largely the preserve of the participation banks, which we will come to shortly. Non-resident deposits in Islamic banks climbed 40.3% in 2016 in stark contrast to the 15% rise among conventional counterparts. Here, the UAE's much-prized stability in a region of woe and seismic politics is working to its advantage as neighboring countries literally bank on its being a safe haven. Banks' specific provisions for NPLs (6.3% of the total) rose to USD21.4 billion at end of 2016 from USD19.7 billion a year earlier, whereby NPLs were fully provisioned. Banks operating in the UAE are highly capitalized, and at end-2016 the CAR and Tier-1 capital of banks saw a three-year peak of 19% for CAR (17.3% for Tier-1 capital), comfortably exceeding the respective regulatory requirements of 12% and 8%. Local banks had an loan-deposit ratio of 102% at end-2016, unchanged YoY, while the foreign institutions' ratio was 92.4%.</p><h4>The Rise and Rise of Islamic Banking</h4><p>The full spectrum of Islamic financial instruments is growing exponentially worldwide, and Dubai prides itself on championing the field. Indeed, Dubai's own Vision 2021 seeks to position the Emirate as the capital of sharia compliance. In 2016, in the 10th annual outing of The Banker's Top Islamic Financial Institutions ranking, the title observed total global sharia-compliant assets of USD1.440 trillion on a CAGR of 12.72%, up from USD386 billion in 2006.</p><p>Official data for the UAE reveals conventional banks to have been better capitalized in 2016 than their Islamic counterparts (CAR of 19.4%, vs. 17.1% and Tier-1 capital 17.5%, vs. 16.5% respectively). Examining conventional and Islamic institutions side by side, we note that the respective L/D ratio is 102% and 96.1% at end-2016, with a YoY decrease for conventional banks, but rise for their sharia-compliant counterparts, whose overall credit grew substantially during the year from the 2015 levels of 103.4% and 92.2%, respectively. Eight banks in the UAE are exclusively sharia compliant, while four conventional institutions operate sharia-compliant windows. Dubai Islamic Bank is the largest wholly sharia-compliant lender in the Emirate, and moreover the third-largest bank overall. Indeed, The Banker survey reveals it to be the world's 20th largest Islamic institution in 2016. In February 2017, it confirmed its board approval for a USD5 billion sukuk program, enabling it to raise funds at its own discretion should the economy become volatile and liquidity become tight given prevailing deflated oil prices. In the same month, the bank listed a USD1 billion sukuk on the Nasdaq Dubai exchange, taking its total issuances there to USD4.25 billion. Islamic bonds were the preferred instrument of the companies, governments, and banks alike in the Arabian Gulf region to the tune of USD60 billion in 2016, to narrow gaps in vital capex needs and to enable lending to boost economic performance. Interest has spread far beyond traditional markets, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ opened its own Islamic finance arm in Dubai in late 2015, having cut its teeth in another vast sharia-compliant market, Malaysia. The bank aims for its Islamic arm to ultimately account for roughly 15% of its credit business in the Middle East from the current 5%, according to its Managing Director &amp; Regional Head for the Middle East, Shichito Tobari.</p><p>Emirates NBD arose in 2007 upon the merger of Emirates Bank International and the National Bank of Dubai, and is the UAE's largest lender and the Emirate's biggest bank by assets. A much-awarded institution, in 2016 for the second consecutive year it was named “Bank of the Year“ in the UAE by The Banker, acknowledging a robust financial profile and frontrunner approach to the digitalization of banking according to the bank. Select metrics for 2016 indicate total assets of USD122 billion, up 10% YoY, albeit accompanied by a net interest income decline of 1% YoY as a margin contraction offset asset growth. Net profit of USD2 billion was up 2% YoY, while customer loans of USD79 billion saw a 7% YoY climb and customer deposits of USD84.6 billion marked an 8% rise from end-2015. The big news in Dubai's capital markets in March 2017 was the start to the UAE's IPO activity for the year, as Emirates NBD's real estate investment trust, ENBD REIT, was strongly oversubscribed ahead of listing on the Nasdaq Dubai. It offered 94,594,595 ordinary shares at USD1.11/share, whereby the stock rose 5.17% to USD1.17/share. Mashreqbank, another major name, is looking to expand its international footprint in key markets such as China, India, and Egypt in diversifying its source of income away from the oil-dependent Arabian Gulf. The bank targets this business delivering 30% of operating income (USD1.7 billion in total for 2016) from the current 24%. For 2016 it held total assets of USD33.4 billion, up 6.6% YoY. Loans and advances rose 1.4% to USD16.6 billion fueled by a whopping 14.4% growth in Islamic finance. The liquid-assets-to-total-assets ratio was at 30.4%, and the loan-to total-assets ratio of 49.7% was down from 52.3% at end-2015. Customer deposits rose 4.6% YoY to USD21 billion. For the year, the bank printed a net profit of USD 517 million. An innovator in the retail banking segment, Mashreqbank, in 4Q2016 introduced the UAE's First “Mashreq Bot,“ a futuristic AI chat-bot that simulates human interaction while explaining bank products to customers.</p><p>Dubai remains a financial hub to be reckoned with, and, moreover, slightly higher anticipated growth of c.3.4% in 2017 will be fueled by higher investment in the approaching Expo 2020, all reflected at the bank. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/04162384-01ca-4f6b-8526-801c057c59c2.jpg","","","","","","Banking","leveraging-hub-status","1607","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-09T10:31:00.000Z","2017-08-09T10:31:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Hello, Mr. Bond","<p>2016 marks the largest collective history of bond and sukuk issuance in GCC history. Tipping the scales at USD66.5 billion, this outstripped 2009's USD60.9 billion, which was almost double the next largest annual total. Bond issuances alone accounted for USD60.8 billion of 2016's total, and just as in 2009 when the property market collapsed and the financial crisis was at its peak, the activity of 2016 was nothing more than a reaction to the drop in commodity prices. The sovereign bonds accounted for 69% of total issuances, with the banks making up 15%.Ü</p><p>The GCC witnessed Saudi Arabia's first sovereign bond issuance, an eye-watering USD17.5 billion package, as the Kingdom looked to plug a budget deficit that had shrunk marginally to USD79 billion in 2016. Abu Dhabi made its first move in seven years with a USD5 billion issuance, Qatar then issued a record USD9 billion in May, and Oman went to the market for USD2.5 billion. Independent of fixed-income securities, Egypt received a USD12 billion loan from the IMF, which came with a package of fiscal reforms, including the long-anticipated devaluation of the Egyptian pound.</p><p>This in turn raises a potential sticking point; with the dollar continuing to strengthen against global currencies, the Emirati dirham's peg could work against the country when it comes to repaying the issuances. The local inflation of the dirham operates independently of the dollar and, as any peg does, creates an artificial value to the pegged currency. While the same number of dirhams created will be required to pay the value of the issuance, the economy has to work harder to earn that number of dirhams. In essence, an investment that will come from the bond issuance will only generate the same number of dirhams, but have to pay off a stronger dollar and the dollar-denominated interest. The same principle applies to all the regional currencies, which are in one form or another linked to the dollar.</p><p>Other issues that surround the bond issuance of the Gulf nations is the negative outlook that credit rating agencies have placed on the region. The UAE is no exception. May 2016 saw Moody's confirm the Aa2 long-term issuer rating but assigned a negative outlook; the long- and short-term currency bond and deposit ceilings retained their Aa2 and Prime-1, respectively. The danger of this is that borrowing becomes more expensive for state-owned companies, such as banks, utility companies, ports, and airports, of which the credit ratings are directly linked to the sovereigns. This could compound issues of a liquidity shortfall, making it more expensive for these privately operating but government-owned companies to raise their own capital. S&amp;P downgraded Sharjah's outlook to negative in August 2016, and then dropped its credit rating in January 2017. This could cause worry as the main reason cited was the increase in the debt burden, while also serving as an unkindly reminder of how fortune can change with the rating agencies.</p><p>On a positive note, investor appetite for sovereign paper remains strong. The equity markets made similar returns but traded within a range of 20%, almost triple what can typically be expected for the bonds. Abu Dhabi's USD5 billion issuance received 600 orders totalling USD17 billion. The five and 10-year tranches were priced at 85 and 100bps, respectively. The sovereigns also benefit from the low interest rate environment, as it provides a cheap option for raising liquidity.<br></p><p>In this case, the metaphor of fixing the roof while the sun is shining has been implemented too literally in the Gulf, and the sovereigns re-decked the patio and employed an extra gardener to water the plants on the weekends whilst oil revenues were high. A sizeable share of the calamity caused by the severity of the decrease in hydrocarbon revenues was compounded by the fact that regional governments had not been particularly prudent. The UAE's slice of the OPEC production cap will at least have been incorporated into budget plans, and should the sovereigns need to raise capital, it will be part of a wider sense of prudence during rainy days. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bonds","hello-mr-bond","1454","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-08-09T09:05:00.000Z","2017-08-09T09:05:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Great Push","<p>Dubai's rapid evolution into a hugely diversified economy and global trade, manufacturing, tourism, and financial hub is almost vertiginous. It has thrived on regulation, flexible response to prevailing and likely circumstances, and systematic innovation. The steps taken to achieve this, and the economic rewards of being an oasis of stability in a frenetic region, continue to pay dividends. For example, to ramp up efficiency, Dubai's economic team will provide twice-yearly updates on its economic outlook in January and October. And meanwhile, an economic team spanning all 13 of the Emirate's government departments will serve as an early warning mechanism. Eminently logical, too, is state support of science and technology, and an educated population to fuel economic diversification into significant industries, which preceded oil troughing at USD30 per barrel. Dubai's private sector is also supported by dedicated facilities conducive to local competitiveness and the attraction of foreign interest alike.</p><p>Incidentally, one gauge of innovation is the number of licenses issued to new businesses through the Intilaq Program, which assists Emirati residents in Dubai to enter the entrepreneurial start-up arena for the vital first three years. The license, costing a modest USD289, allows holders to pursue more than one activity related to the core business, thus encouraging good ideas that as yet lack capital. In 2015, the number had risen to 334 from 293 YoY, and from 226 in 2013, according to the Dubai Statistics Center.</p><h4>An Impressive Performance</h4><p>Dubai's economy grew 2.7% in real terms in 2016 in spite of weak oil and dented global trade, albeit down from the previous year's 4% print. Non-oil sectors are earmarked  to contribute a full 80% of GDP over the coming 15 years. Official projections for growth this year are at 3.1%, fueled by the Emirate's vibrant investment appeal, plus ongoing infrastructure commitments, while the IMF last year forecast growth of 3.6% for Dubai. Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) notes that the UAE overall accounted for an estimated 35% of projects in the GCC from 2006 to 2015, at a total of USD507 billion. In May of this year, subsequent to OPEC's nine-month production cut move, Moody's upgraded its credit-worthiness outlook for the UAE, based, too, on resilience to shocks due to diversification. For the nation overall, it forecasts 1.7% GDP growth, while the government deficit declines to a healthy 1.9%. The retail sector was somewhat buffeted by inflation and consumer sentiment in 2016. Yet, consumer prices in the UAE climbed 2.2% YoY in April of 2017, following March's 3% rise. Encouragingly, this was the lowest print since December 2016, as price rises decelerated for housing and utilities (1.6% from 1.7% in March) and transport (6.6% from 14%). Food inflation fell further (-0.5% from -0.4%). In the UAE, inflation has averaged at 2.19% from 1990 to 2017, peaking at 12.3% in December 2008 and troughing at -0.4% in October 2009.</p><h4>FDI, Global Reach...</h4><p>Dubai's ready adoption of free market policy has entailed the swift development of a stable and well-regulated financial services sector to underpin broader economic activity in trade, manufacturing, and services. This has encouraged the arrival of global businesses and the FDI all-important for GDP growth. In 2016 FDI amounted to USD6.9 billion, maintaining Dubai's ranking in seventh place among the top-10 global recipients. The Emirate furthermore attracted 247 new investment projects, ranking third behind London and Singapore for the year, according to the Dubai Investment Development Agency (Dubai FDI). HE Hani Al Hamli, Secretary General of the Dubai Economic Council (DEC), explained the Emirate's global significance with reference to China and the new Silk Road project. “Dubai has established itself as one of the main transit points for expanding the Gulf commercial dealings with Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Western Europe,"" and “is considered a logistic hub for China because of its geographic location and the strength of its infrastructure."" </p><p>Meanwhile, fiscal and monetary policy focuses on job creation  and price stabilization in pursuit of sustainable growth. This has been supportive by creating conditions for further government spending on the transport, energy, telecommunications, and tourism infrastructure essential for diversification, as well as key sectors such as aviation, prime for export, again in turn GDP growth accretive in nature. In addition, Dubai, or “Dubs"" as British tourists affectionately refer to it, has gained a reputation as a year-round tourism and events destination, soon to attract 20 million annual visitors.</p><h4>...and Expo 2020</h4><p>A key reward reaped by Dubai in 2013 was winning the right to host Expo 2020, a first for the Middle East. And while prestige was immediate, its slow-burn economic benefit is an ultimate USD38 billion contribution to GDP from related activities. Around 277,000 new jobs are estimated, too, while an infrastructure spend of USD6.8 billion underlines long-term state commitment. Anticipating huge rises in arrivals, in mid-2016 the government launched an USD9.54 exit tax on all passengers leaving Dubai by air, which, incorporated into air ticket prices, was estimated to raise an additional annual USD381 million in revenues, in part toward the cost of Expo 2020 infrastructure.</p><h4>2017 Budget Highlights</h4><p>The government of Dubai targets growth through spending and job creation, as evidenced in the USD12.9 billion innovation-oriented 2017 budget. Reflecting the Dubai Strategic Plan 2021, it envisions a 27% rise in infrastructure spend (17% of total budget). The official deficit forecast of USD680 million, at 0.6% of Dubai's total GDP, explains this rise. A full 34% of total spending is dedicated to the social development sector, encompassing health, education, housing, and community development. Compulsory private health insurance, made obligatory for foreign residents in mid-2016, may yet enable savings in the healthcare component going forward. Oil revenue is projected to represent 6% of total government revenue, with government fees at 76% and 16% coming from tax and customs.</p><h4>Supportive Legislation</h4><p>Diverse legislation supportive of growth and diversification at the federal UAE level includes the introduction of a new national labor code as of January 1, 2016. The objectives were greater flexibility, transparency, and most importantly, freedom of movement for foreign workers, while facilitating the acquisition of new work permits. Small wonder then, that in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business for 2016, the UAE ranked 31st out of 189 economies, rising one place on 2015, while for the third consecutive year ranking first in the MENA region for doing business. In a first, the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) is to introduce a VAT of 5% across the UAE as of January 2018. Meanwhile, Dubai has announced a selective tax of 100% on tobacco and energy drinks, and 50% on carbonated drinks scheduled for 4Q2017 in contribution to the post-oil era. Dubai Law No. 22 of 2015 regulates public-private partnerships to ensure that quality and efficient public services or infrastructure-related services arise cost-effectively. What's more, HE Hani Al Hamli stated, through PPPs, “the granting agencies can transfer significant risks to the private-sector partner (resulting in) cost-saving and greater efficiency."" This, he concluded was “especially relevant in terms of unsolicited proposals (where) private entities (can) propose projects directly to government entities, bypassing the tender process.""</p><h4>Special Economic Zones (SEZs) </h4><p>Fundamental to the economy is Dubai's pioneering policy of free trade zones—essentially sector-specific tax-free havens. It boasts 22 free zones, or SEZs, where minimal bureaucracy enables large firms and SMEs' ease of business. The government-regulated Free Zone Authority (FZA) oversees and manages the entities across the country (in total 20,000 companies are registered in 41 FTZs across the UAE). The thinking has been that allocating a dedicated zone to each specific sector fosters synergies. Established in 1985, Jebel Ali was the Middle East's pioneering zone of its kind. Today the largest, it primarily accommodates logistics and shipping companies, and features over 6,000 companies, including 800 from India. Elsewhere, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) operates its own judicial system based on English Common Law. In fact, a highlight for DIFC in 2016 was the transfer of the HSBC Bank Middle East Limited (HBME) head office from Jersey to the DIFC, whereby it is now regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). The DIFC also became one of the founding members of the Global Blockchain Council, established with the Dubai Museum of the Future Foundation to encourage innovation and promote the UAE as key knowledge economy. Other zones of note are the Dubai Airport Free Zone, with 1,300 companies; Dubai Media City, with 1,200 companies; and Dubai Internet City, with just over 1,000 companies as of 1Q2016. In terms of total direct foreign trade for 2016, Dubai's imports were at USD146 billion, with exports of USD35 billion and re-exports of USD45 billion.<br>Ahmad Bin Byat, Director General of the Dubai Creative Clusters Authority (DCCA), established 15 years ago, explained that, to date, the organization's knowledge and academic clusters “have attracted 2,600 international students, (making for a pool of talent attractive for) the 4,5000 companies that operate in our special economic zones.""</p><h4>SMEs and Long-term Thinking</h4><p>It says something about local government policy that, while globally 80% of SMEs go to the wall, in Dubai the figure is roughly 65%. Today the Emirate is home to around 350,000 SMEs, and HE Abdul Baset Al Janahi, the CEO of Dubai SME, pointed to the new bankruptcy law as spurring the ecosystem “for both the lenders and the borrowers (as) both sides will undergo a major restructuring of how they operate."" In short, the law will oblige rigorous financial planning from firms and scrutiny from financial institutions situation, with “a positive effect on the economy and entrepreneurship as people will be less afraid to fail.""</p><p>Dubai is working to become a fully digital community where high-tech solutions enable better government-public interaction and industrial innovation. The 2017 budget has dedicated 8% to championing the so-called excellence, innovation, and creativity sectors in step with the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030. The latter promotes the competitive transformation into “an international hub for knowledge-based, innovation, and sustainable industrial activities."" Dubai, then, can look forward to a vibrant future, having covered all its economic bases.</p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/7f25aa3d-c8ec-4d33-b109-bb6fe9929a01.jpg","","","","A diversified economy and commitment to education and innovation has seen Dubai scale heights unimaginable mere decades ago.","","","the-great-push","1601","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And meanwhile, the clock ticks toward the momentous hosting of Expo 2020, a stellar achievement befitting the objectives of Dubai's wide-reaching industrial Visions 2021 and 2030. The Emirate's history is one of dynamic international relations and sheer commercial agility, akin to that of the national animal, the Arabian Oryx. Small wonder then that the Emirate is seen as a diplomatic stalwart and a champion of diversity and tolerance that has ensured its unshakable stability in a region of seismic political realities.</p><h4>The Government</h4><p>The UAE was established as a federation of seven constitutional monarchies, or Emirates, back in 1971. In 2006, the reins of power were assumed by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Ruler of Dubai who also serves as Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE. And while Dubai's independence came in 1971, the Al Maktoum family's rule stretches back to 1833. HH Sheikh Mohammed is also on the board of the UAE's Supreme Council, the country's highest executive body, and governs Dubai's local administration, the Dubai Municipality. The Dubai Municipality, responsible for overseeing the city's transport, housing, and development, was established in 1954 by the late Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum.<br>The latest parliamentary elections took place in October 2015, wherein 330 candidates contested the 20 elected seats of the Federal National Council (of the 40 seats in total, 20 are appointed). The National Election Committee was established in 2011 to oversee the process. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are the only two of the UAE's seven Emirates that hold the power of veto.<br>In February 2016, HH Sheikh Mohammed announced a cabinet reshuffle, a rare occasion in and of itself. Today there are 29 ministers, including a new Minister for Happiness, Minister for Youth Affairs, and  Minister for Climate Change and the Environment. The average age of the new ministers is 38, and notably, of the eight new ministers five are women.</p><h4>Expo 2020</h4><p>At a staggering 828m in height, Dubai's Burj Khalifa remains the world's tallest building. And yet the meteoric rise of the young and vibrant Emirate of Dubai is best exemplified by its forthcoming hosting of Expo2020, a privilege it won back in 2013, becoming the first nation in the Middle East to do so. The event, scheduled to run from October 20, 2020 to April 10, 2021, not only brings national prestige, but moreover acts as an economic springboard as official data at the time of winning forecast an ultimate USD38.1 billion contribution to GDP from related activities. Around 277,000 new jobs are forecast to be created by the event. Meanwhile, an infrastructure commitment of USD6.8 billion is testament to long-term economic confidence. Of the estimated 25 million visitors, 70% will arrive from overseas to relish the event and the rich offerings of the Emirate itself. By that year, too, annual tourism arrivals are set to reach 20 million. These visitors, as well as residents, will benefit, perhaps unawares, from another advance emblematic of Dubai's technological prowess. A new USD91.2 million Enterprise Command and Control Centre (EC3) is to come online in time to handle the additional arrivals for Expo 2020. Inaugurated by the UAE's Vice President and Prime Minister and Dubai's ruler HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the smart traffic center is capable of overseeing the Dubai Metro, Dubai Tram, and public buses and taxis, as well as marine transit and traffic control systems, and will be the responsibility of the Roads and Transport Authority.</p><p>Expo 2020 embraces the themes of sustainability, mobility, and opportunity under the banner of “Connecting minds, creating the future.“ Its principle site will be a 438ha location mid-way between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, to the south of Dubai, and close to the Emirate's enormously significant port of Jebel Ali.</p><p>Dubai, though, is no stranger to hosting internationally significant conferences, summits, and fairs on crucial academic themes and political and commercial opportunities. Notable among these is the World Government Summit, held every year in Dubai, the fifth edition of which is in February 2017. The organization is a fertile publisher of research on key topics of significance for tomorrow's world, such as sustainability and the digital environment. This year's outing will see over 90 prominent speakers, who apart from HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler Of Dubai, include the IMF's Christine Lagarde and high-tech visionary Elon Musk. These distinguished individuals will address more than 4,000 attendees from around 140 participating nations.</p><h4>Foreign Relations</h4><p>The most populous city in the UAE, Dubai is also the most culturally significant. Indeed, its multiculturalism is evident in its wide spectrum of resident nationalities, not to mention the array of foreign visitors. It is not surprising that in 2002 Dubai became the first Emirate to permit foreign ownership of property. And being one of the leading regional financial hubs underpins the Emirate's durability and economic growth. The UAE is also a central character in regional and international affairs. It is a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Arab League, and a member of OPEC, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the UN.</p><p>As with other regional nations, food security is a notable concern for the UAE, and imports from Latin American nations confirm solid bilateral relations. To boost commercial traffic, the elimination of double-taxation has been explored with a number of nations. As Paraguay's Minister of Industry and Commerce Gustavo Leite told TBY, ""It would stimulate investment and in turn trade."" Meanwhile, in terms of extending the commercial footprint by leveraging both nations' hub status to access new markets, the Vice President of Uruguay Raúl Fernando Sendic Rodriguez notes that there are, ""...many similarities between both countries; for example, we have a similar geographic size and location in relation to our respective regions and we both complement the wider economies around us."" Costa Rica's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship, Manuel Antonio González Sanz intends for his nation, ""...to be the UAE's main partner in Central America and the Caribbean."" A veteran in terms of renewable energy, Costa Rica is, ""...an eco-friendly country producing 99% of its electricity from renewable sources (...) a valuable experience that we can share with other countries."" In exchange Costa Rica seeks to become a knowledge-driven economy, and to benefit from Dubai's advanced moves toward achieving the same goal.</p><p>Ever the vanguard of innovation, Dubai has become the first city to have a font named after it. The “Dubai Font,“ launched under the “Express You“ slogan, is available in 23 languages, and thus symbolic of the Emirate's international spirit and digital ambitions.</p><h4>The Humanitarian Imperative</h4><p>The UAE overall is one of the world's greatest donors of humanitarian aid through programs that benefit recipients in around 140 nations worldwide. The foreign aid budget accounts for 1.33% of the country's total gross national income. The leading recipients of UAE aid between 1971 and 2015 were Egypt (total to 2015 AED47.26 million), Syria (AED12.35 billion), Morocco (AED12.25 billion), Jordan (AED11.48 billion), and Palestine (AED7.68 billion). The International Humanitarian City (IHC) was established in 2003 by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum to support infrastructure projects, relieve poverty, and assist refugees and victims of natural and humanitarian disasters. Meanwhile, the annual Dubai International Humanitarian Aid and Development (DIHAD) Conference and Exhibition is now in its 15th year. Back in 2015, the UAE sent a mission to Nepal to lead relief efforts in Kathmandu following that April's calamitous earthquake. And over the previous decade, similar assistance has been extended to Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, whereby the nation is recognized for its expertise in post-earthquake recovery operations. Also in Pakistan, in a bid to eradicate the lingering blight of polio, the UAE vaccinated 86 million children there in 2015-16. That nation had also received a total aid program of USD318 billion in the wake of widespread flooding in 2010. Notably, too, in 2014 the UAE pledged USD200 million in grants to assist the redevelopment of Gaza. And since 2011 Dubai has been particularly concerned with persistent instability in Syria and Yemen, having been a key player in relief efforts in the latter nation. In 2016, the UAE led the relief effort in the southern Yemeni port city of Mukalla, where it drove out Al Qaeda insurgents and then assisted in the reconstruction of homes and infrastructure. And in response to a UN appeal for USD2.1 billion to deliver urgent food and relief materials, the nation established an aerial and marine relief bridge where planes and ships made timely aid deliveries. Humanitarian assistance included food aid of 172,000 tons and over 111 tons of medical supplies, as well as ambulances; this in addition to the daily delivery of 235.8 tons of food. In fact, overall assistance extended to Yemen between April 2015 and March 2017 reached USD2 billion. Yet assistance has stretched far beyond immediate aid to encompass permanent relief. Infrastructure development has included construction and renovation of key facilities ranging from energy and communications networks to dams hospitals and schools. Conflict had crippled Yemen's transport infrastructure, placing a further burden on reconstruction efforts. In response, the UAE gave USD146 million worth of civil transport, as well as water and fuel transport vehicles in Aden, Marib, Hadramaut, Al-Mahra, and Socotra Island. It also reconstructed Aden airport and Socotra Island port. And meanwhile, in a bid to get the wheels of the Yemeni state turning, funds of USD716 million, 36% of the UAE's total assistance, covered key budget items including the salary payment of civil servants.<br>On December 2, 2017 Dubai will celebrate its National Day, a joyous occasion of pomp and spectacle that will serve to crown another year of achievement for the hugely ambitious Emirate. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/c1c7c2e7-948a-46ac-870c-4b9c7267b077.jpg","","","","","","","a-font-of-achievement","1610","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Middle East > UAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past decade, countries in Latin America have been receiving fixed-capital investment from the UAE in an attempt to develop connectivity.<br>At the same time, Latin American countries are increasingly courting the UAE as a market for its consumer goods. In fact, Brazil is the main commercial partner of the UAE, with the country representing 67% of total trade with Latin-American countries; the import of sugar cane from Brazil was worth a total USD1.9 billion in 2015. In light of the Emirates' ability to maintain its commercial attractiveness in spite of hefty oil price slumps, Dubai stands as a secure business destination.</p><p>The UAE's non-oil trade with the region was USD2.5 billion in 2016, according to Dubai Customs. Comparatively, trade with Asia accounted for USD159 billion and North America dwarfed that figure with USD19.9 billion.</p><p>The relatively high levels of collaboration and the proliferation of free trade agreements among South American states is one of the draws. Likewise, the level of infrastructure is another attraction. The Paraguay-Paraná inland waterway, for example, connects landlocked Paraguay to the Amazonian parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and Uruguay. Currently, the waterway sees around 20 million tons of traffic a year. Seeing as the region is producing so much of the food and other products that are consumed in the UAE, the potential to explore trade opportunities is being realized.</p><p>DP World has seen the potential to develop the logistics sector in South America, and the company now operates ports in Peru, Argentina, and Brazil. The middle of 2016 saw DP world pen a deal for a 50-year concession in Ecuador, the total USD1 billion investment will develop the greenfield port at Posorja primarily for container volumes, and intends to reach a capacity of 750,000TEU per annum in 2019. Brick and mortar investments do not scare Dubai's leading public and private companies, who have a long history in greenfield projects across the globe. Ultimately, Dubai's plethora of investors need destinations for their capital.<br>Dubai's carrier, Emirates, already has non-stop flights to Argentina and Brazil but has postponed plans to establish a direct flight to Panama, originally scheduled for February 1, 2016. The feat would have been a record of 17 hours and 35 minutes flying time. The trip would have been a total 8,590 miles, using Boeing's 777-200LR, the longest-range jet.</p><p>Investing in connectivity and logistics infrastructure benefits the UAE by shortening the time it takes for South American goods to reach the Emirates. For example, an Emirate's flight to South America would be able to carry 15 tons of goods per trip, a conservative three flights a week would add almost 2,500 tons capacity per annum. The UAE imports the majority of its food, and in 2016 imported 33.74 million tons of food products. In 2016, a total of 351,000 shipments made it to the UAE via land, sea, and air—and less than 8,000 of these were for reshipment.</p><p>The desire for partnerships are not just about securing food imports, but also about sharing knowledge. Costa Rica, for example, produces 99% of its energy consumption through renewable resources. The UAE, in its campaign for a knowledge-driven economy is keen to enter into expertise sharing partnerships to help cultivate a more sustainable economic infrastructure. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Connectivity is key to facilitating trade, and the sizable potential for trade with Latin America has justified investment in logistics from the UAE.

With the right factors in place, Southeast Asia's largest economy will continue to be a star performer in the coming years.</p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/6a30c4f4-7609-401c-b5ea-217797f6e00a.png","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/headerImages/2a652875-13f8-4ffa-83ca-5743a336ec10.jpg","","Asian powerhouse Indonesia continues to register strong growth, emerging as one of the region's top performers in 2016, with 5% growth that is set to jump to 5.2% in 2017 and beyond.","","5.6% growth expected in 2017","the-business-year","2289","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Asia > Indonesia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T13:11:00.000Z","2017-07-11T13:11:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Not So  Risky Business","<p>Zambia has experienced steady economic growth since its independence in 1964. The country has benefited from sensible macroeconomic management, economic liberalization, and buoyant copper exports to achieve average growth of 6.4% over the last decade, albeit stumbling recently due to falling commodity prices. That said, the country's reputation for peace and stability amidst other conflict-ridded nations in the region has been a major factor in attracting investment. The World Bank ranks Zambia 105th out of 190 nations in terms of the ease of starting a business in 2017, behind Rwanda (76th) although ahead of Lesotho (117th), South Africa (131st), Angola (144th), Botswana (153rd), and Namibia (170th).</p><p>There are a set of procedures and legal steps that companies need to follow to set up a new business. The World Bank notes that starting a business in Zambia requires seven procedures, takes 8.5 days, and costs 33.7% of income per capita. The registration of companies is governed by the Companies Act 1994 and is carried out at the Patents and Companies Registration Office (PACRA). Foreign companies are not required to enter into partnership with locals to register a company and there are two types of companies that can be incorporated in Zambia: private limited companies and public limited companies. Private limited companies fall into three categories: company limited by shares, company limited by guarantee, and an unlimited company. A company limited by shares is typically for the purposes of conducting business driven by profit, is limited to 50 shareholders, and requires a minimum required capital of ZMK5 million. A company limited by guarantee is typically set up to provide assistance and include foundations and trusts and is not permitted to conduct business for the purpose of making a profit. Lastly, an unlimited company has share capital, though its members have unlimited liability for the company's debts and other liabilities. A public limited company requires a minimum capital of ZMK50 million and can apply to list its shares on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE).</p><p>The list of procedures to register a company include checking the company name for uniqueness at the PACRA; having a Commissioner of Oaths sign the Companies Form 11 (a declaration of compliance); registering the company with the registrar at PACRA; obtaining a taxpayer's tax number from the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA); registering for Social Security with the National Pensions Scheme Authority; paying a business levy with the city council; and registering for VAT with the ZRA. Many of the steps needed to start a business were eased or eliminated in the last several years to streamline procedures and increase the number of registered businesses.</p><p>The system of taxation in Zambia is one that is source-based and every individual receiving income from a source within or deemed to be within Zambia is liable to be taxed on that income. The ZRA is the body that administers the tax system and the tax year for both individuals and companies currently runs from January 1 to December 31 in Zambia. Income tax is divided into PAYE, tax on self-employed individuals, and company tax. PAYE is collected from individuals with formal jobs and employers deduct the tax from an employee's wages and remit it to the ZRA. The PAYE exempt threshold was increased in 2017 from ZMK3,000 a month to ZMK3,300, while the income bands and the top marginal tax rate was increased from 35% to 37.5% for those earning above ZMK6,200. Company tax is levied on business profits of incorporated companies and branches of foreign companies. Taxpayers are required to compute taxable income on an actual basis by reference to the charge year. Companies that are newly listed on the LuSE are eligible for a 2% tax reduction the above income tax rate applicable and a further 5% reduction where Zambians hold at least 33% of the shares. Companies operating in priority sectors designated by the Zambia Development Agency are exempted from income tax for the first five years, 50% between years six and eight, and 25% between years nine and 10. Their dividends are also exempted from tax for five years starting from the date of commencing operations, and imports of capital equipment and machinery face zero import duties for five years. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Doing Business","not-so-risky-business","1700","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T13:08:00.000Z","2017-07-11T13:08:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Adventure Capital","<p>The extreme tourism industry, loosely defined as travel to engage in physically risky sports or other activities that might take one “out of their comfort zone,“ is expected to grow by 45.99% by 2020. Some of the most popular pastimes include sky-diving, bungee jumping, whitewater rafting, gorge walking, and mountain biking, and while Europe dominates the adventure travel market, attracting more than 40% of the total market share in 2016, emerging regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa are stepping up their game.</p><p>Zambia, specifically the Zambezi river basin, affords the desired aesthetic backdrops, natural infrastructure, and accompanying wildlife for potential extreme tourists. The infamous bungee jump over the Victoria Falls, ranked one the world's 15 highest, is also one of the cheaper options on the global market, coming in at an average of USD150 per jump. In recent years, scores of adventure activity providers have set up shop in the area, with increased competition lowering costs, and forcing companies to bring inventive new offerings—like lunch with elephants—to the table.</p><p>One adventure operator on the Zambia-Zimbabwe border, Shearwater Adventures, estimates that 14,000 people participated in at least one of its activities—a historic bridge tour, a bridge slide, a bridge swing, or a bungee jump—in 2016. Currently, the Victoria Falls attract on average 350,000 tourists per year, with nearly all of these guests partaking in some form of adventure tourism. Shearwater estimates the extreme tourism market in the Livingstone region to be worth USD5 million per year.</p><p>However, according to Daan Brink, Managing Director of Livingstone's Adventure, another operator from the area, “the potential for extreme adventure activities in the area is enormous, but restricting regulations in an overregulated tourism industry makes developments unattractive to current businesses and new investors alike. The result is that Livingstone has yet to reach its full potential.“</p><p>The Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA) in collaboration with George Washington University, debuted the Adventure Tourism Development Index (ATDI), rating countries on their extreme travel potential, with Zambia coming in fourth in Sub-Saharan Africa after Botswana, Mauritius, and Rwanda, and just above South Africa. In general, however, Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other regions, especially in terms of government backing for sustainability in the industry, entrepreneurship, branding, and tourism infrastructure.</p><p>Zambia could follow the example of regional leader Botswana, which has reported a large drive from both its public and private sectors to expand the sector, with prime offerings in luxury safaris and eco-tourism and a “high value, low impact“ strategy building an elite brand, while still maintaining an emphasis on adventure activities that can be enjoyed at the Kalahari Desert and Okavango Delta.</p><p>The other area Zambia would do well to focus on is its brand, as Felix Chaila, CEO of the Zambian Tourism Agency, notes. “The first thing is to highlight adventure tourism as one of our specialized niches. It is important not to be too generic in the way we package our tourism offerings. On the one hand, there is leisure tourism, which attracts one market and deserves a dedicated marketing strategy; on the other, there is adventure tourism, which is its own entity. We want to promote Livingstone as the adventure capital of southern Africa.“</p><p>Successful branding strategies in countries such as Peru, New Zealand, Kyrgyzstan, and Australia have been instrumental in boosting these countries' respective adventure tourism markets. Nepal's national tourism board is exploiting its world-famous, natural landscapes, with a Naturally Nepal logo that features graphics of snow-topped peaks under the tagline: “Once is not enough.“</p><p>Zambia has much of what is required to become a leader in the world's extreme tourism market, but now needs to begin utilizing its natural resources to its advantage. If the country can harness the potential of the industry, extreme tourism could make a sizeable contribution to overall tourism figures. What is more, extreme tourism is a tried-and-tested method for extending the length of a tourist's stay in the region, in turn increasing GDP flow, employment opportunities, and strengthening the industry in the long term. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Extreme Tourism","adventure-capital","2102","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as tourism becomes an integral part of the government's rhetoric of economic diversification, there has been a push to diversify the sector internally as well. </p><p>At the beginning of 2017, the Ministry of Tourism and Arts and the National Heritage Conservation Commission joined forces to publish a short guide to investment opportunities in Zambia's heritage sites. In a bid to open up tourism in Zambia, the government has deliberately refrained from featuring the mighty “Mosi-oa-Tunya,“ and is instead profiling certain little known, but equally beautiful, waterfalls in the Northern and Central provinces.</p><p>As one of the most water-rich countries on the continent, Zambia's rolling landscapes are criss-crossed with rivers, streams, and tributaries, many of which tumble over rock formations to produce spectacular sights. However, a combination of factors has kept these waterfalls off the tourist map: namely, a lack of hospitality and heritage infrastructure, poor connectivity between sites, and insufficient marketing, hence the call from the government for foreign investors to tap the rich potential of these natural hotspots. As the Minister of Tourism and Arts, the Hon. Charles Romel Banda, explained: “In an environment of stiff international competition for countries to be the destination of choice for tourists' dollars, collaboration between the government and the private sector will be crucial to sustain the success of tourism in Zambia.“<br>All that is required from external parties wishing to invest is a sound business plan, proof of finance to cover the project costs, proof of a business background, a certificate of incorporation, and a list of all the proposed shareholders.</p><p>There are several sites up for grabs. Kundalila Falls, located in the Chitambo District, in Central province, boasts a total area of 258.9ha, with 50ha available for development. Attractive features include metamorphic rock formations and easy access via good roads all year round. </p><p>Kalambo Falls, a larger space of 518ha, with 20ha available for development, is Africa's second-highest waterfall and the 12th highest in the world, measuring at 220m. According to the ministry's profile, Kalambo nestles in the midst of several other attractive tourist destinations, including old colonial ruins, iron-age smelting sites, and a forest reserve area. On the border with Tanzania, Kalamba Falls is also within close proximity to Lake Tanganyika. </p><p>Chishimba Falls in the Northern province offers investors value for money, since the site is the nexus of three different waterfalls: the Mutumuna falls, the Kaela Rapids, and the Chishimba main falls. With total area of 777ha, 40 of which are available for development, Chishimba is painted by the ministry as an ideal location for investors due to its proximity to Kasama Airport, its offering of a navigable dam and shear waters perfect for extreme water-based activities, and a ready supply of power and internet connection. </p><p>Other worthwhile attractions include the Nyambwezu Falls, located in the Northwestern province of Zambia, just some 200km south of the town of Solwezi; the Ngonye Falls, another waterfall on the Zambezi not far upstream from Victoria Falls; and Lumangwe Falls, an impressive cascade that stretches over some 100m of rock.</p><p>Realistically, if Zambia were able to develop an alternative waterfall trail, winding its way around several of the country's provinces, it would be able to attract and retain many more tourists in addition to those who fly in for a mere few days to tick the Victoria Falls off their bucket lists. It is unsurprising, then, that Collins Chipote of the National Heritage Conservation Commission concludes the foreword to the investors' guide: “You are welcome to invest in Zambia.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alternative Waterfalls","freefalling","1931","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T12:32:00.000Z","2017-07-10T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Many Rivers  to Cross","<p>Can tourism in Zambia be discussed without due acknowledgement of the terrain's first true visitor, David Livingstone? While tourism authorities have since built attractions and infrastructure that have all but eliminated the risk of death by dysentery, visitors today can see a Zambia much like the one Livingstone saw in the 19th century. The sector has long existed in the country, but remains underdeveloped compared to most of its eight neighbors, which include countries with more developed infrastructure and annual base of visitors, such as Tanzania and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The country's authorities are aware of the relative shortcomings of Zambia's tourism sector compared to the region, but have been working diligently in bringing up the sector. While the Ministry of Tourism maintains a strong focus on attracting the proper and necessary investment for the sector, it has been exerting an increasing amount of effort on three key pursuits: targeting certain visitors, preserving the environment, and preparing a local workforce to take care of it all.</p>
<p>In terms of visitors, Zambia broke the 1 million mark in 2016. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, international tourist arrivals are projected to increase steadily, albeit slowly, over the next decade, with estimates for 2017 standing at 1.13 million tourists, and 2027 at over 2 million. Though numbers are increasing, visitors may not be coming for safaris and rafting adventures; the WTTC reports that approximately 58% of the tourism sector's contribution to GDP for 2016 was accounted for by business travellers.</p>
<p>While the industry's contribution to GDP is growing, there is still considerable space to increase, in comparison to Zambia's regional neighbors. WTTC data shows that the sector's total contribution to GDP in 2016 was ZMK5.2 billion, making up 7% of GDP; the contribution is expected to increase by 4.4% in 2017 to ZMK15.9 billion, without increasing its percentage of GDP. This places the country well below the global average of tourism's total contribution to GDP of 10.2%, including the Sub-Saharan average of 7.1%, as well as neighboring Malawi's 7.2%. Though the numbers are low, they indeed are improving, and, if nothing else, are prompting the government to increase the sector's share three-or-so points, to a comfortable and regionally shared 10%. Zambia is already preparing the foundation.</p>
<p>Following the lead of neighboring countries, and a global trend in easing visa regimes for leisure visitors, the government recently relaxed visa requirements for a score of countries, dropping the price of a 90-day, single-entry visa to USD50 upon arrival. While the industry is still heavily lobbying the government to further reduce prices, or, following the trail of Botswana, Namibia, and the Seychelles, to omit visa fees entirely for tourists from the US and the EU, the country has already been raking in the benefits. Since the reforms have been implemented, alongside the introduction of e-visas, tourist arrivals have increased by 20%. Though lower than UNWTO research that suggests such measures can boost arrivals by 25%, the country is making moves in the right direction.</p>
<p>This momentum comes in light of the WTTC naming Zambia 36th out of 185 countries in terms of long-term growth in tourism. The country still has much work to do, even compared to underperforming neighbors. The country ranks 135 on the same scale in terms of the industry's contribution to GDP for 2017. More promising, however, is the organization's ranking for Zambian tourism growth, which places the country at 94.</p>
<p>Without a coastline, the country must rely on its more earthen attractions to appeal to tourists. Fortunately, its borders have left it territorially gifted, most legendarily with the widest waterfall in the world. Moreover, the country has a great diversity of landscapes. In the very southwest of the country lie the fringes of the Kalahari Desert, while the northeast features lush highlands, where, amid the rolling green hills above the clouds, hikers may come across a dazzle of zebras traversing a hillside. The majority of the country is made of wet and dry grassland, providing an ideal setting for safaris or general outdoor experiences.</p>
<p>The country sees its adventure tourism as the niche with the most potential within the country. However, surrounded by countries with similar landscapes, wildlife, and climates, Zambia has the unique task of differentiating itself and avoid turning into a run-of-the-mill African safari destination. Part of this differentiation includes promoting and further developing infrastructure for two of the country's natural wonders, Victoria Falls and Kalambo Falls, the world's widest waterfall and the second-tallest waterfall in Africa, respectively. The Batoka Gorge, located just below Victoria Falls, is a world-renowned rafting destination taking rafters through a labyrinth of 23 rapids situated between towering black cliffs on either side. As one of the country's most popular destinations, the falls have a range of other attractions that include rappelling, body boarding, and bungee jumping.</p>
<p>Both capitalizing on and preserving the richness and diversity of its wildlife, Zambia has more than 22.4 million ha of land designated as national parks or game management areas. The Kafue, Kasanka, Lower Zambezi, Musi-o-Tunya, and South Luangwa national parks are the most frequented by tourists, but the country's 15 other national parks are ripe for investment aimed at sustainable and adventure tourism investment. Moreover, the country has five major rivers, four major lakes, and more than 20 waterfalls scattered throughout the country. South Luangwa National Park has one of the highest concentrations of wildlife in the world and offers visitors game treks lasting from one to eight days featuring bush camps.</p>
<p>Only 40% of Zambia's population lives in urban areas, with the rest in rural areas and accounting for the country's mix of 73 languages and range of cultural heritage and events. Several distinct festivals are held annually by the nation's various peoples. Perhaps the most popular is the Kuomboka Ceremony, a tradition of the Lozi of Western Zambia; held each year in either March or April to mark the movement of people from floodplains to higher grounds.</p>
<p>Harnessing its cultural heritage, Zambia also has a score of museums. The Moto-Moto Museum in Mbala has a collection of prehistoric artifacts from Northern Zambia, including evidence of the first use of fire by man. Other museums include the Lusaka National Museum, a cultural history museum with exhibits in archaeology, ethnography, and art, and the Livingstone Museum, a visit to which no trip to Zambia could be considered complete without.</p>
<p>In order to increase tourism arrivals, infrastructure improvement throughout the country is a necessity; however, there exist plentiful means of travel into and within Zambia. The country's main airport is Kenneth Kuanda International Airport in Lusaka, and it is quickly becoming a regional hub. While the only intercontinental flight is to Dubai, offered by Emirates, the airport has direct flights to Johannesburg, Harare, Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam, and Luanda. Proflight Zambia is the country's primary airline, with a fleet of 17 operating scheduled and charter flights to 11 destinations. Train is another method of arriving in the country. The TAZAR Railway can carry passengers from Dar es Salaam from neighboring Tanzania to Kapiri Mposhi, about 200km north of Lusaka. The train takes about 38 hours, breaks down regularly, and costs between USD40-55.</p>
<p>Once inside Zambia, transportation within the country is relatively simple, though that should not necessarily suggest comfort or affordability. The country has five airports with regularly scheduled commercial flights, with another 17 dotted throughout. Despite the infrastructure, flights can be expensive, potentially USD150 one way, and infrequent; charter flights are an option, and, with enough people, can offer a competitive alternative to commercial flights. Luxury coaches are prevalent in the country and offer a more timely, and safe, means of transportation.

<p>For the time being, the aspect of Zambia that will continue to attract potential tourists is that the sector, though present, is still marginally less developed than the country's neighbors, leaving its spectacular geographical and wilderness environments uncommercialized, offering visitors some of the most natural cultural and wildlife experiences they can get in Africa.</p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/9a22527f-20ae-4ae0-8297-905a0566ceb6.jpg","","","","","","","many-rivers-to-cross","2238","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Africa > Zambia","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T12:24:00.000Z","2017-07-11T12:24:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Girl Power","<p>In spite of the general consensus that education can be the primary resource for moving the economy forward, there is much still to do to ensure that everyone on the planet has equal access to quality education. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to more than half of all the children in the world who are not enrolled in school: estimates suggest that these nations will have to provide basic education to 444 million children between the ages of 3 and 15 in 2030. Specifically, the lack of education affects one demographic more than another. According to UNESCO, 48% of women in Sub-Saharan Africa are illiterate and recent statistics in Zambia show that girls aged 11-12 drop out of school at more than double the rate of boys; by age 15, this figure increases to more than three times. </p><p>A new initiative called Girls Education and Women Empowerment and Livelihood (GEWEL) by the World Bank and the government is attempting to unravel the complexities of the issue in Zambia and get to the heart of the matter. It has budgeted USD65 million for the five-year long GEWEL project, which will target 75,000 women in 51 districts across all 10 of Zambia's provinces. A cornerstone of GEWEL is Keeping Girls in School (KGS), designed to boost the number of girls staying in secondary and tertiary education. KGS was launched in January 2017, with a budget of USD25 million, and will target 14,000 female pupils at schools across the country, offering school sponsorship and other financial aid. Ina-Marlene Ruthenberg, the World Bank's Country Manager for Zambia, told TBY the project will provide direct financial support in particular for girls and women in rural areas. School fees will be financed on behalf of adolescent girls in households identified as being among the poorest in the country through their participation in the government's existing Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS).  </p><p>This program is a flagship initiative and will be vital for Zambia, a country that is taking the first steps towards acknowledging the important socioeconomic role its female populace can play. Inonge Wina, the President's running mate in the 2016 general election, has entered record books by becoming the country's first ever-female Vice President. She is joined in cabinet by several female peers, including Hon. Dora Siliya, Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Kampamba Mulenga, Minister of Information and Broadcasting Services, and Hon. Victoria Kalima, Minister of Gender. In addition, Zambia is the only country in the world to have introduced a monthly day of paid leave for women, a so-called “mother's day,“ conceived to accommodate women's biological calendars and one that has caused inevitable controversy.</p><p>While the KGS initiative is a step in the right direction, it will, of course, take some time before the fruits of this endeavour can be harvested, particularly with regards to seeing more women in tertiary education and top executive positions. Executive Director of the Zambia Center for Accountancy Studies (ZCAS), Dr Alvert N. Ng'andu, spoke to TBY about the apparent decline in numbers of women in senior management, noting, “At one point, Zambia had several women as CEOs and so on; however, all of a sudden they seem to have disappeared. There is now a sort of void, with hardly any women taking over those roles, as if something had gone wrong with succession planning.“ Yet, according to the Minister of General Education, Dr. Dennis Wanchinga, to tackle this deficit, we need to step back and look at the bigger picture. “There is a high dropout rate for a number of factors, and we want to change this so that women go on to play a more meaningful role in the country's development,“ the minister told TBY.</p><p>Indeed, evidence has shown that better educated women are healthier, more likely to seek employment in the formal sector, earn more income, marry later and have fewer children, and are better equipped to support these children with healthcare and education. Many hopes, therefore, are pinned on the GEWEL program, a positive development that is pointing at those lower down in the education chain, nipping the problem in the bud. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Girls in Education","girl-power","1910","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T12:17:00.000Z","2017-07-11T12:17:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Fast Track","<p><strong></strong>Roughly 60% of the Zambian population is under the age of 25, indicating that the country boasts latent potential in terms of human capital. In 2017, the Ministry of General Education, in partnership with the private sector, is focused on ensuring that the country's youth have access to the resources needed in order to best contribute to the nation's burgeoning economy.</p><p>The percentage of the government's budget allocated toward education in 2015 and 2016 was 20% and 17.5%, respectively, while 2017 will receive approximately 15.5% of the government's funds, or USD960 million. Although a decrease from the previous year, 2017 marks a change in orientation for government-led education spending, toward a “quality over quantity“ approach. To that end, the ministry has identified several areas in which to focus to allow funding to be channeled in a more efficient way.</p><p>In an interview with TBY, Dr. Dennis Musuku Wanchinga, Minister of General Education, said, “We have identified four factors that are important to improve education in Zambia: the teacher factor, the home factor, school infrastructure, and school management.“ With an eye toward increasing the number of highly trained and qualified education professionals employed in the sector, “One of the elements that the ministry will focus on is improving teacher education. We have a number of cooperative partners also working toward improving human resources capacity in education, such as the World Bank and UNICEF,“ he concluded.</p><p>Over the past five years, the government has established over 118 secondary schools around the country, creating over 56,000 classrooms and 2,360 housing units for teachers. In addition, 220 schools were renovated, bringing the total of new classrooms to over 100,000. As part of its 2016-2021 manifesto, the ruling party of Zambia has committed to continue upgrading the remaining 1,800 schools. Laboratory facilities, as well as personal technology such as computers for students and digital teaching and learning materials for educators, are also included in the plan.</p><h4>FIRST STEPS</h4><p>Along with the education strategy for 2016-2021, the government is dedicated to the expansion of elementary and secondary education, committed to delivering quality coursework and developing skills. Up until 2011, early childhood education was dominated by the private sector. The government took action to make early education free for all Zambians up through to grade eight. At the same time, children from the age of three have access to early childhood education, in line with a national policy that enhances access and improves preschool quality. Today, there are a total of 1,526 early childhood education centers, and 70,000 children, many of whom live in rural areas, now have access to education for the first time in Zambia's history.<br>In order to grant wider access and increase quality, the government established community-based education centers in every province of the country. The centers offer teacher training programs, recruitment services, and relocation and deployment systems for existing teachers who are needed in other zones.</p><h4>HIRE EDUCATION</h4><p>Currently, there are approximately 55 institutions in Zambia that are registered as universities, with 19 accredited by government institutions. With the vast majority of universities in the country privately owned and operated, PPPs and FDI could come to play a key role in improving the tertiary education segment and raising standards across the board. </p><p>On the agenda for the Ministry of General Education are more classroom spaces, better human resources, and a shift in mindset surrounding education and its importance. As soon as the government has finished planned improvements in terms of the number and quality of education facilities throughout Zambia, the regulatory body will turn its attention toward improving curricula and coursework content to better suit the changing demands of the local economy, population demographic, and need to create more jobs. At present rates, demand for jobs will outgrow supply over the medium term, and educating a new generation of entrepreneurs to fill the gap is paramount.</p><p>“The Ministry of General Education encourages partnerships with the private sector, in particular for fast-track programs. On these programs, the public and private sectors work together to define certain areas in the system that need particular attention, such as boosting science and technology learning,“ Minister Wanchinga illustrated. The ministry has already formed key partnerships with institutions such as DMI St. Eugene University and the Zambian Open University so that teachers of science and mathematics are hired faster.</p><h4>PRIVATE BUSINESS</h4><p>Thanks in part to a newly launched student loan scheme, an increased number of Zambian students are now able to continue their education at private universities throughout the country. Bearing in mind that the government has yet to implement a system to ensure that student loans are repaid, private operators are aware of the need to create enough graduate jobs. Of Zambia's many tertiary education institutions, the University of Lusaka, the Zambia Centre for Accountancy Studies (ZCAS), and the Livingstone International University of Tourism Excellence and Business Management (LIUTEBM) are three of the most forward thinking.<br>The University of Lusaka boasts internationally accredited programs that attract not only Zambians, but students from overseas. In 2014, the university boasted 4,300 students, a figure that has risen to 6,500 for the 2016-2017 term. The university also recently established new facilities for its law department, and plans to branch out into the medical field by launching programs in medicine, pharmacy, and nursing. “We have been broadening our portfolio of postgraduate courses, with a new executive MBA program in leadership and wealth creation,“ Professor Pinalo Chifwanakeni, Vice Chancellor of the University of Lusaka, told TBY. The first group was set to graduate in March 2017. This year, the university will also begin the construction of student accommodations at the main campus, slated to begin in April 2017. In line with government-led initiatives, the university is seeking ways to update its curricula and improve its teaching standards to match the needs of the present. To that end, the institution is working to employ not just academics, but also practitioners with hands-on experience to teach its students. “We also place a lot of importance on internships and work experience and training. We want to engage with the industry sector a lot more as a university because this is where our products end up,“ Professor Chifwanakeni concluded.</p><p>Both ZCAS and LIUTEBM are looking to R&amp;D as the next step in taking private education institutions into the future. Whether through forging strong partnerships with technologically advanced and innovative companies, or by funding in-house R&amp;D departments, universities with a focus on research are set to be prime contributors to creating new jobs, inspiring young entrepreneurs, and fostering the establishment of local SMEs. “We have entered into some strategic partnerships, such as with the Zambia Institute for Policy Analysis and Research (ZIPAR) to start building our research capacity.“ Dr Alvert N. Ng'andu, Executive Director of ZCAS, told TBY. LIUTEBM, however, which focuses on ensuring that Zambians are ready to participate in the lucrative tourism sector, is working to make it possible for more research to be carried out locally. “We have an entire department dedicated to consultancy and research services, both for external bodies as well as for our own affiliates as well,“ Patrick K. Kalifungwa, Vice Chancellor of LIUTEBM, explained to TBY in an interview. “This is a significant part of our work, because 20% of our funding is generated through this segment.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Education","fast-track-zambia-2017","1950","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T10:34:00.000Z","2017-07-10T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Get Well","<p>ike many emerging economies, Zambia is aware that a healthy population is the key to boosting productivity and national wealth. In 2017 the government will continue carrying out an aggressive agenda to solidify the healthcare sector under the guiding principles of six key pillars: health services delivery, human resources for health, the health supply chain, information systems, infrastructure and medical equipment, and leadership and governance.</p>
<p>As a signatory of the Abuja Declaration, Zambia is committed to working toward supporting the local healthcare sector with at least 15% of the national budget. So far, Zambia has managed to dedicate 10%, or ZMK5.8 billion, with every intention to keep working toward increasing that amount. While the required amount of financial resources remain difficult to secure, the government has taken action in other areas, specifically in terms of ensuring that there are enough healthcare personnel employed in the country. In 2017, Zambia's Ministry of Health recruited 7,400 healthcare workers and assigned them throughout the country. In 2016, that figure reached just 2,000. Meanwhile, the government has increased the budget for the pharmaceuticals industry, by 30% since 2016.</p>
<h4>PUBLIC LEADERSHIP</h4>
<p>At a macroeconomic level, the Ministry of Health has recognized that there are factors in several sectors that impact the health of the local population. Accordingly, these &ldquo;social determinants"" have come into view as a primary focus for the government as areas to improve before the healthcare sector can reach its true potential. Critically, water, nutrition, education (especially for female students), road infrastructure, household income, housing, and sanitation need to be addressed. &ldquo;Nutrition will solve 60-70% of our health problems,"" Hon. Dr. Chitalu Chilufya, the Minister of Health of Zambia, told TBY. Additionally, sanitation, including access to clean water, is expected to reduce the number of diseases among rural children.<br />With new attention toward preventative care, education, and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, the ministry has shifted the entry point to the health system from hospitals to the home. Now, the government can deliver solutions to communities around Zambia with high-tech drones, e-learning initiatives, and community ambassadors. &ldquo;We want to emphasize that we are making a balanced investment, with plans to boost health promotion, disease prevention, hospital services, rehabilitation services, and curative services,"" Minister Chilufya said. Decentralizing healthcare services from urban areas into various regional hubs has also been carried out to shorten the distances between transporting medicine from central areas and rural communities, simultaneously improving access, solidifying security, and increasing efficiency. The public sector is spearheading a number of innovative training programs, including e-learning and distance learning, in addition to accrediting more hospitals as training institutions. The ministry has worked to accredit 11 existing hospitals, but is also building entirely new facilities. Since 2011, the government has established 14 new hospitals and three new training institutions, expanding infrastructure in a host of other healthcare areas. &ldquo;We invite those who are interested in partnering with us to re-equip and modernize our tertiary institutions,"" Chilufya emphasized. &ldquo;We have backed an innovative and sustainable program to raise money to finance healthcare, with the introduction of a social insurance program for the public sector."" The program has already been approved at the policy level, and is expected to pass in parliament and become elected as law by YE2017.</p>
<h4>PRIVATE AMBITIONS</h4>
<p>Many have already taken up the government and the Ministry of Health on their invitation to do business in Zambia.<br />Fairview Hospital has identified a niche in specialty care, especially surgical oncology, laparoscopy, neurosurgery, and ear, nose, and throat diseases, all of which lack attention from both public and private healthcare providers. The hospital also boasts the most high-tech intensive care units and operating rooms, unique in the private sector. According to Dr. Jabulani Munalula, Medical Director of Fairview Hospital, the company faces stiff competition and is actively expanding in Zambia in response. &ldquo;The Zambian market is becoming much more sophisticated. Because of this, our competition is not just local private hospitals and clinics, but also facilities in India or South Africa,"" he said in an interview with TBY. &ldquo;The growth of the middle-income segment in Zambia has an impact on private healthcare, as we see more individuals with access to us through their employers."" In developing its growth strategy, the hospital has targeted the Copperbelt and Northern Zambia, noting that these areas have been marked by a lack of healthcare services. In 2017, Fairview Hospital is looking at opening up a series of new diagnostic centers around the country. &ldquo;Restricting ourselves to Lusaka with just one center does us a disservice,"" Munalula concluded.</p>
<p>Bringing in advanced medical techniques is one way that the private sector is contributing to Zambia's healthcare system. However, medical equipment and machinery is also in high demand, and the private sector is well positioned to provide it.</p>
<p>Although its main focus is on dialysis-related products, B. Braun produces a variety of equipment for general hospital use, including anesthesia products, wound care tools, and surgical instruments. In addition to providing products for Fairview Hospital, B. Braun services CFB Hospital, Forest Park Hospital, and Italian St. Paul's Hospital in Lusaka. &ldquo;After only a few months of operations, our products have already found their way to many end users,"" Nimrod Njamba, Head of Sales and Marketing in Zambia for B. Braun, told TBY. Apart from providing much-needed hospital products, B. Braun seeks to participate in a knowledge transfer in Zambia. &ldquo;We learn from the doctors here while simultaneously providing our own know-how. We support various Zambian medical organizations and associations by bringing in doctors from across the world to host workshops and seminars,"" Njamba said. Though the company does not manufacture in Zambia, plans to start local production are in the pipeline. &ldquo;We want to have our manufacturing as close as possible. We currently produce in Johannesburg, and it is likely that a similar operation could open in Zambia,"" he concluded.</p>
<h4>PHARMACEUTICALS</h4>
<p>Zambia's pharmaceutical imports have steadily increased since 2010, reaching a value of over USD220 million in 2015. The country's top five sources of medicine were South Africa, India, UK, Denmark, and the US. The Zambian Medicine Regulatory Agency (ZAMRA) enforces the quality of the pharmaceutical products sold in the country and aims to attract investment. Although the country has battled illicit medicine sales for years, new supervisory policies and cooperation with private sector players is expected to curb unauthorized activity and make supply chains more efficient. However, for many, access to pharmacies and essential medicines is limited because the majority of licensed pharmacists are based exclusively in urban areas. Moreover, clinics around the country are frequently undersupplied. The government's efforts to streamline this process by allowing clinics to place orders directly with the central distribution center should result in better access to products nationwide. &ldquo;Our main objective is to bring medical services to the people through shops that will be accredited by ZAMRA officials,"" ZAMRA Director Bernice Mwale told the press in 2016.</p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/f2dccb3f-0c16-4f1e-9249-982dd04aa3a9.jpg","","","","Local authorities agree that improving the healthcare sector through promotion, education, and investment is the first step toward making Zambia a middle-income country by 2030.","","Health","get-well","1991","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Africa > Zambia","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T08:57:00.000Z","2017-07-11T08:57:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Something Fishy Afoot","<p>Everyone knows the proverbial disadvantages of giving a man a fish. However, if teaching a man to fish will feed him for a year, imagine the benefits that boosting a country's aquaculture sub-sector could bring for an entire population. This seems to be the thinking behind the Zambian government's increased drive to channel substantial sums of the national budget into increasing the country's fishery capacity.</p><p>Zambia is among the highest producers of fish in Sub-Saharan Africa, with over 8,500 tons per year. A variety of fish are farmed, including breams, the common carp, crayfish, and, the most common, tilapia. However, despite this notable increase in demand, local fish consumption is currently well below the world average and, indeed, has fallen to half of what it was 20 years ago. This is because wild-capture fishing activity has led to lower yields, increases in unsustainable practices, falling fish stocks, and a subsequent uptick in prices. With fish less affordable than before, figures show that just 7kg of fish is consumed per person per year in Zambia, compared to the average global consumption of 19kg. Efforts are being made to reduce this gap, since fish can be one of the cheapest and most nutritious forms of animal protein. In this context, therefore, the only alternative to cheap fish imports from Asia is aquaculture.</p><p>Shortly after being re-elected, President Lungu reiterated in his inaugural speech the desire to turn the potential of the sector into “commercially viable projects that will uplift our people's nutrition status and incomes,"" calling on government agencies to promote aquaculture parks in high potential zones. At the end of 2016, aquaculture received special mention again, this time in the national budget speech given by Finance Minister Felix Mutati. It was declared that ZMK18.3 million would be dedicated to facilitating aquaculture entrepreneurship, with funding earmarked for training programs for farmers in fish feed production and for the development of fingerling centers in Runfusa, Mungwi, Kasempa, and Chipepo. The government also underscored the need to increase fiscal incentives to enhance private-sector involvement in the industry. Already, several foreign financers have expressed an interest in investing in Zambia's water resources, with commitments to grow long-term strategies for water sector development and related projects coming from both Denmark and the Netherlands.</p><p>Also keen to involve the private sector is the Aquaculture Development Association of Zambia (ADAZ), currently undergoing discussions with the European Investment Bank regarding funding for the recently conceived Zambia Aquaculture Enterprise Development Project (ZAEDP), a USD50.89 million proposal designed by ADAZ in conjunction with the African Development Bank and due to commence in 2017. The Department of Fisheries has selected high potential zones for aquaculture, called fish farming blocks, themselves split up into clusters known as “Aqua-Parks."" The ZAEDP will develop these Aqua-Parks and provide training to those already working in fish farming, as well as those who are new to the industry. Loans will also be offered to allow some of these individuals to invest in the aquaculture value chain. Service centers will be established near these farming blocks to provide extension services and expert advice to these entrepreneurs.</p><p>Other initiatives include the USD1.5 million World Bank funded Chikowa Dam project, as well as a fish farming ban enforced by the Department of Fisheries. The dam will be used not only to provide water resources to communities in the area, but also in irrigation and fish farming. The farming ban prevents fishing in natural waters between December 2016 and end of 1Q2017, allowing wild fish time to complete their breeding cycle and encouraging young farmers to construct fish ponds, increasing numbers of farmed fish exempt from this regulation.</p><p>As the World Fish Center notes, the fisheries industry in emerging markets can be instrumental in securing sustainable futures for individuals not just in terms of nutrition and food security, but also in terms of job creation and increasing a country's foreign exchange. The abovementioned campaigns, projects, and initiatives are testimony of the Zambian government's interest in casting a wide net, keen to capture every practical opportunity available to further its development of the aquaculture sector. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Zambia is looking to boost its aquaculture sector, with an eye on solidfying its position as one of Africa's top producers of fish.","","Aquaculture","something-fishy-afoot","2152","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T08:21:00.000Z","2017-07-11T08:21:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Untangling the Web","<p>The laws surrounding property and ownership of land have significant consequences for a country. Firstly, and most obviously, title deeds can facilitate investment in property and the growth of the real estate market. Also, in terms of the individual, it is a proven trend internationally that land and home owners are more likely to invest their capital, and are also more likely to be granted credit since they can use their property as collateral. Without this right, access to capital to build a business, for example, is difficult to secure. From an administrative point of view, governments can use land surveys and registration systems to properly assess and even collect tax revenue.</p><p>On the whole, Sub-Saharan Africa's land registration systems do not impress. The Quality of Land Administration index shows that the region comes in last. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the average number of procedures necessary to legally acquire land ownership is high, at 6.2, and the process takes an average of 59.7 days to be completed. Compared to its neighbors, Zambia is slightly above the mean, with an average procedure count of 6.0 and a duration of 45 days. </p><p>However, among all the regions, Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for the most land reforms in 2015-16. A total of 28 countries from Southern Africa lowered transfer taxes and over government fees. One of these was Zambia, which decreased property transfer tax from 10 to 5%  in 2016, making it more affordable to transfer property in the country. This was the most positive development in land administration the country has implemented since it computerized its land registry in 2009. Following this example, Guinea also reduced its tax from 10 to 5%, Senegal from 15 to 5%, Chad from 15 to 10%, Cote d'Ivoire from 10 to 4%, and Malawi from 3 to 1.5%.<br>In a conversation with TBY, Managing Director of Knight Frank Zambia, Timothy Ware, revealed that the government was looking at increasing the ability of owners to acquire deeds more quickly. He mentioned a joint project set up between the Ministry of Finance and the Zambia Property Owners Association, which pilots easy access to deeds in Lusaka. </p><p>Greater transparency in land administration via a more clear-cut and straightforward title deed system could aid the authorities in their quest to bring more of the population into a formal, tax-based economy. Benefits would include the facilitation of city planning, with urbanization mapping to provide more efficient services and more relevant infrastructure. Finally, better land management could avoid or minimize the effects of environmental or climate-related risks.</p><p>Granted, the government will lose out on some fiscal revenue owing to the lowered transfer tax, but this measure will guard against informal purchases born of reluctance to register transactions because of high cost. Informal purchases not only weaken the protection of property rights, but reduce overall potential revenue that can be accrued from property taxes. Thus, in all, the lowered tax could prove a key development in Zambia's property regulatory landscape. </p><p>But what further steps need to be taken to ease access to title deeds and therefore facilitate doing business in Zambia? As the World Bank's ratings show, the title deed acquisition procedure in Zambia is still unduly complicated. Additional fees and duties apply throughout the process, increasing levels of unnecessary bureaucracy, dissuading potential investors, and negatively impacting ease of doing business in the country. <br>Some improvements could be to follow in the footsteps of some other African countries that have set up fixed fees for property transfer. A leaf could be taken out of Ghana's book: the Western African country has pioneered one-stop shops to efficiently minimize interactions between agencies and businesspeople for such procedures. Zambia should also consider making the move to become 100% digital. Currently, 61% of the world's economies have property registries recorded on electronic files, and this has been proven to inordinately improve ease of doing business. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Land, land everywhere, but only 200,000 land titles.

"2017-07-11T07:11:00.000Z","2017-07-11T07:11:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Growth takes  flight in Zambia","<p>For several years now, it has widely been acknowledged that the country has been let down by an underdeveloped aviation industry. Lack of airport infrastructure, low human and cargo capacity, and a marked absence of a national airline are all factors holding Zambia back from achieving its potential as a tourism hub and exporting focal point for the Southern African region. However, all that seems to be about to change</p><p>One of the most eye-catching improvements that will put Zambia back on the map is the planned extension to the country's main serving airport, the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA). This expansion, due to be finished in 2019, has been designed so that when seen from above the new builds take the form of an eagle, the trademark symbol of Zambia, which also appears on the country's flag. </p><p>Located 27km away from Lusaka, the KKIA is the largest airport in Zambia. The single 3,963m runway serves as the main entry and exit point for the country's visitors, who numbered 1 million in 2014. The expansion project, which consists of the construction of a brand-new terminal, will increase the airport's capacity to accommodate 6 million travelers. Designed by China Airports Corporation, the new terminal will have a more advanced international arrivals and departures area, as well as new aprons, taxiways, and a control tower, and is expected to cost USD360 million. </p><p>Meanwhile, in the Copperbelt region, the mining heartland of the country, the Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport (SMKIA) in Ndola is struggling to cope with the high level of traffic passing through the area. One of the fastest-growing international airports in Zambia, the SMKIA has no further room for extending runways. Because of this, there are plans in the pipeline to develop a new sister airport to serve the region. Works on what will become the Copperbelt International Airport began in August of 2016 and are expected to be completed by 2019.</p><p>At an estimated cost of USD397 million, the Copperbelt International Airport is meant to soar into the lead as the regional transport center for industry and tourism. With a 1 million-capacity international terminal building, three aero bridges, a large-scale hotel, a business complex, an air cargo terminal, and an airport fuel farm, the project is no small feat for the contractors, China's AVIC International Holding Corporation Limited. The results are expected to have a large impact on the industrial activities at the nearby Chambishi Multi-Facility Economic Zone, where many of the country's cobalt and copper mining companies are based, as well as tourist hotspots of Nsobe Game Reserve and the Chimfunshi Chimpanzee Orphanage. With the planned capacity for 1 million passengers, 8,000 tons of cargo, and 20,000 aircraft take offs and landings per year, it seems the Copperbelt International Airport has been designed with precisely this demand in mind. <br>Elsewhere, Zambia's potential as a high-flyer has caused foreign parties to lend their support. At the end of 2016 the EU awarded Zambia a EUR5.6 million grant to improve regulatory frameworks in the aviation industry. It is hoped that this money will finance programs targeting improved air safety and security oversight systems, ensuring air traffic control conforms with international standards as stipulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), with a final view to enable air carriers registered in Zambia to safely and legally operate in European airspace.</p><p>In conversation with TBY, the Minister of Transport, Hon. Brian Mushimba, pinpointed the necessity of developing aviation infrastructure to bolster business in industry and tourism, revealing the government's plans to build airports in Kasama and Mansa. “We are making changes to policies and regulations and signing certain statutory instruments to unlock and streamline the sector,“ he said. With many of these projects planned to near completion before 2020, there are high hopes all round that Zambia's aviation industry could really take off.  </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AVIATION","growth-takes-flight-in-zambia","2388","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405b","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T06:34:00.000Z","2017-07-10T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","What Is Needed to Build a Basket","<p>The country is made up of 752,614sqkm of land, 60% of which is arable. This grand swathe of growing potential is made even more attractive by the fact that 40% of the water in the sub-region is domiciled in Zambia. For all its potential, the sector is underperforming. Yields are low, value chains are simple, and most farmers are subsistence producers. The product list comprises crops, livestock, and fisheries. The country's staple crop and the one most widely cultivated is maize. A level of anxiety and paranoia surrounds the crop after shortages led to riots that almost toppled Kenneth Kaunda's government back in 1990. Other major crops include cotton, soybeans, tobacco, groundnuts, as well as sugar, fruits, other vegetables, and flowers.</p>
<p>The low population density and challenges in service delivery means that even though 57% of the labor force are employed working the land, 81% of them are in vulnerable employment. According to the UN Zambia Human Development Report 2016, 60% of smallholder farmers in this sector are extremely poor, lacking the necessary education, skills, and financial endowments to increase productivity. Of the 58% of land suitable for agricultural production, it is estimated that only 14% is currently under cultivation. Over 60% of the country's 15 million people still live in poverty and the majority of them rely on small-scale subsistence farming for a livelihood. It is estimated that today there are 7.6 million Zambians of working age, and 46% of the population is between the age of 0 and 14. Bringing these people out of subsistence farming, increasing yields, and providing formal markets and more complex value chains, could be the answer to the burgeoning unemployment bubble.</p>
<h4>Maize panic</h4>
<p>Staple crops for the noncommercial farmers include maize, sorghum, rice, millet, and cassava. Despite the decades-old paranoia about food shortages, the maize market is pretty undeveloped, if buoyant. The national requirement is half of what is produced on average, and there is potential to do more. Eike Hupe, Managing Director of BASF Zambia Ltd, explained, &ldquo;The average maize yields for smallholders is a little above 2 tons/ha. With the right training and tools, smallholder famers can achieve yields of up to 5 tons/ha or more, more than doubling their output."" Smallholder farmers produce about 90% of the country's maize and the government buys a percentage of the product. This year it is buying 220,000 tons from private grain dealers and suppliers. On average, Zambia annually consumes 800,000 tons of maize for industrial purposes and 2 million tons for consumption. During the 2014-2015 season, Zambia exported 700,000 tons of maize to Zimbabwe, 300,000 tons to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 200,000 tons to Malawi, and a total of 500,000 tons to Namibia and Botswana.</p>
<h4>Exporting</h4>
<p>The pursuit of better margins among savvy farmers has led to a more diversified basket of goods and is reflected in the fact that Zambia's exports are growing and diversifying. Commercial farmers, who farm less than 1% of Zambia's 750,000sqkm, prefer to grow higher value crops such as sugar, tobacco, wheat, soybean, and maize, which have grown by 27% p.a. since 2000, according to the World Bank, which also noted how the number of exporting firms, products, and destinations has also grown quickly.</p>
<p>Zambia is home to some impressive agri-entrepreneurs who have created sizable value chains in country. Zambeef epitomizes this, a USD230 million company, that started 20 years ago with two young men delivering beef from the back of a Land Rover. Today, it is a sophisticated multinational listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange, with operations in Nigeria and Ghana. Zambeef employs 6,000 directly, produces a quarter of Zambia's wheat and soya, and has 150 retail meat outlets nationwide. TBY spoke to Carl Irwin, joint founder and CEO of Zambeef, who recounted how it is branching into poultry, breeding chicks, and selling them and feed. &ldquo;We also want our stock feed and day-old chickens to be available to the informal sector as well, which is a major market for us. By making our stock feed and day-old chicks both conveniently available and competitively priced for the informal sector we have made that sector a customer rather than a competitor.""</p>
<p>There is a structural reason for why the informal sector is larger than the formal sector. Land in Zambia, according to the Lands Act, is owned by the state, and farmers are not owners of the land they live on; they instead lease the land from the government, if they formally operate on it at all. The law states that the President may lease land vested in him to any Zambian, or non-Zambian under specific circumstances, which is referred to as leasehold tenure. Leasehold tenure may be granted for a maximum period of 99 years, with the possibility of extension. Ultimately, because the land is not owned by the farmers, it means that farmers are not able to offer land as collateral if they want to invest in their farm, buying machinery or new seed varieties. Another aspect is that there is a 17.5% VAT on farm inputs, which can be claimed back, but the delay often cripples cash flow. The government is providing some encouraging tax rates to try and stimulate the sector. Usually, the tax rate is 35%, but for agribusinesses it is 10%, which is one attempt to free up capital for investment.</p>
<p>This goes some way to explaining why Zambia's export basket is not reflective of its potential. Luck Mbewe, CEO of Zambia Export Growers Association, broke down the export figures: &ldquo;Zambia exports cut flowers, fresh vegetables, and fruits to the EU and South African markets seasonally, and some vegetables are destined for the New Zealand and Australian markets."" Floriculture is one of Zambia's key export industries, exporting about USD40 million of roses every year. Over 60 varieties of fresh roses, such as Tropical amazon and Red calypso, account for 95% of production, with the rest made up of summer flowers such as amaranthus and bupleurium. The sector employs more than 6,000 people, of whom half are women; this figure, however, is a little more than one-third of the figure a decade ago, which is symptomatic of technical advances.</p>
<p>There are no exemptions on duty for horticulturists, and the sector no longer enjoys the duty-free status once enjoyed by exporters. Kenya and Ethiopia, meanwhile, are surging ahead in this sector. Kenya's cut-flower exports increased 12-fold to 137,000 tons between 1988 and 2014, and is now the world's third-largest flower exporter, employing half a million Kenyans, bringing in USD600 million per annum. Zambia would do well to look northeast for an example of how logistical infrastructure goes hand in hand with a developed agricultural sector.</p>
<p>One sub-sector that has been receiving a great deal of attention from the government is the fishing industry. Historically, with its lakes, rivers, and swamps, fishing has been a popular pursuit. But with demand for low-cost protein on the rise, many are beginning to see Zambia's water as a source of food as well. &ldquo;Fish can open up a whole new channel of providing affordable protein to a large growing population within the region,"" explained Bryan McCoy, CEO of Yalelo. &ldquo;Given that the two most advanced fish feed plants in sub-Saharan Africa will both open in 2017 in Zambia, it appears the requirements for a strong sector are falling into place."" The Zambian government has thrown its weight behind the development of an aquaculture industry; even President Lungu has put in fish ponds at the official residency of the country's head of state, State House. <br />Tilapia is the preferred fish in Zambia, and is at the center of this attention. It has strong export potential, and is being presented as both a commercially and socially valuable sector. Zambia imports over 60,000 tons of fish annually, and its immediate neighbors import in excess of 20,000 tons. To supply this demand, a value chain is developing, with feed manufacturers moving into the country to support more fish farmers for the years to come. As McCoy went on to explain, &ldquo;The private sector has identified a market in Zambia for fresh fish, and as long as the government continues to create an investment-friendly environment, the aquaculture sector will grow.""</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact remains that private players in the field have to source the financial capital needed to build physical infrastructure to lower supply chain costs for manufacturing. The likes of Zambeef, Yalelo, and the country's big milling companies have all received substantial funds to develop capacity and even in some cases build the transport infrastructure required to ship their products to where they are needed. Unless there are structural adjustments, the majority of Zambia's farmers tied to the land will remain tied to poverty.</p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/1efaa96f-2b9b-4a78-ad6e-82e808e4c507.png","","","","Much of Zambia's economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture and it has not yet undergone the significant structural transformation required to make it the breadbasket of southern Africa.","","Agriculture in Zambia","what-is-needed-to-build-a-basket","3762","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Africa > Zambia","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T05:20:00.000Z","2017-07-10T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Building Strong Foundations","","","","","","","","<p>For all industries in Zambia, 2016 was a difficult year, with the global recession, political uncertainty during the election, and commodity prices taking their toll. However, several key sectors stood out for their performance, among them building and construction. The sector has long been a star performer, steadily growing at an average of 17.5% annually over the last decade, Director of Buildings at the Ministry of Works and Supply Danny Mfune told the press in late 2016. As of 2014, the sector contributed 27.5% to GDP growth, reaffirming its significance as a key catalyst in the country's economic development.</p>
<p>Activity in the sector has long been supported by infrastructural projects initiated by the government, and in recent years there were significant investments made in the education, transportation, energy, health, housing, communication, and power generation sectors. Private-sector investment has continued to feature in the industry as well, with investment projects seen particularly in the mining sector as well as in the areas of real estate, particularly houses, shopping malls, and offices. The uptick in activity in the country is similarly reflected in investor confidence: The Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) in early 2017 announced that a total of USD3.4 billion in FDI had been registered in the country in 2016, a YoY increase of 0.7%. The construction and real estate sectors each recorded 9% of total pledged investment, just behind the energy, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors.</p>
<p>The government has acknowledged the importance of infrastructure development as a critical parameter of a country's development and that the existing gaps across all sectors have to be addressed, putting infrastructure construction on its agenda. In its 2017 Budget, the government of Edgar Lungu highlighted several key areas that would receive funding. Of note, ZMK8.6 billion was allotted for road infrastructure projects; ZMK1 billion especially for various infrastructural projects for the education sector, including schools, universities, colleges, and training institutes; and ZMK822.8 million was set aside to rehabilitate and construct water supply and sanitation infrastructure and solid waste management systems across the country.</p>
<p>The sector, however, has had to battle several challenges in the form of rising prices of raw materials, a decline in the value of the kwacha, and a lack of regulation in the industry that has at times resulted in shoddy work practices and inflated costs. Ministry of Works and Supply's Mfune had acknowledged the shortcomings in this area, and said the government is reviewing National Council for Construction (NCC) Act No. 13 of 2003 to address existing gaps in the industry and upgrade it to better match the country's current needs.</p>
<h4>SPILLOVER EFFECTS</h4>
<p>The upsurge of construction projects in the country saw positive spillover effects in the form of increased activity in the transportation, logistics, cement, and steel industries, and increased cement consumption in the country overall. As a result of the construction boom across the country, the Zambia Development Agency predicted an increased demand for steel from 200,000 tons in 2011 to 300,000 tons by 2016. Cement producer Dangote, similarly, saw a business opportunity in Zambia with growing demand for cement and supply deficits. Its new plant, with a capacity of 1.5 million tons, opened in 2015 and resulted in prices of cement falling drastically while projects that had been placed on hold were revived. Dangote Zambia CEO Desmond Maharaj told TBY, &ldquo;Our arrival was hotly anticipated. &hellip; With Dangote's entrance, cement prices have come down and stabilized. Stability was vital, as it afforded people the opportunity to plan longer-term projects more accurately."" In addition, given the higher cement prices in neighboring countries, he noted that &ldquo;even with transport costs, our prices are competitive,"" opening up export possibilities for the company. Similarly, given Zambia's ambitions to become a regional logistics powerhouse, the logistics sector is seeing similar construction frenzy in areas such as road and rail networks, warehouses, and logistic parks.</p>
<p>Chief among the government's priorities is transportation. The lion's share of its infrastructure budget has been reserved for road networks projects, among them the Link Zambia 8000 project, which seeks to upgrade and pave close to 8,200km of roads across the country at a cost of USD5.6 million, the Pave 2,000 project, which will rehabilitate 2,000km of roads using interlocking concrete pavers, as well as the L400 project to construct up to 400km of roads in Lusaka at an estimated cost of USD348 million. Phase I of the Link Zambia 8000 project saw close to 4,000km being completed as of 2016, with the remainder expected to be competed by 2021. When completed, the road network, which will connect several provinces and regions, will significantly reduce travel time and transport costs in the country, and play a pivotal role in spurring the economic development of rural areas. Dangote's Maharaj was in agreement, telling TBY, &ldquo;The road infrastructure of Zambia is difficult to negotiate. There is a great deal of development needed. The building of new roads connecting parts of the country will surely increase commerce.""</p>
<p>Another key area is air travel. Several projects are underway to construct new airports and modernize existing airports across the country. The largest project is the upgrading of Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) in Lusaka at a cost of USD360 million and expected to be completed by 2019. The Minister of Works and Supply announced in November that 33% of the project had been completed and that the expansion works of Zambia's largest airport has resulted in the employment of over 1,000 Zambians. Another key project is the construction of an airport of international standards in Ndola in the Copperbelt region. Set to cost USD522 million, the new airport, with a capacity for 1 million passengers annually, is expected to firmly cement the Copperbelt as a key mining, industrial, and air travel hub in the region. The construction project includes hangars, an air control tower, a fire station, a five-star hotel, a cargo terminal, a passenger terminal, and parking space.</p>
<h4>REAL ESTATE</h4>
<p>The real estate sector, in particular housing and commercial property, has been a hotbed of activity. The largest opportunities lie in the affordable housing sector, where estimates have put the shortage of housing units in Zambia at 2 million, requiring urgent action from the government. It seeks to increase the existing stock of affordable and quality housing and is championing private and public investment to boost construction of housing development projects and plug the supply gap. The Centre for Affordable Housing Finance (CAHF) in Africa had noted the presence of a substantial gap in the market between what companies were offering and what homeowners could afford in Zambia. In 2016, the going rate for a newly built two-bedroom, 65sqm house was about USD24,382 at the minimum, while developers targeting young professionals were building houses in the range of USD60,000-100,000. With several housing development projects urgently required all over the country&mdash;the National Housing Authority (NHA) has over 10,000 project proposals with a combined cost of GBP16.6 million for the construction of various housing types&mdash;measures have been enacted to encourage greater investment in the sector, including easy access to land, easy repatriation of profits, duty-free imports of certain raw materials, and the removal of foreign exchange controls for investors.</p>
<p>In terms of commercial space, meanwhile, as with any up-and-coming country, Zambia has seen a boom in shopping malls and offices in the last several years. Growing consumer demand from the emerging middle class in Zambia has for the last several years driven the boom in construction of shopping malls and developers are going all out to provide shoppers with better and larger shopping and entertainment facilities. Sydney Popota, CEO of Real Estate Investments Zambia (REIZ), which manages Arcades Shopping Mall in Lusaka, has ambitious expansion plans. He told TBY the company plans to &ldquo;expand the Arcades Shopping Mall from 19,000sqm to nearly 30,000sqm, adding 10,000sqm in two phases."" Outside of Lusaka, REIZ has plans &ldquo;to open in up-and-coming provincial towns, such as Choma in the southern province. &hellip; We also look at border towns as we see great potential there."" However, the company's strategy is not a one-size-fits-all: &ldquo;Solwezi is the new Copperbelt, so again, we will focus our attention there. &hellip; However, we will avoid retail as the mall market there is already saturated. Instead, we plan to build offices and residential and industrial properties."" In Lusaka, Popota also notes the lack of warehousing facilities that are up to international standards and sees potential opportunities there as well. Mei Mei Dolla Hill Shopping Mall in Ndola, noted for being Zambia's first-ever wholesale city, similarly provides warehousing and storage facilities for companies in addition to featuring an amusement park, a shopping mall, residences, five-star hotels, and a shopping mall to serve the surrounding regions. The first phase of the USD50 million-project was completed in 2016, and the entire city is expected to be completed by 2025.</p>
<p>The many projects being initiated across the country are expected to drive economic growth, employment, and development, and the attention given to infrastructural construction in particular is encouraging. Kelly Kalumba, Managing Director of Green Code Architects, noted to TBY: &ldquo;Since the beginning of this year things seem to be turning around. Many projects that were on hold are now being taken up again, and it is becoming easier to secure funding for large-scale developments."" He told TBY the fact that the government and the private sector are expected to embark on new projects is promising and he anticipates a great deal of movement and growth in the sector.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/51ffc69f-ce88-4048-9961-2331a44c1948.jpg","","","","A flurry of activity in the construction sector is expected to lead to further development in rural areas.","","Rural development","building-strong-foundations","1999","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a7b486b7b412f8a46317","Africa > Zambia","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-11T04:17:00.000Z","2017-07-10T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Making Moves","","","","","","","","<p>Surrounded by Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, and the DRC, Zambia is a land-locked country with significant potential in its transportation sector. An effective, well-maintained, and extensive transport network is essential for nearly all of the country's key sources of economic activity, and stakeholders are working to strengthen the country's relevant infrastructure. With an economy that is heavily reliant on mineral extraction, effective rail systems are particularly important, but funding for all manner of initiatives has been difficult to come by. As a land-locked nation, public and private officials alike are cognizant of the fact that international synergies and efficacious solutions are necessary pieces of the transportation sector's health. As Zambia seeks to become a preferred transport point for shipping across southern Africa, it is tackling the industry's most pressing problems with renewed vigor.</p>
<h4>Roads</h4>
<p>Zambia's road network stretches across roughly 67,671km, 40,265km of which is classified as the core network. Though only 23% of the core network is paved, according to the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Zambian Human Development Report for 2016, this figure is better than some of Zambia's regional neighbors. Rural areas often have inferior road systems, few of which are paved or even open all year. This can create problems for individuals employed in the agricultural sector, which is the majority of the country, because workers who cannot get their product to market are often left without income. According to the UNDP, only 17% of the population that relies on the agriculture industry for their livelihood lives less than 2km from a road that is open all year. Government leaders have long discussed plans for improving this system, and a number of corrective ideas have been floated. Increased revenue collection through tolls and other user-based forms have been considered, and public-private partnerships have been discussed.</p>
<p>One of the government's most important infrastructure projects has been the Link Zambia 8000 Road initiative. This three-phase, USD5.46 billion project is focused on extending and upgrading the country's road infrastructure over the next few years. Initiated in 2012, the project has sought to create 24,000 jobs while simultaneously transforming the country's road infrastructure by building more than 8,200km of roads and achieving extensive international and domestic land linkages by 2024, according to Zambia's Road Development Agency. Under Phase I of the project, 3,947km of roads have been built, and 678km have been opened to commuters, generating more than 6,000 jobs in the process. Phase II includes constructing 2,500km of existing roadways, 380km of which have been set aside specifically for Zambian-owned companies. Phase III is set to begin this year. Pave 2000 is a similar project tasked with overhauling and building 2,000km of roadways in more densely populated areas using concrete block technology and cobblestones instead of asphalt. The project is currently in its third phase, road construction, and this ZMW6.9 billion initiative is expected to be completed in 2019. Thus far, the project has led to more than 400 direct jobs, and experts expect it to generate far more. According to the RDA, an important aspect of Pave 2000 has been the employment and economic enfranchisement of women and youth in Zambia, and the scores of workers in these categories have been trained and hired.</p>
<h4>Rail</h4>
<p>With such a heavy reliance on mineral extraction in the economy, Zambia's rail networks are key transporters. Bulk goods and extracted materials rely on the railways, and these lines are key economic corridors. The country relies on two main, state-controlled operators: Railway Systems of Zambia (RSZ) and the Tanzania and Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA). RSZ focuses its activities on the north-south lines that interconnect with operators in Zimbabwe and eventually connects Zambia with the Port of Durban in South Africa. The RSZ line is nearly 1,200km long (900km of mainline and 300km of branch lines) and stretches from Sakania, near the Democratic Republic of Congo, to Victoria Falls, near Zimbabwe, and incorporates the vital Copperbelt region of the country. The network is one of the largest in the region and it provides the livelihoods for more than 1,000 people. The operator's fleet includes 48 locomotives and more than 4,000 wagons.</p>
<p>TAZARA controls the rail system in the east of the country, a corridor that facilitates access to Dar es Salaam. The 1,860km of railways is jointly owned by Tanzania and Zambia, and much of Zambia's copper is shipped internationally via this route. The railway had seen improved growth in a number of categories in recent years. First quarter YoY growth in freight transport grew 9.4% between 2015 and 2016, improving from 26,571 metric tons to 29,061 metric tons. First-quarter YoY growth in passenger traffic increased 20.2% between 2016 and 2017, jumping from 111,335 passengers to 133,863 passengers.</p>
<p>According to the UNDP's Zambian Human Development Report, traffic densities across the country are lower than the minimum required threshold of 2 million tons per kilometer to make these railways economically viable. This has disincentivized upgrades and expansion on the lines, and shifted much of the railway's cargo potential to the country's roadways. This had led to an overemphasis on and overburdening of the roadways. According to the Zambian Human Development Report, renewed investment in the rail system could lead to substantial economic benefits for the entire country.</p>
<h4>Air Transport</h4>
<p>Though still somewhat more limited than its road and rail transport infrastructure, Zambia's air transport infrastructure and capabilities have been improving. The country's National Airports Corporation operates Zambia's four largest airports in Lusaka, Ndola, Livingstone, and Mfuwe.</p>
<p>While the air transport industry has faced hurdles in recent years, including the closing of the national airline, Zambian Airways, and the departure of other large international carriers from the market, officials are confident that their improvements and overhauls will reinvigorate the industry. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Hon. Eng. Brian Mushimba MP, Cabinet Minister of the Ministry of Transport &amp; Communication, discussed some of the country's efforts to support the sector. &ldquo;In the aviation sector specifically, we have enacted new laws that have streamlined and aligned our industry to international requirements, and we have signed bilateral air agreements and extended fifth freedom rights to ensure efficient passenger movements in and out of the country,"" said Mushimba. &ldquo;However, expected increased flows of traffic, as Zambia becomes more of a tourist destination, demand improved infrastructure and we continue to do just that with the commissioning of the new airport terminal at HMNIA in Livingstone and new radar system at both KKIA and HMNIA. We are expanding and modernizing KKIA by adding a new airport terminal able to handle up to 4 million more passengers per year with many amenities such as airport hotels and shopping malls.""<br />Mushimba expects this project to be finished by 2020. Additionally, the government is getting ready to begin work on the new Copperbelt International Airport in Ndola, and this USD400 million project is expected to handle 2 million passengers a year. Other improvements are also in the works for Mfuwe international airport and smaller facilities around the country. KKIA is currently undergoing a USD360 million upgrade by the Chinese contractor China Jiangxi, and it is slated to be completed at the end of 2018.</p>
<h4>Logistics</h4>
<p>While 2016 was a rough year for Zambian logistics, with volumes being pushed down by a declining kwacha, falling commodity prices, domestic drought, and energy cuts, 2017 is poised to deliver important and much-needed recovery. Relying on its central location in southern Africa, Zambia is trying to turn itself into a transportation hub in the region. Firms across the country are trying to take advantage of improving economic fundamentals by expanding their business and offering more comprehensive logistics services to the market.<br />As Zambia endeavors to become a logistics and transportation hub for southern Africa, private industry leaders are excited by the county's potential. Zambian transport firms hope to utilize the country's four distinct travel corridors to move goods across the region. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Oscar Gutierrez, General Manager of J&amp;J Transport Zambia, explained Zambia's strong transportation potential. &ldquo;It is the historical, natural, and most cost-effective gateway serving Zimbabwe, Zambia, the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malawi,"" said Gutierrez. &ldquo;Zambia is a relatively young country with great potential to grow."" With the addition of linkage roads between economic and export centers and natural resource extraction zones, such as the Copperbelt, Zambia is paving the way toward transportation growth.</p>
<p>The government also has the ability to make doing business easier in the country, and industry leaders have a clear idea of exactly which reforms and improvements they would like to see. Olivier Terra, Managing Director of Bollor&eacute; Transport &amp; Logistics Zambia, enumerated a few of these in a recent interview. &ldquo;On a practical level, we need to work on improving border management and alleviate congestion at the borders,"" said Terra. &ldquo;Elsewhere, we see a stronger and more regulation-heavy approach from the Ministry of Transport."" While Terra is not overly pleased with the specifics of the most recent regulatory decisions, he believes the government's interest bodes well for the future. By recognizing that problems exist within the sector, the government has opened the door to addressing them in an effective and long-lasting way.<br />2017 looks to a be a year of growth for transportation in Zambia. As long as stakeholders in the public and private sector continue to develop creative solutions and focus on visionary infrastructure development, transport in the country is poised to have its best year in quite some time.</p>","","","","","As Zambia's transport and logistics sector looks to expand after a difficult couple of years, the country's central position and ambitious infrastructure spending projects are expected to facilitate renewed growth.","","Infrastructure spending","making-moves","4878","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405b","Africa > Zambia","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The policy is still in the draft stage, though those shaping the industry eagerly await its completion and implementation later in 2017.</p><p>Consultation on the Film Policy happened in late 2016, but only after bands of industry experts, filmmakers, and production companies joined forces to demand incisive and reasonable legislation governing their industry. This took place after President Lungu himself, in his full speech to Parliament in September 2016, called for greater commitment “to the development of creative and performing arts,"" stating that his “administration will promote the production and use of local content in the film industry.""</p><p>Zambia's industry is still very much in its infancy. With its roots in the Colonial Film Unit of 1939, film policy has always been firmly integrated within broader cultural policy: the National Arts Council of Zambia Act No. 31 of 1994; the National Cultural Policy of 2003; and the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act No. 17 of 2002, though to date this has not played a starring role in the sector.</p><p>As a result, filmmaking in Zambia lacks the sophistication and economic success of its neighbors, with local artistic talent going relatively unappreciated. Challenges faced by the industry include a lack of production infrastructure, with scant processing laboratories, sound dubbing, and synchronizing studios or editing facilities; a lack of human capacity, with few training schools or training programs; and a lack of appropriate financing mechanisms, with limited financial products to support film production, especially among entrepreneurs shooting productions with smaller budgets. </p><p>However, the potential to boost the industry—both on a local and international level—is huge, considering Zambia's photogenic scenery, its large, growing youth, and the recently completed migration process from analog to digital television. </p><p>A draft of the National Film Policy, making its way gradually through all governmental entities, proposes several measures to tackle the most pressing issues, including enforcing a local content threshold for television stations to encourage and support film production, endorsing local and international film festivals and enhancing provision of mobile video to rural communities to develop audiences, and spurring the inception of more distribution channels with tax incentives. Among the measures targeting improved human capacity are the implementation of a film element in the national curricula and the creation a national training plan for the industry. Similarly, the policy will promote the expansion of financial regulations, lower the costs of importing equipment, introduce a guarantee reserve for loans obtained by filmmakers, and facilitate the establishment of a Film Development Fund.</p><p>Emphasis will be placed on international exchange, with the policy championing a collaborative approach. All production companies from outside Zambia will be required to partner with local production companies, and bilateral agreements between the two parties will be drawn up at the beginning of any such partnership. Furthermore, the government will incentivize PPPs in the industry, stressing knowledge sharing and relations between local and foreign production houses. Finally, the government has professed a commitment to evaluation and follow ups, charting, through periodic surveys and research, the success of the policy and ensuring accountability, transparency, and overall effectiveness</p><p>As Catherine N Phiri from Media 365 told TBY, “The film industry should not be seen as another social development project, but as a viable industry that unlocks creativity and contributes to GDP and foreign exchange inflows."" The completion and enactment of the National Film Policy, the first in Zambia's history, will therefore be an invaluable step towards achieving this goal. And, with promises that it will come to fruition later this year, many are hoping this means lights, camera, action! </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The long-neglected film industry is getting a well-deserved boost in the form of a dedicated policy that will tackle several pressing issues in the sector.","","National film policy","box-office-success","1844","552ef2b0361618126878404e","595de95f86b7b01a7426d31a","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two years on, the USD75 million data management and storage facility has finally been launched. The ZNDC has been built to Tier-III standards, with 3 petabyte (PB) storage capacity, roughly equivalent to 3 million HD movies. The facility consists of a production center, software, and infrastructure services, and two back-up facilities and recovery sites located in Kitwe and Roma, respectively. A platform for providing hosting services to private and public sector institutions, the establishment of the ZNDC is a vital step in the move toward a fully electronic governmental system. As well as improving administration and efficiency in data management systems across the country, the center will also be a valuable tool in reducing ICT expenditure. ZNDC Ggeneral Manager Garry Mukelebai revealed to the press that the data center will be down for only 94 minutes a year, giving shareholders near-permanent access to their data.</p><p>The ZNDC was constructed by Huawei Technologies following the signing of a financing agreement between President Lungu and Chinese President Xi Jinping during a state visit to China in 2015. A further USD365 million will be spent on the construction of a computer assembly plant, also located at the ZNDC, as well as on other initiatives as part of Smart Zambia.

"2017-07-05T11:09:00.000Z","2017-07-05T11:09:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Heavy Metal","<p>Zambia flourished in the commodity boom of 2004-2011, with the economy reaping the benefits and growing an average of 7% YoY. Copper exports are Zambia's number one source of foreign exchange, and as receipts reduced starting from 2011, the local currency slipped into depression, which in turn increased inflation because the Zambian CPI features a large proportion of imported goods. The global surplus of copper, compounded with the difficulties related to production in Zambia, meant Zambian mines have been unable to match their counterparts in other parts of the world in providing cheaper copper. Furthermore, Zambia has been suffering from its own supply problems, as the Honorable Minister of Energy David Mabumba told TBY: “Between early 2015 and up to October 2016, Zambia's rainfall pattern was poor, and with low water levels in many of our hydro plants, generation capacity—of which 95% comes from water sources—fell almost 50%.“ Or, as resident Director of Maamba Collieries, Ashwin Devineni, put it: “Mining companies in Zambia are not getting their due share of energy owing to the severe power deficit.“ The global surplus then, compounded with the difficulties related to production in Zambia, meant Zambian mines have been unable to match their counterparts in other parts of the world in providing cheaper and cheaper copper. </p><p>In addition, high interest rates limit the amount of capital that can be borrowed by firms such as logistics and transportation companies, which deal directly and indirectly with the mining industry, looking to mitigate a forced downsizing of their operations.</p><p>However, since late 2016, there has been somewhat of a reversal of fortunes for commodity markets, particularly the copper industry. In 4Q2016, global copper prices jumped 10%, reaching USD6,101 a ton by 1Q2017. The current uptick in prices has much to do with recent events tipping the scales of supply and demand. The first of these is increased manufacturing activity in China. The official China manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from late 2016 came in at 51.2, nudging over the halfway mark to indicate expansionary activity, as opposed to contraction. This was the fastest rate of improvement since March 2011, and was great news for copper sales. A second important factor is the possibility of high demand in the US following Donald Trump's promise to pump a significant amount into funding infrastructure projects. Economists in Zambia are keenly tracing the so-called “Trump effect“ on copper prices, claiming increased spends on structural projects, as well as the growing likelihood of another war on ISIS, should keep prices up well into the year.</p><p>Herryman Moono, the National Secretary of the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ), explained, “The key message for a country like Zambia is that there is a need to diversify the economy if we are to be insulated from copper price volatility. In addition to this, it is important to make proper use of revenues from copper during periods of copper booms by setting up a stabilization fund.“ Such a mineral stabilization fund, like the one established by the Chilean government in 2007, was advocated by the EAZ late 2016 as a way of protecting the country from further fluctuations in the copper price. </p><p>It was not until the slump that diversification was placed back on the agenda with any serious momentum. In his inauguration speech on September 13, 2016, HE President Lungu stressed the need for Zambia to diversify away from copper into agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism, calling for the public sector to improve policy relating to these areas, and for the private sector to seize opportunities as they were made available. <br>As the mining community begins to celebrate the bright outlook at the beginning of 2017, others are advocating for caution. There is the real danger that Zambia will make hay while the sun shines and forget about all its wet-weather contingency plans. Indeed, if these ups and downs in the copper price have taught us anything, it is that where copper prices are concerned, the only thing that we can be certain of is uncertainty. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Copper Prices","heavy-metal-zambia-2017","1966","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these extensive linkages are more than not often used to bring wares into the country than to send them out. In fact, the current share of domestic products and services consumed by the public and private sectors is exceptionally low, varying from 4-5% in the mining sector to 15-25% in others. Indeed, Roseta Chabala, President of the Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM), highlighted that Zambia has a long history of choosing foreign goods over those produced locally, with the government notoriously quick to import everything from protective clothing to school desks. Chain stores, similarly, prefer to stock goods from South Africa, China, and India rather than Zambia.</p><p>Sourcing products from abroad instead of investing in the country's production adds to the forex drain and ultimately results in a long-term balance of payments deficit for the country. Moreover, other key macroeconomic advantages to stocking local products include increased innovation and competitiveness among local companies, lower production costs, more value chain linkages across different industries, and the generation of downstream support service industries. Buying locally reduces delivery time, cost, and paperwork, eliminates the need for bulk buying and tying up working capital, and facilitates procurement processing and access to after sales service.</p><p>Progress, however, is being made. According to the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), the manufacturing sector in Zambia accounts for about 11% of the country's total GDP, which has grown at an average of 3% over the last five years and can be largely attributed to the agro-processing and textiles industries. There are also several areas of focus necessary to increase the consumption of domestic goods. The first of these is the need to change the mentality that all that is local is sub-standard. If Zambians want to buy “Made in Zambia"" products, the market for such products could grow. The second relates to policy and regulation. Many have called for reviews to The Citizen's Economic Empowerment (CEE) Act of 2006 and the Public Procurement Act of 2008, which do not contribute to the economy in terms of employment, training, or procurement in the way they were intended to. The Minister of Commerce, Hon. Margaret Mwanakatwe, agrees that both the CEE and the procurement act need reform. “The CEE has, in the past, been an equity push, but we are changing now, to go toward value chain development,"" she said</p><p>The third area that will be key to the realization of this ambition is access to financing. Several strategies have been suggested, such as special financing windows for small businesses and a more concerted effort on the part of the banking system to pay more than just lip service to facilitating SME growth. Market penetration for SMEs in Zambia is generally low, partly due to market informality, but also in large part due to high costs of borrowing. As Leonard Haynes, CEO of First National Bank (FNB) Zambia, told TBY, “The Bank of Zambia's reports show that credit extension in kwacha has actually reduced over the last two years across banks… At the moment, deposit rates are high and the FNB is cautious about lending at high rates, which is irresponsible and not conducive to strong sustainable relationships with customers. Increased liquidity will be crucial to bring down these rates."" Other banks have emphasized the importance of offering training in financial management, as well as loans, to SMEs.</p><p>Some vital initiatives, such as the Business Linkages Champions forum launched by PEPZ, are targeted at more coordinated efforts between SMEs and corporates. They provide a common space for reviewing outdated policy and ensuring that the voices of all actors are heard. There is a substantial need to build the local production base before the idea of being able to take advantage of Zambia's advantageous land-linked topography can become a reality. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","To boost local production and wean Zambia off its dependency on imports, there needs to be greater focus on a change in mindset, a reform of the legislative environment, and cheaper access to capital for producers.","","LOCAL PRODUCTION","made-in-house","2087","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real GDP growth averaged 6.7% thanks to mineral outputs and a strong kwacha, but this all started to shift in 2014 when declining copper demand set off a series of cascading effects, slowing the economy and turning the kwacha into Africa's worst performing currency in 2015. Today, the country's industrial sector is facing a number of issues, including human capital shortages and problems with power generation due to water management issues. Still, the government's move toward an open market economy and the relative political stability in the country have it positioned as one of Africa's highest-potential markets.</p><h4>BY THE NUMBERS</h4><p>Although agriculture remains Zambia's dominant industry, industrial production accounted for just under 30% of Zambia's GDP in 2016, according to the CIA World Factbook. However, this overstates the significance of the nation's industrial sector. Mining remains the largest share of industry, and construction accounts for half of all non-mining industry GDP. Electricity and gas, which produces a further 10% of all non-mining industry output, contracted slightly due to power issues, but manufacturing remained more or less stable. After posting average quarterly growth rates of 6.7% in 2014 and 5.5% in 2015, Zambia's manufacturing industry saw growth stagnate in 2016, growing just 1.1% in the first quarter of the year. As of 2016, manufacturing itself accounted for roughly 11% of Zambia's GDP, with agro processing, textile, and leather the nation's primary outputs. Despite its problems, Zambia's economy is one of the more stable and promising in Sub-Saharan Africa, and its industrial sector is no different. Robust privatization programs have created significant opportunities, and foreign investors have taken notice: foreign direct investment in the manufacturing sector was more than USD1.2 billion in 2009.</p><h4>GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES TO BOOST THE SECTOR</h4><p>Zambia's standing as one of the more promising destinations for foreign investment in Sub-Saharan Africa comes thanks to its stable political situation and a bevy of government programs implemented to boost the manufacturing sector. The Zambian government has recently established Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZs), special industrial zones for export and domestic facilities that feature well-designed infrastructure and economic incentives to attract investors. With a minimum investment of USD500,000, firms receive exemptions from taxes on dividends for five years, as well as 0% corporate tax for five years (increasing over time to 75% of profits by the 10th year) and no import duties on the import of raw materials. In return, firms are responsible for building facilities and coordinating telecommunications and other infrastructure improvements. Viewed as combining the trade benefits of free trade zones and the structural economies of scale that come with industrial parks, the Zambian government sees MFEZs as one of the keys to increasing the nation's competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. The first legislation establishing MFEZs was passed in 2006, and gave the Zambian Development Agency the power to control and administer these zones. Since then, six sites have been designated as MFEZs: Chambishi, Lusaka East, Lusaka South, Lumwana, Ndola, and Roma, with the latter two officially industrial parks.</p><p>The development of the Chambishi MFEZ is a good example of how Zambia anticipates these sites becoming hubs for foreign collaboration and eventually generating spillover effects for the surrounding community. After China expressed a desire to establish five trade economic zones on the African continent, Zambia was chosen as the first of these sites thanks to its political stability and willingness to develop MFEZs in collaboration with foreign investors. The Zambia-China Cooperation Zone (ZCCZ) was inaugurated by Presidents Hu Jintao and Levy Mwanawasa in February 2007, with the goal of further developing the relationship between the two countries that have seen bilateral trade grow from USD108 million in 2000 to USD2.85 billion in 2010. Work on the Chambishi MFEZ began in 2009 and was conducted by China Non Ferrous Metal Mining Company Limited (CNMC). The project ran into early delays, with numerous construction difficulties leading to the project not being fully operational for more than five years after breaking ground.  As of 2016, more than 48 firms had operations worth USD1.3 billion in the Chambishi MFEZ, creating over 8,200 jobs. Most of this came from mining, leading to lingering concerns that the project is too focused on mineral extraction at the cost of neglecting value-added processing, but the Zambian government is confident that additional infrastructure improvements will lead to the development of the site's manufacturing sector. One key issue that remains to be resolved in transportation; although the site is accessible by both road and train, both need to be modernized and improved in order to handle the loads needed for significant industry.</p><p>Other sites have shown similar potential. The Lumwana MFEZ is a 1,300sqkm site with long-term plans of USD1.2 billion in investment and 13,000 jobs created. The Lumwana Property Development Company expects manufacturing of explosives and agroprocessing to be two of this site's key industries. The Lusaka East and South MFEzs have the benefit of being located near Lusaka International Airport and are currently in the midst of a five-phase construction plan that is expected to eventually produce high-tech industry, R&amp;D, and light manufacturing. Lusaka South MFEZ had attained USD785 million of investment as of mid-2016, with additional interest from more than 150 investors being reviewed. 14 companies had already agreed to lease spaces at the site, with these signings worth more than USD330 million.</p><h4>ELECTRICITY SHORTAGES</h4><p>One of the biggest barriers to Zambia's manufacturing industry is the country's unreliable power supply. Zambia has long been plagued by power shortages that have thrown its economy into turmoil, and 2016 was no different. Electricity production dropped to 75% of the previous year's level in the first six months of 2016 as a result of insufficient hydroelectric generation at the country's largest reservoirs. These hydro-reservoirs, which produce over 90% of Zambia's electricity, had already seen issues after low rainfall levels in 2014 and 2015, but increased water usage in 2015 further stressed the system and led to inadequate water levels. Zambia's government launched a policy of eight-hour rolling power blackouts in July 2015 to lessen demand, but the problem has persisted.</p><p>It goes without saying that Zambia's continued issues in this regard are crippling its economy as a whole and its industrial sector in particular. Expensive emergency electricity imports have been one of the major forces behind the government's fiscal pressures, as a USD100 million subsidy was needed to keep the price of electricity constant in the face of the shortages. As a result, Zambia's arrears have surged to ZMK10 billion, equal to about 20% of spending, and the nation's credit rating has taken a hit, reducing investor confidence and the economic growth opportunities that come with foreign investment. The outlook for electricity supply is more positive in 2017 as the government plans to reduce its debt, remove some of the inefficiencies that have plagued the sector, and put the state energy company through a thorough review.</p><p>Even amidst these challenges, there is a sense of growing optimism around the sector. Atlas Copoco Zambia Country Manager Patrick Chanda expressed the general feeling when he told TBY that, “we are encouraged by the way things are going: In the last 10 or 15 years there have been vast improvements in terms of skill developments, which… has brought in some well-needed balance."" Perhaps more than anything else, it is this optimism that will be essential as Zambia's industrial sector tries to make the leap to being an established high-value part of the nation's economy. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/5056b79f-db57-438e-b77a-15a8f0cd01cb.jpg","","","","Fiscal issues and inadequate infrastructure have hampered growth, but there is still a sense of optimism about Zambia's industrial sector.","","","looking-to-the-future","3535","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

National power demand, registered at 1,600MW at the end of 2009, is predicted to nearly double by 2020 to exceed 2,500MW. Combined with the low rainfall of the past two years, this means Zambia's energy production, still hugely dominated by hydropower (99%), is in the throes of an crisis, facing a power deficit of around 560MW. </p><p>However, the end of 2016 has seen both government officials and the private sector driving the diversification agenda with renewed intent. Amidst calls for innovation and investment in geo-thermal, wind, and, of course, hydro-energy, it is the colossal potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems that is stealing the limelight. <br>In May 2016, President Edgar Lungu commissioned a USD1.2 billion project, led by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), to construct two solar plants in Southern Lusaka. The two plants will have installed capacity of maximum 100MW, making significant tracks in the IDC's target to eventually develop 600MW of solar power. The plants, installed on approximately 120ha of land at the Lusaka South Multi-Facility Economic Zone (LSMFEZ) and with an estimated cost of USD150 million, are the fruits of round one of the World Bank's “Scaling Solar"" program in Zambia. </p><p>A World Bank initiative, “Scaling Solar"" tackles the challenges faced by those who are new and inexperienced in the market: a lack of institutional know-how in managing power concessions and purchase agreements and drawbacks that may be deterrents for investors, such as lack of scale and competition and high transaction costs.</p><p>In June 2016, the country tendered solar electricity at just USD0.06 per KWh, the cheapest-ever solar power on the African continent. Three international companies won bids to build large-scale PV plants across the country. France's Neoen SAS and American PV manufacturer First Solar, who jointly bid at the record low rate, partnered to draw up the blueprints for a 45MW plant. The third company, Italian-owned Enel Green Power, was awarded the tender to build the 28MW Mosi-oa-Tunya PV facility, a project that will require approximately USD40 million in investment. Once the plant begins operations, projected for 2Q2017, Enel Green will sell the generated electricity for USD0.0784/kWh to state-owned Zambia provider ZESCO. Both of these tenders are set at a fixed price under a 25-year PPA.</p><p>Zambia's record result sparked a series of even more competitive tariffs in India, Mexico, Peru, and Dubai. The success of the “Scaling Solar"" initiative in Zambia so far refutes the preconception that poor countries, with weak institutions and flimsy frameworks, cannot offer competitive rates for renewable energy or a friendly environment in which to do business. </p><p>Following the success of this first round, Zambia is proceeding with a second round of “Scaling Solar"" auctions and a further 150-250MW of solar PV capacity will be up for tender by end 2H2017. And, once this round is complete, a third auction will serve up another 250-350MW of power to reach the full target of 600MW. Taking inspiration from the program, other international investors are making their first incursions into the industry. The Zambian Development Agency has announced a proposed investment by a German company looking to funnel USD500 million into setting up a plant with maximum capacity of 400MW in two developmental phases. Similarly, Italian energy company TerniEnergia, part of Italeaf Group, was awarded an USD8 million EPC contract to build a 34MW plant in the country. </p><p>This year has seen the launch of several home-grown solar projects too, such as Zambian start-up Muhanya solar, which is working in the Zambezi river region to build a 20KW solar-storage microgrid and the USD300 million solar plant in Kazungula earmarked for construction in 2017 by local company GIWU Investment. With this kickstart from the World Bank, prospects look bright for Zambia's solar industry. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","As power demand continues to rise and power production continues to fall behind, it's the same old story for Zambia, still wrestling with an ongoing energy crisis.

"2017-07-05T08:36:00.000Z","2017-07-05T08:36:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Copper Load","<p>Zambia, like many other African nations, is blessed with vast natural resources under its surface. The landlocked nation is home to the world's highest-grade deposits of copper, and in 2016 it was the seventh-largest producer of the metal. While the economy has diversified in recent years, copper still makes up 80% of the nation's exports. It stands to reason, then, that Zambia's mining sector is one of the country's most critical industries. Decreases in global demand have slowed Zambia's economy as a whole, but plans for new infrastructure and the government's willingness to work with foreign investors have industry participants optimistic about the future of Zambia's mining sector.</p><h4>BY THE NUMBERS</h4><p>Zambia's mining landscape dates back to 1995, when the Zambian government passed the Mines and Minerals Act. This bill simplified investment and licensing processes, reduced tax burdens, and opened the sector up to international investors, paving the way for a wave of mine privatization in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In the early years of the 21st century, strong demand for raw materials led to a commodities boom, helping Zambia's economy grow more than 6% per year over a period of a decade that saw the sector attract more that USD8 billion in investment and grow in size from 27,000 employees in 2000 to 80,000 in 2013. The 2008 financial crisis led to a fall in the GDP growth rate, but commodity prices quickly reached new highs, resulting in growth of an impressive 10.3% in 2010. Since then, however, falling Chinese demand and a host of other correlating economic issues have slowed the country's growth and put the industry in the unenviable position of producing more to earn less; mining production rose from 708,259 tons in 2014 to 710, 860 tons in 2015, but a 23% drop in prices mean that revenue fell 9%.</p><h4>COAL STOCKINGS</h4><p>Copper is easily Zambia's largest mining output, but the nation has significant cobalt, coal, and gold deposits as well. Coal, in particular, is seen as having significant growth potential, as production rose from 103,439 tons in 2015 to 126,050 tons in 2016. This 21.9% increase came largely due to the reopening of the Chinese-owned Column Coal Mine in Southern Zambia, which was closed from 2013 to August 2015 due to safety law violations. Government officials expect production to continue increasing thanks to rising demand from a thermal power plant being constructed by Maamba Collieries Limited, Zambia's largest coal mine. The 150MW plant, currently under construction, would use low-grade coal to generate the steam that powers the turbines; currently, more than 70% of low-grade coal is left unused, becoming an environmental hazard. With the plant expected to become operational in June 2018, optimistic projections indicate that coal production could grow tenfold within a few years.  Ashwin Devineni, Resident Director of Maamba Collieries Ltd, believes the societal benefits of the plant will help coal grow tremendously in the near future. “Zambia has coal, and it will benefit from utilizing it,"" he told TBY. “There is a fair bit of scope to increase coal-generated power operations in Zambia…  The government of the Republic of Zambia, through the Ministry of Energy, remains committed to give the go ahead on this expansion, since it will have a positive impact on domestic power generation levels.""</p><h4>INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS</h4><p>Electricity infrastructure improvements might be needed to keep Zambia's mines running, but additional transportation infrastructure is also needed to ensure that mining firms can send their production where it is needed. Zambia has a robust road infrastructure, but the country's rail infrastructure is still underdeveloped. This is of particular concern due to Zambia's status as a landlocked country; currently, most mining companies transport their metals to the Port of Durban in South Africa via road, but industry participants understand that transportation by rail would be faster and allow for greater revenues. To this end, Zambia has entered negotiations with South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zimbabwe to develop a joint rail network that will allow the region's landlocked countries to more easily and efficiently access South African ports. A proposed 580km line, called the North West Rail, is expected to cost USD1.2 billion and create more than 8,000 jobs during construction. Zambia obtained more than USD500 million from South African contractor Grindrod in 2015, and construction is expected to begin shortly. Zambian officials hope to have the rail line operation within 36 months. Upon completion, mining firms in Zambia's North-Western Providence will have new access to the Angolan port of Lobito, allowing for faster and more efficient transport. The North-West Line is far from the only transportation infrastructure project underway. In November 2016, the Zambian government signed a USD2.3 billion contract with the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation to construct a 388km railroad through central and eastern Zambia. Once completed, the line will link Zambia and Malawi by rail, forming new networks for international trade and giving Zambian mining firms a new route to the sea. The collaboration with a Chinese firm is particularly noteworthy considering China's status as the primary source of exports for the mining industry and a leading source of foreign investment. In 2016, Chinese investment in Zambia grew by USD295 million, and the nation has public stated its intentions to strengthen its relationships on the continent. Projects such as these bode well for the long-term future of the industry.</p><h4>TAX STRUCTURE</h4><p>While everybody agrees that Zambia's mining sector is central to the country's economy, there are differing opinions on whether the nation has been receiving an appropriate share of the sector's revenues. Under the investment promotion agreements that were part of privatization agreements signed in the late 90s, Zambian-based mining firms are granted a host of tax breaks that have led to disputes over whether their tax payments reflect their income. Data on mining-related tax revenues differs, but one report from the Zambia Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative found that the mining sector contributed ZMK2.2 billion in 2014, or a little over a quarter of all domestic revenue. This comes from a combination of VAT, pay-as-you-earn taxes, and mineral royalties. The mining industry's tax bill is also in question with regard to energy prices, where copper miners are currently locked in a dispute with the government over electricity tariffs. During the midst of the electricity shortages in 2014, the Zambian government increased power prices for mining operators by almost 30%. Mine operators, citing previously agreed-upon contracts, asked a court to rule on the legality of the increase, and the two sides have been in court ever since. A final ruling is expected to come in early 2017, and energy companies have projected that the mining industry would need to pay USD276 million in back fees if it loses. Zambia's clear and open tax structure helped fuel its commodities boom, but shifting global circumstances will likely require reform. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Zambia's copper industry has dealt with electricity shortages and falling commodity prices in recent years, but looks poised to rebound thanks to new transportation infrastructure and the rise of coal.","","Mining","copper-load","2187","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-05T07:42:00.000Z","2017-07-05T07:42:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","At a Premium","<p>Panama's insurance sector grew by a slight 0.5% in 2016 to a total value of USD1.4 billion according to the data disclosed by the industry watchdog, the Seguros y Reaseguros de Panamá, or Superintendency of Insurance and Reinsurance. Amid slowing economic growth in Latin America, this was significantly weaker than the country's 5.2% GDP growth in the same year. However, this figure was not a reflection of a stagnation of insurance activities in the country, but rather a change in the weight of various insurance categories. In fact, the total amount of policies increased by 13.9% to 1.36 million during the same period, with the highest growth rate observed within the categories of life, collective insurance for accidents and life, car insurance, and finance. Combined, these accounted for 73% of the additional number of policies. While the finance category included 20,000 new policies, displaying a 142% annual growth, it also reflected the biggest decline in dollar terms, plunging by 16% to USD116 million worth of insurance premiums, suggesting declining premium rates in the sector.</p><p>This year auto insurance was again the largest insurance line of the industry, with total premiums rising by 6.1% to USD283 million, representing 20% of the total industry. This was followed by health insurance, with collected premiums rising 10.5% annually to USD262 million, accounting for 18.8% of total premiums' value. Although the growth in auto insurance premiums seems to have decelerated, it is expected to rise again as a result of the compulsory auto insurance that was enacted in 2016. However, the profitability of this category is currently under pressure due to a 21% rise in accident claims. Overall, total claims paid in the industry were 2.3% higher at USD577 million. The highest value of claims were realized in the health category at USD197 million and automobile at USD174 million.</p><p>Panama's comparative advantages lying in its geographical location, connectivity, and its dollarized economy justify its vision of becoming a regional insurance and reinsurance hub. But in order to realize this potential, regulators need to modernize Law 63, which has been governing the industry for more than 20 years and fails to meet international standards, while at the same time limiting the regulator's supervisory capacity.<br>This need has gained even more importance after the inauguration of the extension of the Panama Canal in July 2016, which doubled the canal's capacity and is expected to raise insurance activities related to maritime cargo as well as reinsurance premiums in the country. Maritime casco insurance, which increased by 7% in 2016 to USD12.5 million, is expected to benefit from the new inflow of bigger Panamax ships expected to traverse the canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific, whereby major users are American and Chinese companies. General Manager of Panamerican Network Sulcelt Pitty told TBY about its strategy regarding this new developments; “Cargo and logistics companies, in particular, hold appeal for us. Companies that offer maintenance for the shipping industry are important players that we would like to work with. The number of vessels that cross the canal is steadily increasing, which implies a great potential for the logistics sectors in general, and we are ready to offer our insurance services to all the companies operating in this rapidly growing segment.“ She also signaled Panama's growing role as a regional energy hub, a segment Panamerican Network also intends to capitalize on.</p><p>The energy sector, especially renewable energy, is also the focus area of Marsh Semusa, as explained by Country Head and Managing Director Emanuel Abadia: “We currently focus on energy. Panama is growing not only in terms of the size of its economy, but also in terms of population. We have many immigrants, such as Venezuelans and Colombians. As a result, there are many new companies and developments taking place and all these need energy.“ </p><h4>Important Developments in 2016 Solidification of the equity base</h4><p>In the last two years the sector has been subject to the takeover and liquidation of three companies by the regulator: Seguros Constitucion in August 2015, Seguros Confianza in September 2016, and finally Istmo Reinsurance Company in December 2016. Istmo's equity base was ruled to be insufficient according to the law as the company had incurred losses of USD5.8 million in 2015 and USD28.8 million in the first nine months of 2016 after an aggressive expansion of its activities beyond Panama.</p><p>The industry watchdog's objective is to raise the equity requirements for the granting of licenses to insurance companies in line with international standards to ultimately safeguard the best interests of the insured. In this regard, a series of important reforms have been implemented to solidify the sector's equity base as well as to boost growth in the sector. The major legal developments that were introduced in 2016 were the new law of compulsory auto insurance, the introduction of corporate governance rules, and the obligation to have positive results in all branches that an insurance company operates.</p><h4>New law for compulsory car insurance </h4><p>At the end of 2016, there were 629,000 active auto policies in the country. The new law for compulsory car insurance was ratified by the president in 2016 and will be implemented within 2017. The new regulation is also designed to make the system faster and more efficient introducing new tools such as a call center. The industry watchdog estimates that around 100,000 cars circulate without an insurance policy, suggesting important potential for the industry.</p><h4>Corporate governance laws</h4><p>The banking sector had already adopted its corporate governance rules back in 2004. After a long delay, the Superintendency of Insurance and Reinsurance finally introduced a corporate governance framework in June 2016, which aims to introduce a greater involvement of the board in the management of the insurers' more sensitive businesses, and has an exclusive chapter on sureties. Lessons were learned as almost all insurers that have failed in Panama did so as a result of the mishandling of bonds.</p><h4>Reserve Requirements</h4><p>There are currently 26 players in the sector, and the industry has been subject to aggressive competition that has kept premiums under pressure, eroding the equity reserves and threatening long-term sustainability and capacity of insurance companies to withstand risk. In order to avoid bankruptcies and establish trust in the sector, in September 2016 the Superintendency of Insurance and Reinsurance approved two new regulations for the sector. Agreement 4 requires insurers to establish reserves in the event that branches are not profitable on an individual basis. Companies are now under obligation to manage the profitability of each business line (health, cars, life) and provide the necessary reserves in case any single one of these should make a loss. If a branch should make a loss over two consecutive years, apart from providing a reserve, the company has to present the regulator an analysis of the loss and its strategy to tackle it. Once the business returns to a profit, the reserve is released.</p><p>The other regulation that was introduced, Agreement 3, brings a more up-to-date technical note base, with more information for all new products.</p><h4>Expectations for 2017</h4><p>The Ministry of Economy and Finance has established a working group for the execution of a comprehensive assessment of Panama's legal and financial services sector. The working group is made up of representatives of sector supervisors, private sector executives, and a groups of consultants some with prior experience working in international organizations such as the FATF, the OECD, and the IMF. The group is expected to present its conclusions and proposals in the second half of 2017 in order to modify the sector's legal framework. <br>Another reform expected to come online in 2017 relates to health insurance and aims to bring more transparency to the policies and to the prices used as reference in the medical services.<br></p><p>Overall, as large infrastructure projects conclude, the sector is less dominated by reinsurance premiums and is shifting more toward collective employee benefits as the country gets ready to host an increasing number of foreign companies and immigrating work force that will need private coverage, as explained by Marsh Semusa's Abadia: “The collective side, which is employees' health and benefits cover, will grow considerably because the public health system in Panama is not fantastic. Therefore, providing employees with private insurance covered by the company is one of the best incentives an employer can give its staff here.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Insurance","at-a-premium-panama-2017","1462","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-05T06:19:00.000Z","2017-07-05T06:19:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Let There Be Oil","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/02a125f0-605a-4b8d-9540-0f58e6b1ba4b.jpg","Let There Be Oil","","","","","<p>Zambia's reliance on hydroelectric power sources for over 90% of its power grid, coupled with its aging power stations, resulted in a perfect storm when the country was hit by a severe drought in early 2016. During the height of the crisis, the country had a power deficit of over 550MW and the government was forced to import electricity at high costs. This hampered economic development and GDP growth stalled at 2.9%, but is set to climb again to 4% in 2017, according to the World Bank.</p><h4>Power Generation Push</h4><p>Zambia's energy sector remains a fundamental point of debate amidst the country's political spheres. In contrast to many of its neighbors, Zambia has enjoyed decades of surplus power, which it exported to its partners in the Southern African Power Pool. However, years of insufficient maintenance and limited investment in new sources of power, mostly justified by the government's refusal to bring the price of electricity closer to a cost parity, have left the country facing a depleted power generation matrix. The challenges are considerable, and coupled with last year's drought, the situation became importunate.<br>The energy sector in Zambia is highly subsidized, and this has posed a problem for decades. The country was one of the first nations in Africa to adopt a privatization process of its power generation sector through the enactment of the Energy Regulation Act in 1995 and the establishment of the Energy Regulation Board, notably the first independent energy regulatory institutions in English-speaking Africa.</p><p>However, attempting to sustain one of the lowest energy tariffs in Africa at USD0.03 per KWh, more than three times lower than neighboring Tanzania, has considerably hampered the entry of private investors, as it remains impossible to turn a profit in the Zambia's power sector. State-owned ZESCO, the country's biggest utility, accounting for more than 80% of the country's power generation to the national grid, runs on a crippling debt to maintain prices artificially low and finds itself incapable of revamping its derelict infrastructure. With the exception of the Copperbelt Energy Corporation (CEC), which serves Zambia's mining sector, the only other player in power generation on the market is Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Company (LHPC), which in 2001 purchased the Mulungushi and Lunsemfwa power plants with a 38MW power generation capacity.<br>As the government itself lacks the resources to fund new power generation projects, involving the private sector has become ever-more paramount. As Minister of Energy David Mabumba told TBY, “to bring these players on board we need to make sure the business environment is attractive enough, which is what the government is focusing on at the moment, with incentives and collaboration with the IMF and other global organizations.“ This has translated into debates about progressively reducing the level of subsidies applicable to electricity supply to bring it closer to production costs and make it more attractive to investors. Cost-reflective tariffs are expected to come into effect between late 2017 and early 2018. This should again make power generation a profitable business in Zambia and potentially accelerate a stalled privatization process that has dragged since the 1990s with little benefits for the economy.</p><p>Zambia's potential to become a net exporter of electricity is considerable, as the country is estimated to possess around 6,000MW of unexploited hydropower potential. The conclusion of the Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro project, which should be commissioned by 2019, should bring some balance to the industry. Financed and developed by Chinese entities, this USD2 billion dam will produce 750MW of power in the short term and allow some breathing room for both the government and the economy.</p><p>Efforts to improve relations with the private sector to promote investment have already yielded some successes. The Scaling Solar project, for instance, which began in 2015, supported by the country's international partners, aims at producing 600MW from solar power projects in the near future. The government has already tendered 100MW, awarded to Enel Green and Neoen, and a second tender for 250MW is materializing in the first quarter of 2017. This is the first major experience with solar power in Zambia and the relative low cost per KwH from solar should bring efficiency to the country's power matrix. Speaking to TBY about the potential of renewables to improve power generation in the country, Minister Mabumba said; ""If we want to industrialize the country and meet our pledge to generate 1 million jobs for Zambian people, then we need sufficient direct supply of power. For this, we need to unlock potential in hydro, coal, and nuclear. Solar energy is a complement to this. While it cannot support large-scale industrialization, it can play a vital role in unlocking the potential of rural areas, which may be 10-20 years away from accessing energy through the national grid.“</p><p>Another surprising development is that of nuclear power. A source of energy that has been contentious since it first emerged in the global market, nuclear has had a negligent role in Sub-Saharan Africa's energy matrix over the last century. With the exception of South Africa, which has two nuclear reactors generating 5% of its electricity, there are no reactors south of the Sahara Desert.</p><p>That might be about to change. In December 2016, Zambia announced the signing of three Memorandums of Understanding related to a single nuclear project with Russian state atomic energy company Rosatom. The agreements establish the beginning of a process aimed at establishing a 2GW nuclear reactor in the country. The plan establishes a vision of Zambia with nuclear power supply in the next 10-15 years, as well as support with legislation drafting and capacity building. The plant is said to cost up to USD10 billion. It is uncertain how the government plans to finance such a venture.</p><p>Investment in Zambia's coal resources, which can be found throughout the country, particularly in the Sinazongwe region, are also being eyed as a potential source of income and power supply security.<br>In another bid to involve the private sector, the government has been pushing the PPP model, most notably in the Maamba Collieries coal-fired power generation project. Maamba Collieries is in fact Zambia's biggest coal mining company, but, through a multiple-stockholder funding structure, it is also leading the development of a plant that will inject 270MW into the national grid in early 2017. The plant's capacity is set at 300MW, from which 30MW is redirected to the mine's own consumption. A second phase should see the plant expanded to produce 600MW as demand rises. Since the commissioning of the first generator in July 2016 the grid has already been receiving 65MW from the plant, which has gone some way to easing the difficulties imposed by the drought.</p><h4>Petroleum et al.</h4><p>One energy source Zambia has never been self-sufficient in is oil. This has not been, however, for the lack of trying. For decades, oil and gas companies have explored the region for hydrocarbon reserves to no avail. This was until 2006, when reports emerged that concrete finds had been made regarding hydrocarbon deposits in the region. The details have, however, remained confidential. Successive bidding rounds have seen only a mild interest by major oil and gas companies in canvasing the territory, and those have mostly come and gone. In February 2017, the government revoked five of the 17 exploratory licenses in the country due to companies not completing their minimum work requirements, which seems to indicate little interest in the acreage. However, two developments contradict this image. In the first quarter of 2016, the Zambian government launched a rather discrete bidding round for 40 oil blocks. The oil industry in Zambia is fairly opaque and little is known of who tendered or who won blocks. What is known is that in July 2016, American company Tullow Oil, undoubtedly one the most successful junior oil and gas exploration companies in African territory, acquired Block 31 and committed to a USD69 million investment in the area. Tullow has been particularly successful in recent years with massive finds in Uganda and Kenya, and is said to be one of the most knowledgeable companies when it comes to the East Africa Rift Valley System, which includes the great lakes that dot the continent from Ethiopia down to Zambia. Lake Tanganyika to the north has already been dubbed as a high interest area for oil exploration and it is possible that Zambia would hold reserves in its side of the lake as well. Block 31 covers the Southern part of Lake Tanganyika, which falls in Zambian territory. </p><p>In March 2017, Minister of Mines Christopher Yaluma said a consultant had been engaged to conduct oil and gas exploration in the Luapula and Northern provinces and assess the areas' potential. The study has yielded positive results as Yaluma stated there is considerable oil and gas potential in the region, particularly in blocks 31 and 54. The discovery of hydrocarbon reserves in Zambia would have a major impact on the country's energy matrix and economic profile at large. After all, Zambia is forced to import all of its petroleum product needs as its processing infrastructure is losing its relevance due to old age.</p><p>Currently, all of the country's crude oil needs are met through the Tanzama pipeline, which connects the Indeni refinery, one of the few operating in the region, to the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. However, Indeni has been operating at half capacity for years, facing technical difficulties. Its operating costs, due to outdated technology and lack of maintenance, have risen and the refinery is becoming less and less economical. The government has been forced to remove subsidies on the retail price of the refinery's output, which has made the price of fuel skyrocket. A project was launched by the Zambian government to raise funds to replace Indeni with a new USD1.6 billion refinery but, since the announcement, the project has seen no further development. A small-scale refinery in Zambia, covering a fairly small market, would struggle to compete with more efficient and better connected refineries. This could change if crude oil was found in the country and a plan to renew the Tanzama pipeline to be able to export refined crude oil via Tanzania's sea ports has also been discussed. In October 2016, it was announced that Angola and Zambia were in discussion for the construction of a pipeline connecting the country to the oil-producing region of Lobito. The project had been raised before in 2012 and 2013, but no progress has so far been made. The pipeline would cost USD2.23 billion and supposedly bring crude oil from Angola for refining in Zambia. Since Indeni does not have the technology to refine Angolan oil, this would mean that the new refinery project could be more real than first thought. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/3201a076-1f65-47b8-a700-62cebfa811e7.jpg","","","","","","Energy","let-there-be-oil","2193","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5538d67986b7b0108818c458","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-04T10:03:00.000Z","2017-07-04T10:03:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Life, oh life","<p>According to projections disclosed by the Insurers Association of Zambia (IAZ), the sector is set to grow by 19% in 2016, compared to 17% in 2015 and 2014. Market premiums are estimated to reach ZMK2.5 billion, with general insurance premiums contributing ZMK1.7 billion and life premiums contributing ZMKK864 million. According to the IAS, for the first time in over a decade general insurance premiums have grown at a faster rate than life insurance premiums, at 23%, compared to 14% in 2015, while life insurance premiums growth was only at 12%, down from 14% in 2015. Compared to the African average of 3.5%, the contribution of Zambia's insurance premiums to the GDP is at a dismal 1.2%, suggesting a level of ZMK7 billion for the premiums to catch up with Africa's average.</p><h4>The First Steps Towards Consolidation </h4><p>According to the Pensions and Insurance Authority, as of August 31, 2016, the industry included 34 players, two reinsurance brokers, and over 220 insurance agents. Low barriers to entry allowed a growing number of players in a sector that has been growing at a slower rate than the GDP, resulting in an extremely competitive environment and an industry with a low capacity to absorb medium risk in terms of net retention rate. The Executive Director of the IAZ disclosed the resulting premium leakage in the country, stating that large numbers of insurance policies have been placed outside Zambia in the form of reinsurance premiums, contrary to Section 120 of the 1997 Insurance Act. According to IAZ estimates, between 2009 and 2015, Zambia lost over USD1.5 billion in premiums, from the import and export of goods into and out of the country. The need to reinternalize these premiums led the government to revise the minimum capital requirements in the industry and in October 2015, Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda on signed Statutory Instrument 71 of 2015, which will be implemented across the sector as of October 2, 2017. According to the new law, insurance companies' minimum required capital increased from ZMK1 million to ZMK10 million for short-term insurers, and from ZMK1 million to ZMK12 million for long-term insurers. For reinsurers it increased from ZMK1 million to ZMK20 million, and for brokers from ZMK40,000 to ZMK100,000. With the current exchange rate, the new minimum capital translates to about USD900,000 and USD1 million for short-term and long-term insurers, respectively, while those for reinsurers and brokers are about USD1.8 million and USD9,000, respectively. Apart from resulting in the retention of funds within the country, this new measure is set to trigger a new wave of mergers and acquisitions where bigger players will absorb smaller ones and consolidate their capital base so as to be able to absorb risk.</p><h4>Big Players Moving In </h4><p>Another major development in the sector was the entry of Prudential Plc into Zambia in 2016. With almost 170 years of operations, Prudential is one of the world's leading financial services groups, with 24 million customers worldwide and assets under management of around USD750 billion. Managing Director Krishnaswamy Rajagopal stated that “Zambia in particular is an attractive insurance market, with a combination of low insurance penetration levels, a young and growing population, and a rapidly expanding middle class… Life insurance penetration in Zambia is less than 1%, so there is plenty of scope for the market to develop rapidly. The size of the potential target market for mainstream insurance is roughly 600,000-700,000 people, but this does not include the informal sector where the majority of Zambians are employed.""</p><h4>VAT is Removed </h4><p>The VAT on insurance premiums, which had been introduced in 2011, had negatively impacted the industry, as it had caused administrative difficulties for the insurers, as well as levied a cost for the final consumer. After a long period of lobbying by the industry for the removal of the 16% VAT on short-term insurance policies, the government heard the plea and the tax was lifted as of January 2016, to be replaced by a 3% levy. On the one hand insurance was made more affordable, while on the other, although it presented no cost to the insurer, it still was an administrative burden that came to be greatly reduced under a levy system.</p><h4>A changing Panorama</h4><p>An important sectoral trend that was underlined by Prudential's Rajagopal was the increasing weight of life insurance: “We are also seeing the industry is changing rapidly—in 2010 there were four or five life insurance companies in Zambia, and today we have about 12 or 13, mostly international or regional players, although there is some room for consolidation. This makes life insurance the fastest-growing insurance line in Zambia.""<br>The structure of the industry is also highly dependent on the evolution of the economic activity in general. The CEO of Hollard Insurance Paul Nkhoma stated that the company grew by 30% in Zambia in 2016, a growth he attributed to the company's well-distributed network of insurance brokers that boosted the company's market share. He also revealed his observations of the evolving structure of the industry: “At Hollard, we break down our business into corporate, commercial, and individual sub-fields. Recently, we have witnessed a shift in the overall success of these markets, with the corporate space being our traditional biggest source of business. An increased number of SMEs as well as a more influential middle-income sector have filtered into that commercial space, and because of this we plan to focus our attentions there in the near future. That said, we also look to penetrate the life insurance market.""</p><h4>Innovative ways to reach a remote and uninformed population Microinsurance</h4><p>As the majority of the population is employed in the informal sector, the insurance industry needs to develop products that are all inclusive and not just adapted to the formally active population. Microinsurance is one of the tools that will provide appropriate insurance services to the low-income segment. However this proves to be a challenging process. According to the FSDA's 2016 microinsurance report, “Microinsurance products are complex; they require significant investment in research and development, as well as non-traditional distribution partnerships to reach a commercially viable scale. Consequently, it is difficult for any single player, acting individually, to develop the market.""</p><p>Still, the distribution of microinsurance has gained a wider access since 2009, when it was mainly distributed by microfinance institutions (MFIs). Today, various distribution channels are being used, such as banks, mobile network operators, workers unions, the post office, microenterprise associations, and community-based agents.</p><h4>Technology</h4><p>According to Rajagopal, technology holds great potential when it comes to more standardized products: “The take-up of technology in the insurance sector is at a nascent stage in Zambia. While it is a vital part of the insurance back-office, as a tool for interacting with potential customers, it tends to favour more standardised products over life insurance. Life insurance typically requires a conversation between the company and the client to understand the client's needs and the suitability of the product. We are supportive of technology that makes insurance more comprehensible, where customers can get the product that is right for them and their circumstances. We will continue to assess the Zambian market, evaluating the ways in which technology can be harnessed to improve customer relations.""</p><h4>A Large Network</h4><p>Familiar with operating in a heavily rural population, Zambia's former state monopoly ZSIC has a different strategy regarding the scope of its target group, as stated by Managing Director Charles Nakhoze: “In addition, unlike our competitors, which remained focused on large towns, we developed a larger distribution strategy, especially for our agricultural insurance and motor insurance products. By spreading ourselves across all districts, we have established business in areas that our competitors are not able to reach.""</p><h4>Education</h4><p>The Finscope 2015 survey revealed that 42.6% of Zambian adults have not heard about insurance. With this reality in mind, the Insurers Association of Zambia (IAZ) was tasked with organising the third annual Insurance week, which took place September 14-18, 2015. Activities were carried out in various cities including Livingstone, Chipata, Kasama, Kitwe, Ndola, Solwezi, Mongu, Kabwe, and Lusaka.</p><h4>Outlook</h4><p>The IAZ announced that the Ministry of Finance has indicated that the long-awaited new Insurance Act will be enacted within 2017. This move is a revision of the 2013 Insurance Bill, which is seen to be a progressive document paving the way for improved governance for the sector, recognition of microinsurance as a separate insurance category, and the expansion of intermediary service providers. Investor confidence is strong and the industry is hopeful of growth potential that Zambia represents, as it is participating into policymaking mechanisms with the government and sector institutions to refine and upgrade a sector that will contribute to the overall economic stability of the country. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Although Zambia's insurance penetration level is still at around just 1%, the sector is nonetheless pursuing a steady growth trend that is expected to benefit further from a series of reforms that will impact business results as of 2017.","","Insurance","life-oh-life-zambia-2017","3855","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-04T08:04:00.000Z","2017-07-04T08:04:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","IMF support program","<p>At the end of 2016, the IMF announced it would enter Zambia with an economic supplementation program midway through the following year. At the end of 1Q2017, Finance Minister Honorable Felix Mutati announced the conclusion of the consultative process preceeding the implementation of the support program. The finer details of the program—of what it will consist and how it will be packaged—have to be confirmed. Estimates say the sum of the financial support provided could be as high as USD1 billion, enough to help cover the financing needs stated in the government's 2017 Budget of USD1.2-1.3 billion.</p><p>Judging by the tone of Minister Mutati's many speeches given on the topic, it appears the Zambian authorities are determined to be the driving force behind any IMF intervention. “We are taking ownership and responsibility for the execution of our own economic recovery program,“ Mutati announced. “External organizations, including the IMF, as well as the international business world, and the private sector, must feed into this.“</p><p>In October 2016, the IMF conducted a mission in Zambia, led by Tsidi Tsikata, to assess the complexities of Zambia's situation and later diagnosed external and domestic shocks, coupled with an unbalanced policy mix, government overspending, and a build-up of arrears as the country's principal afflictions. While a tightening of monetary policy had resulted in more stable kwacha and low levels of inflation, the side effect, reported the IMF, was squeezed liquidity, which, combined with these other factors, had placed considerable stress on the private sector and the financial system</p><p>Such financial woes mean that many welcome the IMF's arrival in Zambia, while others naturally have their own reservations. As the Honorable Sebastian Kopulande, CEO of the Zambian Trade and Investment Center and MP for Chembe constituency, told TBY, “I am optimistic, though conditionally. We must define what we want. If we do not, then we will be contracting a long-term debt that will not be invested in economic activities to directly increase our capacity to payback.“ Indeed, many TBY interviewees have echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the vital role Zambia must play in these negotiations. “If we receive the promised resources from the IMF, we need to have mapped out how we will employ such resources, what exactly we want to achieve, and set success benchmarks, so that we make sure that this program works, and that it works for us,“ Kopulande highlighted.</p><p>The IMF also stress that conditions linked to loan disbursements must be appropriate to the country in question. In line with this assertion, aside from financing, the organization offers technical assistance, policy advice, public financial management, and banking supervision to its struggling member states. There are a growing number of sceptics expressing the usual concerns relating to IMF conditions. In 2016, rumors abounded that the IMF would demand the privatization of state-owned companies such as ZESCO or Zamtel and that it would crack down on government spending, reducing budgets for health and education. Their fears were not entirely unfounded. The government is sticking to its new year's resolutions, having embarked on a “fiscal fitness“ mission, with belt-tightening and austerity measures. In early 2017, for example, cuts were made to the substantial subsidies on fuel, a move that has been championed by numerous TBY interviewees in the private sector and multinational organizations.</p><p>Then, there is the question of what kind of package will be implemented and how effectively this will dovetail with Zambia's own economic recovery strategy. The devil is in such details for the likes of Charles Carey, CEO of Cavmont Bank, who told TBY he welcomes a support program in principle, but has concerns regarding what the effects, in practice, will be for Zambia's fragile economic recovery. “If the medicine required is more severe than the expected relief,“ he said, “we have to critically evaluate the rigorous and time-bound criteria to meet such a support program and determine whether the opportunity is really in our best interests.“ As he summarized, “It might not be the actual destination that matters as much as the journey we undertake to get there, which proves more valuable.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SME Growth","imf-support-program","3592","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-04T07:59:00.000Z","2017-07-04T07:59:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Exploring Possibilities","<p>Zambia's capital markets came to life with the promulgation of the Securities Act in December 1993, an act that also heralded the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC-Zambia), their regulatory body. Subsequently, the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) commenced operations in February 1994, as a firm step in the nation's shift towards liberalization and economic reform, including the privatization of state-owned entities. Naturally enough, the development of capital markets was seen as an essential means of galvanizing a transparent, efficient, and standardized private sector at home on the one hand, and rendering foreign investment an appealing proposition on the other. This was also to be a route out of dependency on loan facilities through the fostering of local businesses that would turn to the capital markets for the liquidity necessary for growth. In fact, after a decade of swift growth, Zambia is no longer a nation overwhelmingly dependent on grants, to the extent that in 2015 grants accounted for only 1.4% of revenue compared to 98.6% of domestic revenues.<br>Aware that such processes cannot be achieved overnight, the authorities foresaw, too, a gradual process of awareness building of financial and capital markets instruments that would ultimately manifest in the form of demand, including deposit receipts, exchange traded funds, and special securities in addition to more regular equities and bonds; the LuSE is the only secondary market for government bonds. Elsewhere, the Bond and Derivative Exchange Zambia (BaDEx), incorporated in 2009, has been a licensed exchange since 2011, regulated, like the LuSE, by the SEC.</p><h4>Some Economic Context</h4><p>A brief macro-economic detour is perhaps useful to grasp the still nascent nature of the LuSE. Approximately 80% of Zambia's exports are copper-dependent, and the decline in commodity prices observed in 2016 saw the US dollar value of exports slide acccordingly. During 9M2016, the value of exports, at USD4.588 billion, was down 10.4% YoY, greatly exceeding the 2.2% decline in exports overall. Nonetheless, World Bank forecasts point to commodity price recovery of 4.5% in 2017 and 2018 on more balanced global metals supply. And should this be accompanied by tangible progress over the nation's “Zambia Plus“ economic recovery plan, positive investor sentiment could follow.</p><h4>Fertile Plans</h4><p>A key objective of Zambia Plus is the transformation of the country into an agricultural hub. Related developments of late point to a process of standardization and pursuit of liquidity seen at the LuSE, albeit in the context of commodities, in this case agricultural in nature. The Zambia Agriculture Commodities Exchange (ZAMACE) has signed an agreement with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) on the listing of Zambian white maize, soya bean, and wheat futures on the JSE effective March 20, 2017. The advantages of this are both clear and lasting. A functioning derivatives market promises increased liquidity in the market, while providing farmers, consumers, and millers a hedge against price fluctuations. It also entails the availability of accurate and systematic market data, and fosters transparency and competitiveness in a nation where crop prices have historically not been aligned to international prices. Furthermore, proven success over time is expected to see a broadened range of commodity futures traded, ultimately encompassing the entire agricultural portfolio. And beyond that, enhanced competitiveness could allow Zambia to diversify away from its aforementioned heavy reliance on copper.</p><h4>A Pragmatic Offering</h4><p>The LuSE trades in both equities and debt, with the market served by seven registered brokerages. It became fully automated in November 2008 and today trades from 11:00 to 14:00 local time. The equity market, on which 22 stocks are traded, comprises two tiers, namely the listed, or main board, and the quoted, or second-tier market. The latter mechanism was devised in recognition of the fact that listing was considered by many would-be entrants as prohibitively expensive, or simply not possible due to their shareholding makup, and or newness, whereby minimum profitability periods did not apply. As Priscilla Sampa, Company Secretary and Acting CEO of the LuSE, explained in a TBY interview, “The alternative market was established to facilitate the entry into the market of companies not quite positioned or ready to meet the more stringent listing requirements of the main tier.“ The criteria for main tier listing stipulate that “companies have no less than 300 shareholders and a minimum float requirement of 25%.“ However, the alternative market provides  for a shareholding of 30 and a minimum float of 10%. Those companies quoted, rather than listed, nonetheless become visible to the public with the theory being that they will seek full listing when circumstances permit; that is, once a certain period of profitability has been demonstrated. “The Alt-M,"" Sampa explains, “is mostly made up of locals, while the main board is comprised of locals as well as multinationals, many of which entered the market shortly after liberalization.“ And having identified potential entrants to the bourse, a process has begun to assist with finding underwriters willing to enable that vital step into the capital markets. Close to 70% of GDP is generated by Zambia's SMEs, which as such has huge potential for future listings. The government has supported credit reforms geared toward SME growth and incentivizes listing by offering tax incentives exclusive to listed companies and stocks.</p><h4>Performance Muted by Domestic and International Noise</h4><p>Market capitalization of listed companies (% of GDP) at the LuSE was last measured by the World Bank at 14.58% in 2012. In that year it registered at USD3 billion. By year-end 2016 market capitalization had reached USD5.7 billion. Yet 2016 was an election year, and focus on that event and prevailing high interest rates dented credit availability, and hence consumption, which was felt throughout the economy, including the capital markets. Foreign investor appetite in Zambia was dampened not just by international factors such as Chinese economic growth, but also by continued teething problems in the local economy such as perennial energy shortages. The LuSE recovered towards the end of the year when favorable macro-economic factors such as the lower inflation and higher copper prices kicked in. Furthermore, Sampa added, “The Ministry of Finance has made significant policy changes that we hope will prove investor friendly, and encourage an influx of FDI that will boost the market's performance.“ A more recent glance reveals that as of March 24, 2017 the LuSE All Shares Index had gained 5.1% over the previous month, 4.7% over three months, and 5% YtD. Yet over the previous one-year and two-year periods it had posted respective losses of 20.3% and 27.8%.<br></p><p>The LuSE's trajectory will be hugely shaped by economic indicators. On February 22, 2017 the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) reduced its policy rate from 15.5% to 14%, the statutory reserve ratio from 18% to 15.5%, and the overnight lending facility rate from 1,000 basis points to 600 above the policy rate. This is significant in that the central bank was willing to do so to inject some much-needed vim into turbid economic performance, and was allowed to by lowering inflation; YoY inflation for January had declined to 7%, from 7.5%. Greater access to credit at lower rates should, thus, not only be felt in the real economy, but also the capital markets. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Capital Markets","exploring-possibilities","3975","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet this is still not fully realized in today's system of 18 commercial banks, which remains highly concentrated and dominated by a few. Two years later, the government set forth the Financial Sector Development Program, geared squarely at building up financial sector infrastructure to shoulder the weight of economic diversification and sustainable growth. A key element of this era in economic policy was the lifting of administrative controls on credit allocation and the setting of interest and exchange rates. In step with this, regulation came to the fore to establish universal practice and transparency in the sector. Meanwhile, appraising the sector in an interview, Charles Mudiwa, the Chief Executive of Stanbic, noted, “One of the biggest competitive advantages of Zambia from a banking and customer perspective, in terms of liability and capital movement (namely its lack of), is exchange controls for convertible currency, which means that capital flow is somewhat easier than many other markets, including South Africa.“</p><p>Among the top-four revenue performers in 3Q2016, Stanbic Bank Zambia generated a total revenue of USD87 million, followed by Zambia National Commercial Bank (Zanaco) on USD80 million, Standard Chartered Bank on USD76 million, and Barclays Bank Zambia on USD65million.</p><p>And by pre-tax profit, Standard Chartered led on USD42 million, followed by Stanbic Bank Zambia on USD31 million, Barclays beating Citibank by USD1million on USD21million.</p><h4>'Plus' Sized</h4><p>Needless to say, the economy is a crucial determinant of financial sector activity, and not least of banks' risk appetite. It will be useful, then, to consider recent developments on this front to better grasp the trajectory of the banking sector. On October 26, 2016 the government officially launched its “Zambia Plus“ economic recovery program. Its five pillars were together meant to restore GDP growth from current levels of around 3% to the 7% considered key to fuel development and curb poverty. A significant external partner in its implementation is the IMF. The projected outcome ranges from increased budgetary allocation to social services, to tighter regulation of spending decisions and improved economic stability through greater access to credit; the latter theoretically enabled by a reduction in high lending rates and lower inflation. <br>Recent IMF macro data on Zambia indicates that despite the kwacha suffering continued fluctuation against its major trading currencies, it rallied YoY in 9M2016. Indeed, between January and end-November 2016, it appreciated by 10.4% against the USD, 13.2% against the euro, and 2.1% against the South African rand. And meanwhile, in another “plus“ for the banking sector, having peaked at 22.9% in February 2016, annual inflation fell each subsequent month, printing at a more manageable 8.8% in November 2016. The IMF projects more sunshine, too,  anticipating 2017 GDP growth of 4%, up 1pp YoY. Inflation, too, is set to moderate change to 9% in 2017 owing to base effects. Zambia's GDP performance had slid in recent years due in large part to low global copper prices (copper accounts for 10% of GDP). In January 2016, copper prices were at USD4,471 per metric ton, 54.7% down on their February 2011 peak. Yet, since February 2016, prices had recovered to USD4,726 per metric ton by October 2016 and more so in November 2016 as commodities rallied on speculative buying post US elections, and as Chinese manufacturing appeared robust. Yet remaining below 2015 levels, despite higher production, the USD value of copper exports in 3Q2016 was 10.4% down YoY. This has all reflected in the lending tendencies of Zambia's banks.</p><h4><br>The SMEs...</h4><p>Zambia's SMEs account for 70% of GDP and virtually 90% of employment. It is clear, then, how their systematic funding could contribute to the overall economy. Leonard Mwanza is the CEO of the Bankers Association of Zambia. He told TBY that, “In 2016 economic activity was flat, (which) translated into the banking sector having flat loan books emanating issues of constrained liquidity.“ This had stemmed from the strict monetary policies mentioned earlier in tackling inflation. And while the goal was reached, “the cost of new deposits skyrocketed, sometimes as high as 35%, over the course of 2016, particularly in the first half (...), which led to subdued lending to SMEs.“ The current average lending rates are at a vertigo-inducing 29.4%. The government is working on an Entrepreneurial Fund for the SME contingent of the private sector, enabling long-term credit guarantees at workable terms. Additionally, in October 2016, the African Development Bank (AfDB) approved a USD50 million credit line to the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) dedicated to SMEs. A month later, the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) of South Africa signed a USD20 million credit line with DBZ dedicated to SMEs. Time will tell how sustainable this proves to be for the productive sectors.</p><h4>...and the Dilemma</h4><p>Sector data reveals that in Africa overall, less than 20% of households have access to formal financial services, which reflects heavily, too, on the business arena, massively denting economic growth. There have been encouraging periods. Between 2006 and 2011, the share of loans in total assets, notably to the private sector, rose to 43% from 36%. Conversely, for the same period, declining yield rates on government securities, being less attractive, resulted in banks' share of liquid assets declining to 35% from 42%, as divesture from said securities turned to loans.</p><p>More recently, on February 22, 2017 the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) cut the policy rate from 15.5% to 14%, the statutory reserve ratio from 18% to 15.5%, and the overnight lending facility rate from 1,000 basis points to 600 above the policy rate. It was able to do so thanks to the notable decline in annual inflation and the principal motive was to boost slack economic performance by making credit more available to the productive sectors of the economy. Yet as Armando Massimiliano Sirolla, the CEO of AB Bank Zambia, put it in a TBY interview, “Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to ease access to financing.“ Financial inclusion, he stressed, demands comprehensive commitment from “the government, the Bank of Zambia, the big players in the financial sector market, the investors, and donors,“ which is still not the case in Zambia. It seems that certain players view NPLs “as an excuse (even though) the actual rate of NPLs among microfinance companies is somewhere below 5%.“ AB Bank Zambia stresses the fact that each month it adds, “2-3,000 unbanked people to the formal financial industry.“ By BoZ data, the top sectors receiving credit on a one-year scale have been agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing. For January 2017, total loans and advances to all sectors stood at USD833 million. Among this total, the above three sectors respectively received USD245 million, USD132.4 million, and USD106.6 million. Incidentally, the government views agriculture as a key sector for economic growth once standardized. Efforts to this end may be seen in our capital markets chapter. Unfortunately, it remains a problematic sector for the banks, where during the 2005-2014 period roughly 47% of total loans to the sector from large banks were doubtful or in default, making it the worst offender. By contrast the energy sector, essentially state-owned, had just 3% of its credit portfolio deemed nonperforming.</p><p>From the field, TBY discovered active interest in supporting this potentially fertile sector, especially since only around 20% of Zambia's arable land is currently under use. Armando Massimiliano Sirolla explained how with Zambia's banks competing for the same 5% of the market, his bank deals with smaller loans, “providing credit of between ZMK3,000 and ZMK50,000 (micro-product), or between ZMK51,000 and ZMK3 million (SME product).“ </p><p>Its agribusiness product launched in 2015 and implemented a year later had assisted around 1,017 farmers by year-end, “with average loans of about ZMK20,000.“ Microfinance clients comprised 50-60% of the portfolio with 40-50% of SMEs. He noted that with the cost of borrowing in Zambia being as prohibitively high as 30%, small depositors are the sole source of liquidity. Meanwhile, Leonard Haynes, the CEO of First National Bank Zambia, told TBY that the bank is, “currently the fifth or sixth-largest bank by assets (and added that) a large portion of our balance sheet is in agriculture, some in dollars, backed by agricultural exports.“ This includes commercial farmers, “who require financing of highly specialized equipment, sometimes costing around USD500,000.“</p><h4>Innovation and Education</h4><p>Technology adoption, key to an alternative to bricks-and-mortar branches banking in many EMs, remains embryonic; just 3% of mobile users went online in 2016. Estimates put active mobile money users at around 417,000. Focused on remedying this demographic, AB Bank's Sirolla revealed its  ambition of ensuring “that the 6-8 million mobile users in the country know how to bank via mobile.“ The simple economic means to participate in the financial sector aside, education is key to advancing participation. Leonard Mwanza, CEO of the Bankers Association of Zambia, revealed the organization's efforts on this front, which in 2016 included organizing World Savings Day to promote saving. “In 2017, we are planning Financial Literacy Week, working with a number of stakeholders (including) the Bank of Zambia, the Insurance Association of Zambia, the Pension and Insurance Authority, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.“ This year the theme is “know and plan your finances to lead a better life.“ A nationwide educational campaign is also in the pipeline. Stanbic, meanwhile, has for two years, “run an annual energy conference with the Minister of Energy to bring thought leadership on that side,“ a scheme it incidentally replicates for the nation's vital mining industry.<br>Overall, Zambia's banking sector is faced with a classic chicken-and-egg scenario, in that while reforms have been forthcoming, a vulnerable local economy overly dependent on mining and compounded by externalities has prevented banks from cost-effectively supporting the economic diversification needed to boost economic performance. Specifically, as the IMF underlines, the provision of credit to the private sector has remained somewhat of a hostage to sectoral credit concentration and risk. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/a8efefe2-7c9c-478b-b0bd-6787c3f2ad1b.jpg","","","","","","Banking","macroeconomics-rule-the-roost","3903","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-04T06:13:00.000Z","2017-07-04T06:13:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Good Things Come in Small Packages","<p>Economists across Africa agree that the future of sustainable growth belongs to SMEs, and Zambia is no exception: micro, small, and medium enterprises in Zambia are estimated to provide 90% of jobs (informal and formal) for the working population, 30% of the country's total formal employment, and 50% of overall GDP.</p><p>And yet there are still several challenges facing Zambia's SMEs. In his 2017 national budget speech, Finance Minister Honorable Felix Mutati stated that “a significant number of our SMEs in Zambia demonstrate good commercial viability; however, they have limited access to conventional bank credit facilities."" Indeed, during the recession of 2015-2016, liquidity across all industries was squeezed and banks were reluctant to put their money in perceived “high-risk areas."" In addition, Zambia's SMEs, as is the case for SMEs the world over, possess collateral considered inadequate by normal lending norms.</p><p>A third hindrance to SME growth in Zambia is narrow understanding among creditors about the segment: its characteristics, its needs, and its potential. Further complications arise due to SMEs' own lack of knowledge, as well as limited access to skills, technology, and markets. Finally, given that the vast majority of Zambia's smaller companies operate within an informal market, it is extremely difficult for the authorities to monitor, regulate, harness, and boost the productivity of this segment. </p><p>However, the government has brought in several policies over the past couple of years designed to provide support to small businesses, entrepreneurs, and marketeers. The first of these was the Movable Property Act, a legal framework introduced in 2016 designed to unlock capital stock tied up in small, moveable assets, usually the items produced by the company itself. More recently the government has reiterated its determination to ensure reduced rates from commercial banks, earmarked some USD50 million for on-lending to SMEs, revealed plans to scale up its Women's Development Program, especially the microcredit component, and created an Agricultural and Industrial Credit Guarantee Fund for SMEs. This last policy speaks to broader targets set by the government to grow SMEs in agriculture and industry, since the ever-widening gap emerging between micro businesses and the large corporates is especially evident in these two areas. </p><p>Regulatory bodies have also jumped on board with tailored solutions for SMEs. In 2015, the Lusaka Stock Exchange launched its alternative market, which enables SMEs to issue equity and debt securities, encouraging higher standards of corporate governance and accountability, raising SME profiles and making them more attractive to potential investors. Furthermore, the LuSE has recently announced collaborations with the government to make available additional instruments more appropriate for these businesses. Elsewhere, the Banker's Association of Zambia is launching its SME Relationship Management Course, specifically aimed at educating banks on the importance of understanding the psychology and mindset of an SME. Foreign partners are also showing their commitment to the sector, with the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) to stage an investment forum for SMEs mid-way through 2017 and the European Investment Bank (EIB) poised to channel EUR56 million into loans to small Zambian companies.</p><p>However, as Armando Sirolla of AB Bank put it in an interview with TBY this year, “unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to ease access to financing. If we want to have an impact in terms of financial inclusion, we need have to have a strong enabling environment, with everyone committed to the same ideals: the government, the Bank of Zambia, the major players in the market, and banks. This is not yet the case in Zambia. Obviously, the government and the Bank of Zambia are making efforts to go in this direction, but banks are not."" While there may not be any silver bullet, there is a silver lining. More banks are working hard to improve their SME lending portfolio. Finally, it appears that the key to unlocking the potential of Zambia's SMEs is ICTs, which many ISPs and telecoms companies in Zambia have quickly cottoned on to, starting the ball rolling with competitive solutions customized for this market. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The public and private sectors are aware of how much the country would stand to gain, both economically and socially, if the SME segment was propelled onto a growth trajectory akin to that of larger corporates.","","SME Growth","good-things-come-in-small-packages","3571","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-03T11:14:00.000Z","2017-07-03T11:14:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Adding it All Up","<p>There are five main pillars to the program. The first targets fiscal policy, aiming to better administrate the collection of taxes to improve revenue inflows. The second seeks to channel more public money into social protection, in particular pension schemes, so as to dampen the effects of austerity for the most financially challenged. The third aims to reduce inefficient public spending, with stricter regulations and more transparency in budgetary decisions, as well as harsher penalties for those caught abusing the system. The fourth focuses on improving budget planning to bolster government creditability. The fifth and final concerns monetary policy: easing access to credit, lowering lending rates, and reducing inflation.  </p><p>This proposed economic boot camp could not be more timely. At the end of 2016, Zambia's economy was reporting growth of just 3%, considerably down on the rate of 7% ostensibly required to overcome nationwide inequalities and eliminate poverty. Furthermore, Zambia has suffered from a fiscal deficit for the last 10 years, a deficit that has grown from 1.6% of GDP in 2011 to 10% at the end of 2016. It is commonly held that considerable fuel and electricity subsidies were paramount in creating such a shortfall, and in early October 2016 the government made the bold move of discontinuing fuel subventions, increasing pump prices on diesel, petrol and kerosene for the first time since mid-2015. </p><p>However, since then, audit reports have revealed that unplanned, unauthorized spending on the part of ministries, provinces, and other governmental bodies accounted for a far larger percent of the deficit than any subsidy. Untouched expenditures, irregular payments, and undelivered materials amounted to USD72 million. These values represented 3.3% and 4% of the overall deficit, while electricity subsidies accounted for just 2.1%.<br>In light of this, Zambia Plus's third pillar seems all the more significant. As the National Secretary of the Economics Association of Zambia Herryman Moono told TBY, “One of the key elements of the economic recovery program is budget credibility. For the past five years, this has come under question, and our current deficit is the result of a lack of credible budget.“ According to Mutati's statements at the Budget Address, Zambia Plus will see the full implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) by the end of 2017. In theory, the obligatory use of the online data entry system for all government budgetary activities will put a stop to financial mismanagement and internal corruption. </p><p>The fifth pillar has also sparked some enthusiasm from Zambian businesses. When he introduced Zambia Plus, Mutati stated that “In 2017, monetary policy will remain focused on maintenance of price and financial system stability in order to support restoration of macroeconomic stability and growth.“ It is hoped that a consistent monetary policy, as well one that is aligned with fiscal policy, will help ensure economic stability, as well as raise confidence for sustained private-sector investment. </p><p>An IMF mission came to Zambia in late 2016, and concluded that there would be no bail-out until certain conditions were met, including reducing the fiscal deficit and limiting the accruing of public debt. The measures implemented prior to and as a result of Zambia Plus will go some way to contributing to these provisos. Elsewhere, the international community has applauded the program, with several EU member states and the UK issuing statements in support of the plans. However, in its eight Zambia Economic Brief, published in 2016, the World Bank expressed concerns regarding the government's commitment to austerity, underscoring the fact that as per the reform public expenditure is due to increase to ZMK61.4 billion from ZMK50.4 billion in 2016. </p><p>These views serve as a reminder that there is always a risk of discrepancy between what is put down on paper, and what is carried out in practice. Whether or not this increased governmental spending is an investment that will pay off and whether or not the recovery program will bring a much desired plus to the Zambian economy remains to be seen. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zambia Plus","adding-it-all-up","3067","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-03T07:16:00.000Z","2017-07-03T07:16:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Keystone","<p>With its economic, political, and geographical advantages, Zambia is a key member of regional communities and is set to play an ever-more instrumental role in intercontinental initiatives in the coming years. This is evident in its commitment to supporting certain regional integration programs spearheaded by the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD). Zambia has been a member of the AU since 1964, COMESA since 1981, and NEPAD since 2013, and was one of the founding members of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), the predecessor to the SADC, established in Lusaka in 1980. Zambia has played an active role in all of these groupings, promoting and exemplifying major attributes of the collectives' mandate and signing up to their key initiatives.</p><p>Zambia's involvement in the AU grew in January 2017 when Albert Muchanga was named commissioner for the AU Commission for Trade and Industry. In addition, perhaps spurred by its landlocked nature, Zambia has been steadfast in its quest to work with the rest of Africa to expedite some of the AU's linkages programs. One such program is the African Highway project, designed to ensure infrastructure connectivity by road when completed by 2030. Similarly, Zambia is pushing for better connectivity via air and sea by 2025 and by rail by 2040. It is among the number of countries that will greatly benefit from in-country connectivity to the Africa Integrated High Speed Railway Network (AIHSRN), due for completion by the year 2063. </p><p>The AIHSRN is proposed to comprise 11 different routes, stretching the length and width of the entire continent. Lusaka is serviced by two of these lines: one reaching west to east, from Lobito to Beira, and the other north to south, from Cairo to Cape Town. Zambia has also been singled out as one of the countries in which components of the AIHSRN will be manufactured, with the collaboration of the Chinese government, at TAZARA Mpika. In order for construction to take place, the AU has given the green light on a series of refurbishments to the TAZARA facilities.</p><p>Further to this, the representative for Zambia to the AU, Susan Sikaneta, revealed to TBY that “a regional training institute that will be established in Mpika will offer courses from certificate to PhD levels and will accordingly benefit Zambians alongside other students drawn from the region.</p><p>NEPAD, meanwhile, was the result of a decision by the AU to merge the Millennium Africa Recovery Plan (MAP) with the Omega plan for Africa. In June 2001, the UN laid out the framework for the New African Initiative (NAI), which was finalized by the OAU six months later and christened NEPAD. Its chief objectives are to: strengthen internal regional networks of infrastructure and trade; encourage advances in industrialization, technology, and innovation; better manage natural resources and increase food security; and develop human capital. More concrete goals include maintaining an average GDP growth rate of over 7% per annum for the next decade and a half, particularly stressing the sustainable nature of these rates.</p><p>Zambia has signed up to several of NEPAD's initiatives, including the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), the Presidential Infrastructure Champion Initiative (PICI), and Africa Power Vision, focusing on the energy sector. </p><p>Some Zambian projects that have been launched as a result include the construction of an 8,000km transmission line system that stretches from Egypt through to South Africa, the initiative “Single African Sky“ that will create a high-level satellite-based air navigation system for the continent, and a Zambia-Angola rail and road link. </p><p>Past successes of the AU, SADC, COMESA, and NEPAD reflect just how much can be achieved through regional integration in Africa. Further such activities are critical to the realization of Agenda 2063, triggering and promoting development in diverse areas at both the continental and national levels. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Regional integration","the-keystone","3677","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-07-03T07:10:00.000Z","2017-07-03T07:10:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Fine Balance","<p>After a decade of strong growth that saw its GDP peak at USD28.045 billion in 2013, Zambia saw difficult years in 2015 and 2016 due to a number of economic factors. Decreased demand for the nation's primary mineral exports resulted in cascading issues that have led to fiscal issues and declining GDP growth. Still, Zambia is widely considered to have some of the highest economic potential in Sub-Saharan Africa thanks to its natural resources, political stability, and openness to foreign investment. Recent projects have begun the process of creating the infrastructure and fiscal stability needed to develop a more robust economy able to add value to the nation's natural resources. It will be a lengthy process, but Zambia's international relationships should help forge the knowledge transfers needed to push the nation's economy to the next level.</p><h4>KEY FIGURES</h4><p>Like many other African nations, Zambia's economy is largely predicated on the extraction of its natural resources. Mining is the country's most important industry; copper exports make up some 80% of Zambia's foreign earnings, and cobalt, silver, and precious stones are all extracted in large amounts. The bulk of this goes to China, which receives over a quarter of all Zambian exports. Mining revenue grew from ZMK7.6 billion in 2013 to ZMK7.7 billion in 2013 and ZMK8.8 billion in 2014, but dropped 9% in 2015. Although production rose from 708,259 tons in 2014 to 710,860 tons in 2015, falling global demand—particularly from China—drove prices down 23%. As a result, GDP growth fell to 2.92%, well below the 7.7% growth that was the average from 2000-2010. 2016 growth remained at approximately this rate of 3%, but an IMF regional economic report in late 2016 projected that Zambia's GDP would rise slightly to 4% in 2017, then to 4.2% in 2018. While still below the 7% figure that is needed to continue reducing poverty rates, this is a step in the right direction for an economy that has taken more than its fair share of knocks over the past few years.</p><h4>FISCAL ISSUES </h4><p>One of the largest economic issues facing Zambia right now is the fiscal issues that have come about as a result of the fall in mining-related exports. After a decade of strength, the kwacha dropped by 50% against the USD in 2015, making it Africa's worst-performing currency. The corresponding higher price of imported goods led to rising inflation, and despite government efforts Zambia saw inflation rise from 7.9% in 2014 to 21% in 2015 and 19% in 2016. At its peak in February 2016, Zambia saw inflation reach 22.9%, leading to international concerns about the stability of the nation's economic program. In an attempt to curtail inflation, the Bank of Zambia raised the policy rate from 12.5% to 15.5% in 2015. This bit of monetary policy has been largely successful in accomplishing the central bank's primary goal of cutting the inflation rate to single digits and lowering the prices of essential consumer items such as food and vehicles, but the higher policy rate has raised borrowing costs, limiting the access to credit needed for investment and growth. Well aware of the challenging balancing act it must undertake, the Bank of Zambia announced in late February 2017 that the policy rate would decrease from 15.5% to 14%, citing the fact that inflation has further slowed from 7.5 to 7% as of January 2017. The hope is that this increases the flow of credit in the economy.</p><p>Zambia is also dealing with increased fiscal deficits that came about due to its contracting economy. High levels of public investment combined with flagging revenues have pushed spending well above the level that revenues can support, leading to concerns about the health of the nation's accounts balance. Since 2010, Zambia's public expenditures have increased at an average of 13.8% yearly, reaching 28.1% of GDP in 2015. In tandem, fiscal deficits have risen from 1.8% of GDP in 2011 to 5.5% of GDP in 2014 and 9.4% of GDP in 2015. The deficit remained at about 10% of GDP in 2016, but the Zambian government proposed measures to close the deficit late in the year, and has stated that it hopes to reduce the gap to 7% of GDP in 2017. This comes in the midst of growing international concern about the country's economic system; investors and global financial organizations have criticized the Zambian government for not making the necessary expenditure adjustments quickly enough when revenues failed to meet expectations.</p><p>In an effort to alleviate investor concerns, Zambia's ZMK64.5 billion 2017 budget should bring strong fiscal consolidation policies and monetary reforms aimed at balancing the nation's budget sheet. The budget calls for domestic borrowing to be limited to 2% of GDP and increase revenue to 18% of GDP. At the same time Zambian government officials recognize that the country still has significant social expenditure needs, so the 2017 budget eschews the austerity programs that some international officials were calling for and increases total expenditure from ZMK50.4 billion to ZMK61.4 billion. This includes increases in education spending (ZMK9.1 billion to ZMK10.6 billion), health spending (ZMK4.4 billion to ZMK5.8 billion) and agriculture, which saw the Farmers Input Support Program budget increased by 160%. While public debt remains an issue that the government is dedicated to cutting, the 2017 budget reflects the belief that spending is still required to generate the growth that will alleviate Zambia's fiscal issues.</p><h4>ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAMS</h4><p>These budgetary questions have taken center stage due to the Economic Recovery Program that Zambia has recently launched in order to right its economic ship. Announced by the Minister of Finance in October 2016, the plan has five central pillars: fiscal sustainability, increasing social protection, cutting waste, improving budget credibility, and promoting economic stability by reducing constraints to private sector development. The 2017 budget represents the first steps taken toward this goal, and the Zambian government is in the midst of delivering further reforms that will prevent waste and increase efficiency. One action already taken was the acquisition of a USD50 million line of credit from the African Development Bank to set up an SME lending program. More than 70% of Zambia's GDP and 88% of all employment in Zambia comes from SMEs, and Zambian officials hope to support over 1,000 SMEs with the program, increasing employment, strengthening infrastructure, and creating a more diverse economy.</p><p>Also on the horizon is a potential aid program with the IMF. In late 2016, Zambian government officials held talks with the global monetary organization, which has previously stated that the country's budget deficit is a concern. The IMF has supported Zambia's fiscal consolidation efforts and believes that a well-structured aid program could bring new confidence to global markets. Discussions are still ongoing, but Zambian officials have stated that they expect to reach an agreement within the first half of 2017. Further fiscal consolidation would likely be at the core of any IMF deal, as recent debt sustainability studies conducted by the IMF and World Bank have analysts concerned about Zambia's ability to meet its debt obligations. Of particular concern are Zambia's Eurobonds, which mature between 2022 and 2077.

Of the world's nations currently receiving migrants, just 87 have established resettlement programs. Some call this subdued response a global failure to mitigate the devastating social and economic effects of mass displacement.</p><p>Championed for many years as a stronghold of peace in the southern African region, Zambia now looks to take on a new role, with an innovative integration policy that sets an example to other nations across the globe. It has long been a host to refugees from neighboring African states, including Angola, Rwanda, the DRC, Burundi, Mozambique, and Somali. Since the 1950s, the country has welcomed with open arms those seeking asylum from war-torn and economically challenged countries. Many of these early refugees have since received Zambian permits or married Zambian nationals and are bringing up their children side by side with Zambian families.</p><p>In recent years, successful integration has been facilitated by a three-year local integration program (2013-2016). Following an agreement struck up between the Zambian, Angolan, and Rwandan governments, displaced persons from these two countries were able to settle formally on Zambian soil and obtain Zambian residency permits. Under this regulation, 18,685 Angolans and some 4,000 Rwandans were given residence permits and at the end of November 2016, 841 plots of land had been allocated to Angolans. In 2016, the UNHCR Zambia was working with an operational budget of USD6.4 million. Of this, USD3.8 million was designated for local integration activities. The total contribution of Zambia to refugee resettlement has never actually been calculated; however, given that the project has been ongoing since 2013, with funds continually channeled towards equipping the areas with basic facilities, it is estimated to be considerable. Donations from the US government to help refugees in Zambia in 2015 totaled USD2.9 million, of which USD1.5 million was earmarked specifically for resettlement schemes. Other donors included Germany, which has been instrumental in the funding of borehole drilling in the areas, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Japanese Association of Aid and Relief. In December 2016 this program came to an end, replaced in 2017 by the long-term Sustainable Resettlement concept. Two main settlement areas, Mayukwayukwa and Meheba, were redesigned in line with this initiative: half of each area became a designated refugee camp, with plots of land available to any registered asylum seeker; and the other half, a designated resettlement scheme, home to both Zambians and former Angolan or Rwandan refugees who had and have applied for integration.</p><p>The quest for an effective method to enable the shift from humanitarian interventions to long-term sustainable development for dealing with cases of protracted displacement is longstanding. The Program of Sustainable Resettlement, jointly conceived and developed by the Zambian government and the United Nations in Zambia, can be viewed as a primary vehicle that points to the country's successful transition in its dealings with displaced people from humanitarian relief to a developmental approach. The program has the aim of both meeting the high ambitions and standards of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and also supporting the local integration of former Angolan and Rwandan refugees in Zambia into their new communities.</p><p>There are some similar programs being tested elsewhere in Africa, in Liberia and Tanzania for example; however, these do not have the same thorough application processes and long-term structures as Zambia's approach. In its infancy, Zambia's pilot program seeks further funding in order to be able to implement the final stages. Because of this, it is difficult to state the impact the program will have on the global displacement crisis, as well as on Zambia's long-term development and economic growth. However, it cannot be denied that well-planned integration of people is a step in the right direction toward boosting human capacity potential and the country's levels of productivity. What is more, the country's resettlement program, providing financing levels are reached so that the project can be seen through to conclusion, could be a worthwhile model for other nations worldwide seeking solutions to their respective refugee crises. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","With the world facing a mass population displacement crisis, the likes of which have not been seen since World War II, Zambia is becoming a somewhat unlikely torch-bearer in the global move to re-integrate millions of people of concern.","","Resettlement","safe-haven","3098","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, while it managed to evade (local) man-made disasters, it still has to deal with the wrath of mother nature and, for a country overly dependent upon commodity exports, the tyranny of blind market forces. As the second-largest copper producer in Africa and the eighth largest in the world, Zambia remains critically over-dependent upon the metal: it relies on copper for 70% of its foreign currency reserves and 30% of total government revenue. And the last two years have not been kind to copper. </p><p>With China accounting for 40% of the metal's global consumption, any slowdown in the middle kingdom causes serious ruptures in the Zambian economy and, by extension, politics and society. Indeed, one metric found it was the country most exposed to fluctuations in the Chinese economy in the entirety of Africa. And though the country experienced unprecedented growth starting around 2000, growing on average 6.4% between 2005 and 2015, a falloff in demand from China combined with a domestic energy crisis fueled by poor water management led to the massive decline of the price of copper, the momentary closure of several of the country's largest mines (the Anglo-Swiss conglomerate Glencore's mine in Mopani and the Chinese-owned Luanshya Copper Mines at Baluba), and the near-collapse of the country's currency, the kwacha. </p><p>With the sad distinction of being Africa's worst-performing currency in 2015, President Edgar Lungu, first elected in January 2015 following the unexpected death of his predecessor, Michael Sata, found himself forced to take drastic measures to save the kwacha from further erosion. Thus he issued a sovereign bond in July 2015 that helped raise USD7 billion toward plugging the hole in foreign currency reserves and government revenue. In combination with further belt-tightening by the Zambian central bank, this helped stave off further decline of the kwacha—but it significantly increased the country's public debt to GDP ratio.</p><p>As a result of these tumultuous economic trials, the country has been forced to reevaluate several of its longstanding diplomatic, geopolitical, and philosophical positions in the region. Though far from a continental powerhouse, the country has taken a strong stand on various issues over the years, not in the least its support for the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and its chief political-military advocate, the Polisario Front, against the Kingdom of Morocco in those parties' claims to represent the legitimate government of the Western Sahara. </p><p>In February 2016 President Lungu made an unsuspected move when he decided to recognize the independence of Western Sahara and accuse Morocco of colonizing another African country. This came in addition to several pointed criticisms that Lungu had made of Morocco for purportedly turning its back on Africa in its desire to establish closer ties with Europe by attempting to join, among others, the European Economic Community. “I wish to assure you,"" he reassured Western Sahara's ambassador to Zambia Salam El-Mami in February 2016, “of our relentless collective calls for the independence of the people of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.""<br>In December 2016, the king of Morocco repaid the favor by canceling last minute that monarchy's first-ever planned visit to Zambia, a move that led to much speculation. Then in January 2017, with the ball back in Lungu's court, he returned the volley by inviting the president (in exile) of the Sahrawi Republic, Brahim Ghali, to Zambia. During their meeting, Lungu told his “counterpart"": “We are truly behind Sahrawi for the emancipation of the country and its people."" He added to that by reiterating the unity of the African continent and reprimanding those “northern"" parts of the continent that sought further concurrence with Europe.<br>The point, it would seem, had been made more than clearly enough. Zambia and its president were not only standing by the only member of the African Union, the Sahrawi Republic, not to enjoy internationally recognized (or real-life appreciated) sovereignty; they were working to isolate the one African country, Morocco, which did not enjoy membership in the African Union. Having left what was then the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1984 to protest that body's acceptance of the Sahrawi Republic, Morocco spent the next 33 years in the (relative) diplomatic wilderness.</p><p>All that changed in February 2017 when King Mohammed VI paid an unexpected trip to Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. In an abrupt volte-face, Lungu had a change of heart (as a result, it would seem, of a literally good change of fortune) and recognized Morocco's claims over Western Sahara. Hosting the first visit of a Moroccan head of state to Zambia, Lungu also oversaw the signing of 19 partnership agreements between Morocco and Zambia.</p><p>Accompanying the Moroccan king were that country's ministers of housing and urban policy; agriculture and fisheries; tourism, industry, trade, investment, and digital economy; energy, mines, water and environment; and health. Several civilian and military figures also accompanied the royal entourage. But the move was more than a bilateral warming of ties; coming just on the heels of Morocco's reentry into the African Union (January 30), it was also a “hearts-minds-and-wallets"" extravaganza in which the kingdom rewarded regional allies for what had been a controversial process of gaining re-admittance into the continental club.</p><p>After all, Zambia and Lungu in particular were forced to go against the explicit wishes of their largest trading partner, South Africa, in backing Morocco's reentry into the club (without relinquishing its claims on Western Sahara). But though South Africa accounts for one-third of Zambia's imports, they aren't forking over the nitrogenous fertilizers for free. In return for cash and, presumably, knowledge, the newfound friendship with Morocco works in both countries' favors: Morocco gets a vocal ally that relinquishes its long-time opposition to Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara, while Zambia gets much-needed cash flows in a time of acute economic turmoil.</p><p>As if to prove his metaphysical as well as diplomatic independence, Lungu has also changed tack on the Israeli-Palestinian question. Though an unsuspected source of diplomatic inspiration for the millennium's thorniest issue, Zambia's newfound commitment to Israel is in line with the rest of Lungu's diplomacy: known as the confound-and-collect blitzkrieg, it is a nuanced form of statecraft that backs the least-popular side in a controversial conflict. In return for its independence of spirit and ability to think outside the box, Zambia's diplomatic support is rewarded by its weight in gold and expertise.</p><p>A deft maneuver, it already seems to be paying off. Opening the first Zambian Embassy in Tel Aviv in 2015, the Zambian president was warmly received by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February 2017 to discuss commercial and knowledge transfers between the two countries. Bringing a bevy of ministers with him to discuss agriculture, water, education, security, and anti-terrorism with their Israeli counterparts, Lungu's mission seems likely to cement a fruitful and long-term friendship.</p><p>Netanyahu, for his part, expressed Israel's pleasure that Zambia was opening both a Jewish history museum and a synagogue in Lusaka. To bolster the friendship, he said, “We hope to send our experts to help with alternative energy, with water, and other areas."" In return, Zambia has agreed to buck the trend in the African Union and advocate for the renewal of Israel's observer status, a position it lost in the organization (and which Palestine enjoys) in 2002. If successful on both accounts of increasing knowledge, capital, and energy-related transfers and efficiently lobbying for peripheral players within the African Union (in this case Morocco and Israel), Zambia will have taken an important step in offsetting its dependence on copper and the fluctuations of the Chinese economy with shrewd diplomatic legerdemain.</p><p>Closer to home, Zambia has also been boosting relations with regional partners in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), an integrated economic market of 15 neighboring countries whose total market is 294 million inhabitants. Though historically good, ties with Uganda in particular have been bolstered during President Lungu's first and now second term. In 2016 the two countries agreed to open embassies in each of the other's respective capital to replace the High Commissioners that previously carried out such duties. Yet even more important was the announcement in July 2016 that plans were underfoot to build an oil pipeline from Uganda to transport crude from recently discovered fields (whose management France's Total recently acquired) to Zambia's Indeni oil refinery in the latter's Copperbelt province. </p><p>While Lungu remains on close personal terms with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, he also partook in a diplomatic blitzkrieg across Africa in the autumn of 2016 that took him to Madagascar, Morocco, Equatorial Guinea, and Tanzania in November and Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt in December. Part of Lungu's prerogative in doing so was to gain Zambia observer status in the Northern Corridor Transit and Transportation Coordination Authority, a transit agreement between the land-locked countries of Uganda, Burundi, and Rwanda, on the one hand, and Kenya, on the other, whereby the former gain access to the port of Mombasa on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast.</p><p>Though Lungu came under fire at home for spending so much time abroad in the wake of his August reelection, on several occasions being unfavorably compared to Tanzanian President Magufuli—a man who “eschews foreign travel to fix his country's domestic problems""—it is clear that Zambia cannot isolate itself from the international community, either. Rather, as Lungu seems to have intuited, it must diversify its connections, acquaintances, and mutual obligations. Only by doing so will it overcome to the economic—and hence geopolitical—isolation that comes from being overly dependent upon one lone commodity and a single export destination.</p><p>Not only can Zambia afford to take certain diplomatic gambles (as it has with Morocco and Israel) if it is to bring its people up from dire poverty, under which 60% of the country's population currently beleaguers, it must. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/ecb4ed30-c1bd-4de7-8e2e-7d244a785242.jpg","","","","Squeezed between a rock and a rather hard place by the slowdown in Chinese demand for copper, by far Zambia's biggest export and government-revenue generator, President Lungu has been forced to get creative in his country's alliances to broaden revenue streams and lessen its dependence on the vagaries of one foreign market.","","","convoke-confound-collect","3769","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Africa > Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under this law, banks in Lebanon are committed to absolute secrecy. A bank account cannot be disclosed to private entities or public authorities—whether judicial, administrative, financial, or military—except in certain cases.</p><p>This law has helped to attract domestic and foreign capital, encouraged investment, and provided confidence in bank credit, positively reflecting on the climate of economic stability in Lebanon. Between 1950 and 1961, Lebanon saw a 467% increase in deposits. The number of Lebanese banks increased from 31 in 1955 to 72 in 1968. Bank deposits continued also to increase significantly during and after the civil war, spanning 1975-1990. According to the Tax Justice Network's Financial Secrecy Index, Lebanon has historically had a large offshore financial sector, and this sector has developed to cater to Arab countries and the large Lebanese diaspora. Lebanon's banking secrecy law places it in the top-10 globally for most financially secret economies.</p><p>But, the banking secrecy law in Lebanon has received several blows in recent years, causing it to lose many of its advantages. In 2015 and 2016, several laws were issued to challenge the banking secrecy law, the most important of them being the American tax compliance law. The Foreign Account Compliance Tax Act (FACTA) is a US law that requires foreign banks and financial institutions to periodically provide the IRS with information about clients who are tax-deductible. This law directly opposes Lebanon's banking secrecy law, forcing Lebanon to choose between enforcing its famed banking secrecy law or avoiding the repercussions of noncompliance with FACTA.</p><p>Another law inconsistent with banking secrecy practices is the Law for the Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, approved on October 27, 2016. This law authorizes the Minister of Finance to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements with any foreign country to exchange information related to tax evasion or tax fraud.</p><p>Nevertheless, the banking secrecy law remains in place, and this fact raises doubts about the integrity and transparency of the Lebanese banking system. The spread of corruption in Lebanon is largely linked to the Banking Secrecy Law, which is an obstacle to financial scrutiny of individuals and institutions. The world no longer accepts the existence of countries outside the rules of globalization and the principle of equal opportunities and fair competition. The US authorities classify tax evasion as part of the war on illegal funds.</p><p>Despite the precarious situation in the region, the Lebanese banking sector has proved that it is capable of maintaining a solid financial position, displaying the ability to absorb the pressures that it is facing and act as a hedge against unexpected crises thanks to the commitment of Lebanese banks to implementing banking legislation, international standards, and risk management.</p><p>Also, the country and the finance sector maintain an ongoing effort to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, which includes the November 2015 adoption of the Law on Fighting Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. With that, Lebanon is balancing the global pressure to tighten control over the movement of funds while simultaneously maintaining its banking secrecy.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/c207aee1-68d0-4b21-ab80-9c364f8412c5.jpg","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/headerImages/81686a8c-072e-42db-bcbb-34913ec0d36f.jpg","","Lebanon is known for its confidentiality in banking, but recent laws have put its tradition of banking secrecy at odds with the rules of the game known as globalization.","","Banking Secrecy in Beirut","globalization-could-change-once-attractive-banking-secrecy-laws-in-lebanon","6364","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > Lebanon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When said income is earned through individuals or legal entities located outside of Panama, the amount of the tax to be withheld is 50% of the amount which Panamanian-source income tax would normally be levied. Income earned either from activities or transactions performed abroad is considered to be of foreign source and therefore not taxable.<br>Income tax rates are of 25% of net taxable income for all types of business entities, with progressive income tax rates for individuals earning more than USD800 monthly. The following items are considered gross revenue of the taxpayer's overall income:<br>• Salaries, bonuses, travel allowances, commissions, and other payments for personal services, except medical insurance expenses;<br>• Proceeds or profits from business or agricultural activities;<br>• Leasing activities of any kind, interest plus proceeds from licensing of intellectual property;<br>• Dividends or share distributions;<br>• Profits earned from the sale of real or personal property, shares, bonds, and other securities;<br>• Proceeds or profits from public services such as electricity, telephone or gas;<br>• Activities of businesses operating established within free trade zones; and<br>• Any increase in personal wealth not justified within the relevant year.<br>Expenses deemed by the Tax Code as incurred for the preservation and generation of income and the protection of its source are deductible from gross income. The following are also deemed as deductible expenses or distributions:<br>• Donations to officially-designated local educational or non-profit charities up to USD50,000 (for individuals) or 1% of the donor taxable income (for entities);<br>• Dues paid to local non-profit bodies or associations or guilds;<br>• The difference between interest paid and interest earned on deposits used as collateral for loans (back-to-back loans);<br>• Employer earnings distribution among its workers; and<br>• Interest earned from Panama bank accounts.<br>Business entities with taxable annual income over USD1,500,000, are subject to Alternative Minimum Tax at the highest between 1) a rate of 25% of their net taxable income or 2) 4.67% of their gross taxable income. Individuals are levied income tax on a progressive rate: no tax for income up to USD11,000, 15% of the excess from USD11,000 to USD50,000 for incomes between USD11,000.01 and USD50,000, and USD5,850 for the initial USD50,000, plus 25% of the excess over USD50,000 for incomes over USD50,000.<br>Other taxes also applied to businesses are:<br>• ITBMS - Goods and Services Transfer Tax: applicable to delivery of all goods and services, as well as imports at a rate of 7%;<br>• ISC - Excise Tax: applicable to delivery of certain luxury goods and services (i.e. alcohol. cable TV), as well as their importation at rate of 7-15%;<br> • Real Estate Transfer Tax at rates of up to 2% payable by sellers of real estate except for the first sale of newly built improvements;<br>• Stamp Duty at USD2.50 for every USD1,000 of real estate value and at lower rates for several types of agreements<br>• Dividend Tax and Complementary Tax<br>• Business License Tax<br>Despite having been described by foreign media as a tax haven where no taxes are paid, Panama is ranked 170 in the PWC Paying Taxes Survey out of 190 economies when it comes to ease of tax compliance. Total tax rate is estimated at 37.2%, with 417 hours required to comply with 52 payments every year. Tax returns are filed online before March 15 for individual and March 30 for entities. Tax refunds may take more than a year to be approved, although written applications for tax credits take less time.<br>Panama has also engaged in international tax cooperation by entering into 19 double-taxation agreements and 10 tax-exchange information agreements, the majority of which are currently in force. Agreements have been signed with Barbados, Canada, South Korea, the UAE, Spain, Finland, France, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, Vietnam, and the UK. A US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Intergovernmental Agreements (IGA) is being enforced. Panama has not been invited to be a member of the OECD but has adopted a transfer pricing regime that basically follows the OECD transfer pricing guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations.<br>In addition to the abovementioned investment benefits, even lower tax rates as well as special labor and immigration regimes are available to companies registered in:<br>• Colón Free Trade Zone of the Atlantic side for warehousing of foreign goods and their re-exportation to foreign markets;<br>• Panama Pacific Economic Area;<br>• Export Processing Zones for companies involved in maquila operations and outsourcing for foreign markets;<br>• Multinational Headquarters Regime for regional offices of international business groups with capital above USD500 million worldwide;<br>• City of Knowledge Regime for educational and research &amp; development facilities; and<br>• National Tourism Registry for lodging structures and—when in special tourism zones—restaurants and tourist entertainment facilities.<br>A number of business sectors are subject to increased compliance and due diligence measures in order to identify ultimate beneficiaries of their clients and must report any suspicious activity, when not covered by professional confidentiality laws, in order to avoid use of their services to prevent money laundering, the financing of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These regulated businesses are law firms, pawn shops, real estate brokerages, factoring companies, leasing agencies, credit card or e-money issuing agencies, businesses in free trade zones, casinos, construction companies, custodians of bearer shares and bonds, money transfer agencies, dealers of precious metals and other bullion; jewelry dealers; saving and loans societies.<br>Monthly reports in specific formats must be provided regularly by these regulated businesses. Upon receipt of lists issued by the United Nations Security Council for preventive freeze of assets, a report must be issued immediately on whether said assets are held. Failure to comply with these compliance provisions are subject to fines of up to USD1 million.</p><h4>Investment protection</h4><p>Proper legal advice is essential to have in place before entering into an agreement to avoid litigation and improve a position in case of a dispute. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index 2015-2016 report ranks the independence of Panama's judicial system 119 out of 140 countries. According to the US State Department Investment Climate Statement (ICS) 2016, there are frequent claims of bias and favoritism in the court system and complaints about the lack of adequate titling, inconsistent regulations, and a lack of trained officials outside of Panama City. The ICS reports that politically connected businesses have benefited from court decisions, and there have been allegations that judges have “slow-rolled“ dockets for years without taking action. Resolving disputes through the Panamanian court system can take years, depending on the issue, the location, the court calendar or the judge. There are often reports of corruption, bribery, inconsistent treatment, and a lack of transparency.<br>Many foreign investors rely on binding international or local arbitration clauses to resolve disputes and avoid litigation before the court system. Although foreign and local arbitral awards are subject to nullification in case violations of the Panama arbitration law or lack of service, the Supreme Court has a track record better than other courts in the region for upholding awards. Panama is a member of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and party to the 1958 New York and 1975 Panama Conventions on arbitration.<br>Free trade agreements have been implemented by Panama with Canada, Chile, El Salvador, Peru, the EU, the European Free Trade Association, Mexico, and the US, as well as a partial scope agreement with Cuba. Bilateral Investment Treaties with the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Qatar, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan enhance investment protection for citizens of those countries by ensuring national treatment and providing arbitration for resolution of treaty disputes. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legal","all-the-details-panama-2017","1577","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-23T11:34:00.000Z","2017-06-23T11:34:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","BUSINESS  AS USUAL","<p>Largely known for being the hub of the Americas, its canal, and its ease of doing business, Panama continues to go from strength to strength. The country jumped an impressive eight spots in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017, moving up from 50 to 42 out of a total of 138 countries. It is second only to Chile in the region (ranked 33rd) and leads Latin America in terms of its macroeconomic environment, the efficiency of its goods market, its financial market development, and level of business sophistication. Among the advantages of doing business in Panama, respondents from the World Bank's Executive Opinion Survey cited its foreign currency regulations, stable government, the lack of inflation, and stable policies as the top factors, while corruption, inefficient government bureaucracy, and an inadequately educated workforce were cited as the top issues facing businesses there. Indeed, Panama has much to do to improve its reputation in the wake of the Panama Papers and Waked scandals.</p><p>The country was largely built upon the tenets of international trade and commerce, business-friendly initiatives, and a growing reputation as the region's business hub, and it continues to enhance its global and regional prominence though trade liberalization and free trade agreements (it can also add double taxation treaties to that list thanks to recent efforts). The vast majority of its economic activity—almost 80% of GDP—is based on its services sector, which includes the canal, activities in the Colón Free Trade Zone, banking, container ports, and flagship registry. With the completion of the USD5.25 billion expansion of the canal in 2016, it has become more viable to ship cargo from Asia directly to the east coast of the US instead of the west coast. In addition, Panama has had to introduce better container handling, truck scheduling, and container sequencing to minimize wait times and cost. With the increase in shipping volumes, more and larger cargo will almost certainly jumpstart economic activity in the maritime sectors as well as in logistics, infrastructure, services, energy, and tourism. The expansion of the canal has also benefited the country's Colón Free Zone (CFZ), a key trading and transshipment center serving the region and the world that resells, repackages, and reships imports from around the world to regional markets. It is the second-largest free zone in the world, there are over 2,000 companies either represented or operating in CFZ, and 92% of Panama's exports and 64% of its imports—estimated to be worth USD20 billion—go through the zone annually. Tocumen Airport is Panama's main airport and the largest transfer hub in the region, where major airlines serve 73 destinations in 30 countries, with the number of direct flights growing every day. The main Panamanian airline, Copa Airlines, offers about 355 flights to 69 destinations in North, Central, and South America, and the Caribbean.<br>Panama is heavily dependent on foreign investment, and the government actively promotes Panama as a first-rate place to do business in, working hard to ensure the investment process is smooth and attractive for investors. There are almost no distinctions between domestic and foreign companies for investment purposes, and there is support and advice provided at all stages of the process of opening an office in the country. Establishing an office in Panama is a straightforward process, as its legal framework is one of the most modern and flexible in Latin America. Laws were also recently enacted to make it easier for foreigners to relocate to Panama. There are numerous tax advantages for international businesses located there, and more than 400,000 companies are registered in Panama. The country's low crime rate, tropical climate, modest personal tax rates, and competitive educational and healthcare systems also make Panama an attractive destination for expatriate executives, particularly those with families. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOING BUSINESS","business-as-usual","1309","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-23T10:08:00.000Z","2017-06-23T10:08:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Technical Advancement","<p>There are many challenges for doing business in Panama: Along with governmental bureaucracy that stifles entrepreneurs and businesses and a certain dearth of institutionalization at several levels, the lack of a highly specialized workforce has been identified as one of the main obstacle to successfully develop a business in Panama. President Varela's government, along with the support of the Competitiveness &amp; Logistics Secretariat, designed Instituto Técnico Superior del Este (ITSE) based on the model of similar technical schools that have been already successfully developed in the UK, Germany, and Singapore. ITSE will allow for the development of qualified professional profiles to meet the increasing demand of qualified workers coming from several segments of the national economy, both from the private and public sector. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Miguel Angel Esbrí¬, National Secretary of Competitiveness &amp; Logistics Secretariat, stressed the pivotal and crucial importance of such projects for the solid development of the national economy: “With the joint efforts in terms of the lack of highly qualified workforce, we coordinate activities with the Ministry of Labor and other such institutions. We plan during our term in office to create over 120,000 new positions and train more than 232,000 people. Additionally, we have established the country's first technical and professional school in the country (ITSE).“</p><p>The new ITSE will attract all the students who for academic, social, or economic reasons do not have access to the traditional existing network of universities and are in need of a job. With the ITSE, Panama will witness a new generation of young professionals with a solid and competitive technical background in the fields of logistics, languages, construction, communications, business administration, health, environment, tourism, hospitality, and engineering.</p><p>In order to attract students from all over, an appealing environment, a state-of-the-art technological infrastructure, and a modern facility will characterize the new technical institute that will be completely aligned with the vision and mandate of International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN specialized agency that seeks to promote social justice and internationally recognized human and labor rights. As Angel Esbrí¬ noted, “Companies arriving here face a lack of technically qualified human resources in certain areas. At the same time, certain companies have also raised concerns over the lack of soft skills in people. We can see the consequences of this: in most customer-facing jobs such as in the hospitality industry, we have people from other nationalities working there. The development of these technical schools is in response to the needs and concerns of companies operating in Panama.“</p><p>All the classes and the short courses—comprising one or two years—at ITSE will be taught in English and Spanish; they will be based on the concept of both practical learning—making up 70% of the total syllabus—and theoretical learning, which will account for 30%. The students enrolled at ITSE will have the option to spend the last months of their courses working as trainees in several national and international companies that have based their operation in the country.</p><p>With a total investment of more than USD200 million from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Cooperación Andina de Fomento (CAF), the development bank of Latin American, Panama's first technical institute will be located in Tocumen. It will be serviced by the new, expanded Metro and is strategically built close to Corredor Sur and to the international airport. Based on the government's vision, the new technical school will be fully operational starting from January 2019 and will be able to accommodate approximately 5,000 students, who will be taught by 250 high-profile and qualified teachers and professors. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ITSE","technical-advancement","1458","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The country is dubbed the hub of the Americas and has a great logistical position, with direct flights to the US, Europe, and other destinations. The latest Global Meetings &amp; Event Forecast prepared by American Express Meeting &amp; Events ranks Panama City third among Latin American cities in terms of hosting meetings and events, just behind Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in first place and Cancún, Mexico, in second place. As part of efforts to capitalize on Panama's privileged geographical location between the two Americas, both the government and the private sector have been investing heavily in the business and conferences tourism segment to further develop this booming segment.</p><p>Panama City currently has in its portfolio Atlapa Convention Center, which can accommodate 10,500 attendees for medium-sized international conventions, conferences, and events, which is much lower than the needs of the MICE market. The city has, therefore, taken key steps and is in the midst of upgrading and improving its infrastructure in a bid to better serve the MICE sector. The Panama Tourism Authority (ATP), following its Master Plan for Sustainable Tourism Development 2007-2020, is working together with the private sector to promote Panama as a key destination for both leisure travel as well as for MICE at important fairs and congresses around the world such as FITUR in Madrid, ITB in Berlin, IMEX in Germany, and WTM in Dubai.<br>In 2016, the budget managed by the ATP was USD91.925 billion. The most significant project has been the construction of the Amador Convention Center (CCA), considered the largest in the country and region. Built at a cost of USD193.7 million, the building has a total area of 58,000sqm, of which approximately 30,000sqm has been set aside for an exhibition hall, conference facilities, and a banquet hall. The complex will also have a grand plaza, outdoor amphitheater, and 1,500-seat performing arts theater with balcony and box seating. The center can accommodate up to a maximum of 25,000 people and will feature a parking area with room for 1,700 vehicles. The opening of the CCA is scheduled for 2018, and the center will help Panama become one of the leading business hubs in Latin America, as will the expansion of Tocumen International Airport. As a result of the promotional efforts of the ATP at fairs around the world for the new convention center, companies from Europe and the US have shown great interest in using its facilities as the site for their major events. Among the advantages of the CCA are its proximity to main areas in the city as well as its redesign. With the opening of the CCA, the ATP expects to hold conventions and congresses every month attended by over 10,000 people.<br>In addition, the ATP and the Panama Chamber of Tourism (CAMTUR) have joined forces to set up an agency, the Panama Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is dedicated to promoting Panama as a MICE destination and will replace the previous institution responsible for both resources and responsibilities. Despite the efforts, there are still certain limitations that must be addressed in order to serve this sector properly, such as the demand for trained personnel in the segment. Another big challenge for the organization of larger events is the limited number beds in Panama City, of which there are a total of 24,000, which could impede the growth of the MICE sector in the country. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","With the opening of Amador Convention Center, along with several new marketing initiatives, Panama seeks to be the leading meetings and conventions destination in the Americas.","","MICE Tourism","meet-me-in-panama","1458","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-23T09:57:00.000Z","2017-06-23T09:57:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Progress Report","<p>Although the fast pace of economic growth has outrun Panama's education sector by a wide margin, the Ministry of Education of Panama (MEDUCA) has identified various areas for improvement. The government is currently investing approximately 3.5% of national GDP into the education sector, but the target is to raise that figure to at least 6% over the medium term in order to bring the sector back up to speed.</p><p>Panama's public education system in particular has faced challenges in recent years. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Ranking for 2016, Panama's overall rank was 50 out of 140 countries, while the quality of Panama's education system was ranked 94, notably lower compared to other measures of Panama's economy and society. In response, Panama recently expanded access to universal primary education, especially for indigenous and rural communities, where the quality of education is often negatively affected by external circumstances. For example, in 2015, only 59% of primary schools and 63% of middle schools had potable water, while 67% of primary schools and 84% of middle schools had electricity.<br>In the shadow of the massive Panama Canal expansion and the greater influx of international investors and laborers, Panama is in the process of shifting its attention away from large infrastructure development toward the betterment of educational facilities, training programs, and human capital. With recent statistics in mind, Panama's 2015-2019 Strategic Government Plan has outlined a host of investments totaling USD19.5 billion, with 55% dedicated toward social projects in education and healthcare. This is set to benefit the over 800,000 students who were enrolled at educational institutions for the 2016-2017 school year. There are five state-run universities in the country, 15 private higher education colleges, and over 30 private and public technical institutes in Panama that can also expect to receive government support in one form or another over the medium term.</p><h4>PROGRESS REPORT</h4><p>The year 2017 is expected to bring about the continuation of a number of different programs implemented by MEDUCA. The ministry currently has nearly 500 investment projects underway, including the construction of 3,871 classrooms. As well, 50 new schools for secondary education are being built in 2017, with an investment of approximately USD600 million. As part of its push to increase the quality of education facilities, the current administration is working to replace 1,000 underdeveloped rural classrooms with 1,221 smart classrooms at 248 schools, with an approximate investment of USD400 million.</p><p>A few of the programs undertaken in 2016 were “Extended School Day for All,“ which invested USD2.7 million into meals for students and an additional USD1.9 million for teachers working extended hours in 34 schools around Panama; the “Learn to the Maximum“ program, which was designed to improve the reading comprehension of 3,000 primary school students at 290 schools; and the “Panama Bilingual“ initiative, a USD20 million program to develop the skills and abilities of 3,500 educators in teaching English as a second language to over 50,000 kindergarteners and 14,000 middle schoolers. The goal for 2017 is for Panama Bilingual to train an over 2,000 more teachers and reach an additional 218 schools.</p><p>Already more than 25,000 new educators were trained in 2016, with MEDUCA's budget allowing for pay increases across the board. Approximately 3,000 teaching vacancies were filled for the 2017 semester, 890 of those positions permanent. Meanwhile, 540 new permanent teaching positions have been created in some of Panama's more inaccessible areas.</p><h4>LEARNING EXPERIENCE</h4><p>The unique economic landscape and geographic position of Panama also calls for specialized higher education institutions. Educators must be ready to provide a global education that meets international standards and taps into the potential of Panamanian youth.</p><p>Many education providers have identified the strong need for bilingual Spanish-English learning environments where students develop the language skills needed to be successful on the various multicultural careers paths available in Panama. Wendy McArthur, Executive Director of Knightsbridge Schools Panama, told TBY, “We are an English-immersion school and strongly believe in the benefits of multiple languages. We live in a global society, and if we want our children to be successful, they must know multiple languages.“ The school's proximity to the special economic zone Panama Pacifico has spurred the initiative to produce more graduates with bilingual skills. The zone is expected to increase the population in the area, as well as attract a number of international businesses and residents. In preparation for a new wave of diverse job opportunities in the area, “One of the things our school does really well is to graduate students with excellent English fluency,“ McArthur added. The future third bridge being built to connect both sides of the Panama Canal will also support Knightsbridge Schools in its efforts to attract more students, make education more accessible, and prevent long commutes.</p><p>Meanwhile, King's College the British School of Panama's Head Teacher Vanessa Whay also noted in an interview with TBY the wide spectrum of job opportunities available for students. “We will have students who may want to go into engineering, catering, or tourism. There are many opportunities for students, regardless of where they went to school or their cultural or academic background,“ she said, adding “There will be a huge market and niche that will open up huge opportunities for the workforce in the future.“ The school already boasts an impressive 60% international student body of over 30 nationalities.</p><p>For Panamanian education institutions, location is as important as curriculum and career preparation. For that reason, the City of Knowledge was established for large universities, research centers, high-tech companies, and international organizations to come together under the unifying principle of innovation in education. “Panama and the City of Knowledge offer an opportunity to reach out to the region. Panama is not only a hub for ships going through the Canal; it is a humanitarian hub and a business hub as well,“ Jorge Ramón Arosemena Román, President of the City of Knowledge, explained to TBY. “We are a bridge and in the middle of the tropics between two oceans and that means a great deal of rich biodiversity. At the City of Knowledge we work on getting Panama closer to the world.“</p><p>With an increasing number of companies moving their headquarters to Panama, human resources companies also see the country as a promising place to do business. The number of universities producing talented and skilled human capital is destined to increase the attractiveness of the local education sector as well as the pool from which companies both local and global can recruit new hires. “Panama is the hub of the Americas for several reasons; its location, financial incentives, the expanded canal, and the inflow of many investors, who all need qualified people to boost and develop their business,“ said Oscar Rodriguez, Director of Busqueda Efectiva. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Education","progress-report","1867","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pharmaceuticals industry in Panama moves more than 30 million units in the country every year, which together make up more than USD300 million. Of this total, 60% is acquired and distributed by Panama's social security fund Caja de Seguro Social (CSS), while the remainder is mainly sold in the local network of pharmacies and drugstores.</p><p>According to Colegio Nacional de Farmacéuticos de Panamá, there are 300 global pharmaceutical companies operating in Panama, distributing around 5,000 products not only within Panama but also throughout the region and beyond. Three years ago, the Contralorí­a General de la República confirmed that imports of pharmaceutical products came up to a total of USD305 million, excluding veterinary and technical medical equipment. The country, meanwhile, exported pharmaceuticals to the tune of USD19 million, the majority of which pass through the Colón Free Trade Zone. Locally, leading Panamanian pharmaceutical producers Medipan, Rigar, Lafsa, Prieto, San Rafael, and Palm are striving to compete with multinational companies such as GSK, which have identified Panama as a strategic hub to expand and consolidate their operations in Central America. “We do not just have commercial operations for pharmaceutical and consumer products based here but also a manufacturing plant that employs around 300 people,“ commented Monica Shaw, GSK cluster head. “In addition, we have a demand hub and a warehouse that supplies products to Latin America. We also have an R&amp;D hub for vaccines that runs studies for new vaccines and post introduction across the whole of Latin America. We have always had an established infrastructure within Panama; however, there are certain new facets of Panama that make it an increasingly appealing place to do business.“</p><p>Another new player in the regional market, Acino, remarked on the strategic importance of Panama to the expansion of its operation in Latin America. Stefan Bellinghausen, Regional Director Latin America at Acino, told TBY, “We are making important investments in the region, such as establishing new legal entities in Panama and Ecuador. We are also bringing in more products to the region and investing in continuous medical education. We want to extend the reach of our Swiss-based quality products across the region.

"2017-06-23T06:48:00.000Z","2017-06-22T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","MICE City","<p>According the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), in 2016 Panama's travel and tourism industry's direct contribution to the country's GDP reached USD3.7 billion, representing 6.7%. This amount reflects the economic activity generated by hotels, travel agents, airlines, and other passenger transportation services excluding commuter services, and also includes restaurants and leisure industries directly supported by tourists. The WTTC expects this amount to rise by 9.1% in 2017 to USD4.044 billion. Over the next decade, the WTTC forecasts that the sector will grow by 5.5% pa and reach USD6.891 billion in 2027, contributing to 6.6% of total GDP. The WTTC's optimistic growth forecast for 2017 reflects the expected impact of a new international promotional campaign, which will initially boost the sector's revenues and bring more stable growth results in the subsequent years.</p>
<p>The total contribution of travel and tourism to Panama's GDP includes a wider impact from investments, the supply chain, and induced consumption. This more inclusive amount was USD8.929 billion in 2016, which represents a strong 16.2% of the total GDP. The WTTC forecasts this amount to grow by 9.5% to USD9.774.2 billion and contribute to 16.7% of total GDP in 2017. Over the next decade the WTTC forecasts this amount to rise by 5.7% pa to USD16.952 billion by 2027 and contribute 16.2% of GDP.</p>
<p>An important impact of tourism on the economy is the money spent by foreign visitors, namely visitor exports, a key component of the direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP. In 2016, visitors spent USD6.196 billion, representing 22.2% of total exports for the year. Panama is expected to attract 2,321,000 international tourist arrivals in 2017, with visitors forecasted to spend 9.8% more. These are forecast to total 3,721,000 visitors in 2027, generating a revenue of USD11.342 billion, representing a 5.2% increase pa.</p>
<p>As a result of travel and tourism, 131,000 jobs were generated in 2016, representing 7.1% of total employment. The WTTC forecasts this number to grow by 5.3% in 2017 to 138,000, and contribute to 7.4% of total employment. It is forecast that travel and tourism will generate 159,000 jobs by 2027, representing an increase of 1.4% pa over the next decade. The total impact of travel and tourism to employment, including positions indirectly related to the industry, was 296,000 jobs, or 16.1% of total employment. This is forecast to rise by 5.5% to 312,500 jobs in 2017, and by 1.4% pa to 360,000 jobs in 2027, representing 16.6% of total employment.<br />Out of 185 countries, Panama was ranked 65th in terms of travel and tourism's total size and ranked 47 in terms of the relative size of the sector in total GDP. In terms of the sector's forecasted growth for 2017, Panama ranks number three, while it ranks number 42nd when it comes to the long-term growth forecast between 2017 and 2027</p>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index 2017, Panama ranks third among the most competitive Latin American countries in tourism, placing it above Costa Rica, Chile, and Argentina, reflecting its advantage in terms of geographical location and favorable environment for doing business.</p>
<h4>International Promotion</h4>
<p>Panama is not exploring the full potential of its very rich and varied tourism assets, which promise an international image beyond the famous canal. According to the Panama Tourism Authority (ATP), in 2016 the number of visitors entering Panama through the main point of entry, Tocumen International Airport, was only about 1% higher than the previous year. The number of visitors from the US, Canada, and Mexico fell significantly in 2016, whereas visitors from Europe were on the rise thanks to a perceived favorable security environment in Panama. Overall, Panama's tourism sector has suffered from the lack of an international promotional campaign since the last one ended in 2012.</p>
<p>In July 2016 a critical step was taken in this regard as the ATP awarded a USD20 million, two-year international promotion campaign contract to US company VML, Inc., an international marketing agency with offices in more than 100 countries. The company offers integrated advertising solutions, public relations, and trade marketing, among other services. The ATP also awarded a USD4.5 million two-year national promotion campaign contract to company Team Turismo 16-17, which launched a campaign in November 2016. The main targets of the international campaign will be determined according to the number of existing direct flights as well as strategic targets in the US and Europe. In January 2017, VML, Inc. launched the first stage of its tourism campaign in the form of a digital marketing program targeting 12 cities in the US, Spain, and Canada (Montreal and Toronto).</p>
<h4>Panama-Lufthansa Tourism Promotion Agreement</h4>
<p>A different kind of promotion campaign via collaboration with an airline was established in October 2016 between the ATP and Lufthansa, which entered into an agreement worth USD4 million, according to which the German airline will promote Panama for three years as a destination for European tourists in order to increase the volume of air traffic between Europe and Panama.</p>
<h4>International Tourism Promotion Fund</h4>
<p>Panama has introduced yet another measure for securing the country's long-term resources toward international promotion. In February 2017 the National Assembly approved a bill to create the International Tourism Promotion Fund to establish the financial support necessary to market Panama around the world. Sector officials see this new development as a tool that will help Panama compete with countries with similar funds such as Mexico, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. The ATP will contribute an annual amount of USD20 million to the fund, which will be partially funded by an international passenger service fee at Tocumen Airport, which is USD10 per passenger. The fund will thus be managed as a trust and include contributions from private companies and donations, in addition to public resources.</p>
<h4>The potential of the MICE Segment</h4>
<p>The ATP's strategy for the tourism industry is to offer a broad range of tourism products and experiences ranging from eco-tourism to the MICE segment. The ATP is taking action within public-private partnerships to position Panama as a leading regional destination of world-class events.</p>
<p>Deputy Director of the ATP Jennifer Champsaur told TBY in an interview: &ldquo;Thedemand for events and conferences is growing and there is a great deal of potential here. We are one of the most secure countries in the region and our hotel infrastructure and geographical position also give us an added advantage. There are five direct flights to Panama from various points in Europe that give us another window of opportunity within the MICE segment. Now, everything needs to be creative and of high quality. On the hotel side, for example, for events we have modern international hotel chains. It is also important to be innovative with the technology we provide for events.""</p>
<p>In fact, in June 2016 the ATP and the Panamanian Chamber of Tourism (CAMTUR) held the first National Tourism Convention, Juntos por Panama (CONATUR), which gathered all stakeholders in the industry with the objective of establishing a strategy to boost the country's tourism supply, notably convention tourism capacity.</p>
<h4>Infrastructure Development</h4>
<p>This strategy will be supported by important infrastructural developments that are expected to be completed within the next two years. The expansion of the Tocumen International Terminal will be completed in 2018, offering 21 gates in the new terminal. The country's main convention center, the Atlapa Convention Center will be supplemented with a new one, the Amador Convention Centre, which will be completed in 2018. According to ATP Deputy Director Champsaur, &ldquo;Amador will be a completely different and modern convention center, with more room for exhibitions. Atlapa, for example, has an amphitheater with a capacity for 2,800 people; however, there will not be a theater in the new convention center because we want it to have more space for exhibitions and larger events. The important thing with the two convention centers is the opportunity to sell Panama as a whole because Panama is not only the Panama Canal. We have culture, history, and adventure. In every single province, there are unique attractions; for example, in Chiriqu&iacute; there are mountains, beaches, and cold and hot climates in the same place.""</p>
<p>Moreover, the ATP is also focusing on developing the interior of the country, where it is planning to open another two convention centers in Chiriqu&iacute; and Herrera. Six daily flights to Chiriqu&iacute; from Panama City with Air Panama and Copa, connecting Chiriqu&iacute; to the rest of the world, suggests the opportunity that lies in this region. The tender process for the center in Chiriqu&iacute; is in the preparation phase. The center is planned to have an area of 4,000sqm and capacity for 2,000 people. According to the ATP, the center will be the country's first &ldquo;green"" wastewater management and energy saving system.</p>
<h4>Tourism Services Quality</h4>
<p>In May 2017, Panama will host the 22nd and 27th plenary meetings of the ISO TC 228 Tourism and Related Services Committee, which is the international body that oversees the quality of tourism services along international standards. The sector sees this event as an opportunity to show Panama's level of achievement in this regard. Panama, a member of the committee since 2012, introduced the Tourism Quality Certification System of Panama, or SCCT, in 2011 and it gained international recognition the same year. The ATP has recently selected about 40 hotels as part of the &ldquo;Quality Pilot Plan"" of the SCCT, to be implemented by May 2017 in concurrence with the international event.</p>
<p>Overall, Panama is certainly taking the necessary steps to boost the number of visitors and position itself as an attractive destination.</p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/a03e060d-766f-4d7e-9c49-f716a64e5594.jpg","","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/97161b04-f431-4f9b-862a-355f1a7751af.jpg","","Panama is synonymous with its tourism industry, and growth projections for the coming years suggest the sector is set to contribute more to GDP.","","Tourism sector","mice-city","1959","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-23T05:12:00.000Z","2017-06-22T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Key is Patients","<p>Panama has seen numerous positive developments in the healthcare sector over the past few years; the private sector has boosted its efforts to offer a variety of services and treatments to the local community, as well as the many expatriates who live or retire in Panama. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) has increased its healthcare budget focused on improving existing healthcare facilities, as well as adding more hospitals, equipment, and medical vehicles to the mix.</p>
<p>The 2017 budget was presented by MINSA head Dr. Miguel Mayo to the National Assembly earlier this year. At USD2.2 billion, the budget is approximately USD70 million more than in 2016. Specifically, USD73.5 million has been allocated to the renovation of existing healthcare facilities and about USD174 million was earmarked for improving the Panamanian environment as a way to improve the overall health of the population, as well as support many in their climb out of poverty. Identifying niche demands, MINSA also invested USD5 million to expand its medical vehicle fleet by 59 ambulances to reach a total of 220. As of March 2017, 50% of the 2017 government's budgeted funds had been dispersed to various segments of the healthcare sector as part of Mayo's efforts to ensure that the healthcare sector is able to exceed the achievements made in 2016. According to the latest figures provided by MINSA, the combined total of annual spending on both private and public healthcare comes to an average of USD3.7 billion.</p>
<p>Panama has the ambitious Health Agenda for the Americas (ASA) 2008-2017 backing up its healthcare sector. The program was developed in 2007 by an international working group led by Panama's own MINSA, and was signed by all the health ministers in the Americas. Up until now, the agenda has served as a strategic and policy document that guides public policies and health interventions throughout the region. However, with new challenges on the horizon, Panama will soon be seeking to design new sustainable policies and strategies that better address its needs</p>
<p>At the national level, Panama has already devised and presented a Food and Nutrition Security Plan 2017-2021, which specifies what actions need to be taken to address malnutrition. Currently, obesity has proven to be an emerging issue, with 21% of adults considered obese. A further 57% of Panamanian adults are overweight. On the opposite side of the spectrum, undernourishment is still prevalent in up to 10% of the Panamanian population; however, that figure has declined steadily over the past 15 years and shows signs of improvement heading into 2017. Under the guidance of the larger food security plan, a school nutrition program has been implemented with an investment of over USD18 million, aimed at providing basic and healthy meals for students across Panama.</p>
<h4>HOSPITAL CITY</h4>
<p>A number of government-led initiatives, as well as private projects, are set to revolutionize the way Panamanians gain access to healthcare. With the current administration finally settled in, many projects that were on hold have been kickstarted and are back on track to meet targets for completion.</p>
<p>One such project is Hospital City, a USD517 million project of 17 buildings and 1,342 hospital beds. Work on Panama's Hospital City began in May 2012. The project, which was commissioned by Panama's social security organization, is designed to extend over an area covering 78 acres, and 54% of the first phase is already complete. After a lull in activity in 2015, the second phase of construction has begun. Once completed, the project will play a vital role in meeting the 5% annual increase in demand for specialized care for subscribers of social security healthcare plans. Meanwhile, 20% of the project's facilities will be available for use by MINSA. In September 2016, Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela announced that the National Oncology Institute will be relocated to Hospital City by the end of 2018&mdash;offering oncology services to a wider number of patients at a higher standard of quality. In addition, the new location will offer 100 more beds, increasing its capacity to 250 inpatients.</p>
<p>At the same time, SBA Group's Panama Medical Center (PMC) project is gearing up to build on more than 30,000sqm of medical real estate in the central medical district of Panama City. Hospital Nacional, Hospital del Ni&ntilde;o, and Hospital Santo Tomas, the leading healthcare facility in Panama, are all located within the same area. The USD15 million PMC project is slated for completion by mid-2018.</p>
<p>The Centro M&eacute;dico del Este project, which consists of three towers of seven stories for medical offices and specialized clinics, is also underway. The center will specialize in areas such as prevention and diagnostics, as well as treatment, with results-oriented approach to clinical cases and comprehensive medical collaboration. Meant to be as accessible as possible, the healthcare center also features a car parking facility of over 4,000 spaces.</p>
<h4>WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED</h4>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies, hospital operators, and healthcare sector ancillary services providers have long converged in Panama as a result of its geographical position and attractiveness as a medical tourism and retirement location. Those who come to Panama seeking treatment typically need medical attention for orthopedics, oncology, plastic surgery, and odontology services.</p>
<p>For GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Panama represents a hub from which it can supply the rest of Latin America with high-quality medicines and services. The company operates a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant that employs around 300 people and exports 90% of its products to over 24 countries in the region. &ldquo;The main product that we produce here is Panadol in several versions. Our operations are important, not only because it is a sign of how multinational companies believe in the country as a place for manufacturing but also because we employ people from Panama,"" Monica Shaw, Cluster Head of Panama, Honduras, South Caribbean for GSK, told TBY. With R&amp;D coming into view as a critical component of the future, GSK operates four business units in the country: the Latin American Hub for Vaccines Clinical Research, the Latin America Hub for Logistic and Demand, a consumer products manufacturing site, and a pharmaceuticals headquarters for Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>For Centro M&eacute;dico Paitilla, Panama is a place for training and educating a workforce with huge potential. &ldquo;We believe our people need to continuously update their knowledge to keep on their professional development. There is a lack of qualified human resources in the health sector in Panama. In this context, our investment in our people becomes even more relevant,"" Vilma Moreno de Arias, Executive Director of Centro M&eacute;dico Paitilla, explained to TBY. To that end, the medical center supports its doctors as it treats patients with new methodologies and technology. In addition, the company sees itself as a key proponent of not only educating its staff, but the Panamanian people at large. &ldquo;We put in a great deal of effort to promote and participate in talks, conventions, special events, and similar sectoral meetings that target the public,"" Moreno de Arias emphasized.</p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/4840ec70-eee0-41bc-83fd-6081d5a710e6.jpg","","","","Healthcare spending in both the public and private arenas had increased as the population grows and more expatriates choose Panama as a place to retire.","","Health","the-key-is-patients","1487","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF), the Development Bank of Latin America, along with Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture are other important promoters of all the initiatives related to CECOM-RO. The center is currently promoting “Vision Chiriquí¬ 2025,“ developing promotional, technical, and financial activities through the entire western region of Panama.</p><p>The Agro-Master Plan for the development of the western region will start in March 2017 and is envisioned to double the agricultural output of the regions of Chiriquí¬, Bocas del Toro, and Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé. CAF and Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina have recently agreed to finance the project, lending USD155 million over three phases: USD30 million will be allocated for 2017, USD45 million in 2018, and the remaining will be split in the following years. This year, more than 500 producers will be financed and the financing activity is targeted to reach 4,500 producers in the next four years. In order to develop the master plan for the development of the western region, the private sector will invest around USD350 million in a strategic alliance with the public sector. The funding is expected to provide producers with investment projects that will increase productivity and the efficiency of the value chains of the sector in products that are in high demand by consumers.</p><p>The western region of Panama has the potential to develop into a hub for the development of the agro-industrial sector, not only in Panama but also in Central America. In 2016 Nestlí¨ started investing in the region, seeding more than 100ha with tomatoes and the  multinational company plans to seed an additional 400ha by the end of 2017. Grupo G. Inversiones from Nicaragua plans to seed 10,000ha with maní¬, meeting both the local and regional demand for this product.</p><p>The master plan will be initially characterized by the activation of different programs focusing on sanitation, the installation of modern laboratories to boost R&amp;D to be applied both to existing and potentials crops, training the local workforce, irrigation and logistics projects, and the development of local public institutions. When successfully developed, the master plan will allow the western region to produce key products with significant export potential such as milk and dairy products, oil palm, vegetable, coffee, bananas, cocoa, tubers, and rice. The total production of these goods is targeted to reach USD500 million, or revenues of USD40 million annually, and the creation of more than 30,000 jobs.</p><p>Moreover, with the vision of turning the country into an agro hub, the Maritime Authority of Panama (AMP) has signed a USD100 million agreement with CAF to determine the feasibility of building an intermodal dry canal between Puerto Armuelles in Chiriquí¬ in the Pacific and a complementary port in Bocas del Toro in the Atlantic. When fully implemented, these initiatives promise to dramatically increase the quality of life in the western region and boost its economic competitiveness in the country. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CECOM-RO","go-west","1502","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Located in the west of Balboa, the Calzada de Amador was originally designed to serve as the canal's breakwater, stretching for 6km out into the bay, connecting the city with four islands next to the Pacific Ocean. Built in 1913 with rocks excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, the causeway connects the continent to the islands of Perico, Flamenco, and Naos. The causeway features views of the Pacific entrance to the canal and the line of vessels waiting their turn as well as the breathtaking skyline of Panama City. Amador has established itself as a well-known escape among Panama's wealthier residents, who come to jog, swim, stroll, rollerblade, or cycle while enjoying the sea air and the views. The northern section of Calzada has been turned into an entertainment area that is now the location of upscale bars, restaurants, hotels, and a marina.</p><p>2017 marks the inauguration of the new causeway. After three years of works, Varela's government launched the new Calzada de Amador on April 2017. The project, developed by Ininco SA, was built at a cost of over USD74 million. The new causeway is characterized by the construction of two new additional lanes for traffic that will connect the main roundabout with the Monument of the National Flag, and with the main entrance to Flamenco Island. New roundabouts and dedicated cycling and pedestrian lanes were also constructed, along with a leisure center, including three areas for sports, recreation, and public toilets, and the new causeway features 7.5km of green spaces, play areas, and parks. The entire promenade will be illuminated by LED streetlights.</p><p>The initial cost of the project—conceived during President Martinelli's administration—was USD66.4 million. The Varela government subsequently approved a new lighting system, costing USD729,222, a new design for the bicycle lane, and a new network of pipes, costing USD5 million. The maintenance activity executed over the last 36 months came to slightly over USD2 million. The new avenue stretches for 4km and features a drainage and sewer system as well as 3.2m wide lanes for 115 vehicles and buses.</p><p>This new project is vital for the development of Panama's maritime industry. There are also other projects in the works in the Amador area designed to further develop the local maritime sector, including a cruise terminal that can simultaneously accommodate two ships and the state-of-the-art Amador Convention Center. During an interview with TBY, Jorge Barakat Pitty, the Minister of Maritime Affairs, talked about the construction of a new port in Amador: “One of the top projects for President Varela this term is the development of a maritime port for cruises in the Pacific in the Amador area. The tender will be decided in March 2017, and we foresee the finalization of this project within 18 months.""

"2017-06-22T10:19:00.000Z","2017-06-21T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","A Watershed Moment","<p>When president Ricardo Martinelli was in power from 2009 to 2014, he implemented a USD15-billion plan to boost Panama's various sectors, including financial services, agriculture, logistics, tourism, and infrastructure. This scheme was in addition to the USD5.5 billion Panama Canal expansion project, the backbone to the country's growth strategy.</p>
<p>As a result of these efforts, Panama's Ministry of Economy and Finance expects a 2017 economic growth rate of 5.8%, the highest rate among all Latin American countries. While overall growth is being seen across the country, particularly in construction, mining, finance, and public services, Panama's agricultural sector continues to lose its footing.</p>
<p>Approximately 50% of Panama's land is used for agriculture, but the sector has been weakened by climate variability, extreme weather conditions, land degradation, and poor management of public resources. It is also threatened by competition brought on by increased imports.</p>
<h4>GEOGRAPHY, CLIMATE &amp; LAND</h4>
<p>Located in Central America between Costa Rica and Colombia, Panama borders the Caribbean Sea and north Pacific Ocean. Nearly 500 rivers run through Panama's landscape, which encompasses a terrain that mostly consists of steep, rugged mountains, and upland plains, with coastal areas largely dominated by plains and rolling hills. Panama has a tropical climate with little seasonal variation. The rainy season lasts from April to December, with much heaver rain on the Caribbean side of the continental divide.<br />Subsistence farming&mdash;mostly of corn, beans, and tubers&mdash;is commonly practiced from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands. Banana plantations occupy deltas near Costa Rica. Mangrove swamps span large parts of both coasts.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal Watershed is a hydrologically complex, ecologically diverse water resource system comprised of sub-basins, rivers, and dammed lakes stretching across an area of nearly 3,000sqkm on both sides of the Panama Canal. In the 19th century, forests were cleared for railroads and other infrastructure projects to support the Panama Canal, virtually degrading the Panama Canal Watershed. Between 1904 and 1914, deforestation continued as the canal was partially opened. When Panama regained control of the canal from the US in 1979, deforestation continued in stride.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the government introduced laws that prohibited deforestation. In 2011, the Panama Canal Authority jumpstarted a reforestation program to protect dry season water flows needed for the daily operation of the canal and to ensure drinking water for 1.3 million people, or two-thirds of the country's population. The watershed is now a source of fresh water and electricity generation.</p>
<h4>AGRICULTURE OUT OF FOCUS</h4>
<p>An industrial revolution in Panama has put agriculture on the backburner. Over the past few decades, the contribution of agriculture to Panama's GDP has declined substantially. In 1989, agriculture comprised more than 9% of GDP. As of 2015, this figure fell to barely 3%, despite accounting for 16% of total employment in the country.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2014, Panama has doubled its income per capita, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Such growth has spawned the demand for construction, a sector that expects a 14% increase in 2017, compared to the 7% increase documented in 2015. Labor-intensive and relying mostly on non-skilled workers, the construction sector and its current boom has surely helped to reduced poverty and inequality in the country. However, such growth has come at a cost</p>
<p>Javier A. Montemayor, business representative of Stockton Group, tells TBY, &ldquo;Panama is a country dedicated to services. The new generation does not study or focus on agriculture. The young people of Panama see their future working in services, logistics, industry, the canal, banks, and other service-related activities. The previous governments did not invest in agriculture and agriculture education, and the country lacks good laws and programs for its development.</p>
<p>Agricultural exports have mirrored this contraction, going from just above USD503 million in 2012 to USD277 million 2015. In 2016, exports decreased by 8%, largely due to low exports of tropical fruits, which has dropped by 45% since 2009. In 2016, melon exports fell by 18%, pineapple exports by 36%, and banana exports by 4%. According to the Central American Economic Integration Secretariat, Panama ranks last in Central America agricultural exports with USD144.8 million. A poor logistics sector, few incentives, and increased competition with imports have also fed into the sector's production decline. David Proenza, CEO of Urban Vertical Farms, told TBY of another important factor: climate change. &ldquo;In 2009 we saw the first signs of climate change in Panama. We lost 50% of our field production due to the weather that year. It happened again in 2010 [...] Exports dropped across the board.""</p>
<p>Without more support from Panama state agencies, it seems there is little motivation to increase production in the agricultural sector, particularly in light of logistical and climate-related challenges.</p>
<h4>RICE IN COMPETITION</h4>
<p>Rice farmers are experiencing the threat of increased importation first hand. Unable to compete with international prices, domestic rice producers are abandoning their crops, with some 20,000ha at stake.<br />In 2015, rice imports reached 1.4 million quintals, causing domestic prices to fall. Instead of selling paddies for USD24-25, rice growers sold them for USD21-22. In response to the hike in rice imports, the government pledged USD18 million in subsidies to rice growers, buying 500 million hundredweight and renting agro-industrial infrastructure to store crops in Panama East, Dari&eacute;n, and the central provinces.</p>
<h4>BANANAS AT RISK</h4>
<p>Banana has long played an important role in Panama's economy. In 1985, bananas were the leading export item in Panama, comprising 23%&mdash;USD 78 million&mdash;of total exports. By 2015, banana exports increased to USD 97.9 million and accounted for 4% of all the country's exports. In the first eight months of 2015, Panama was the fourth-largest exporter of bananas in Central America, following Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras, exporting a total of 135,625 metric tons.</p>
<p>In April 2017, Panama's parliament approved a 20-year contract between Banapi&ntilde;a de Panama and Del Monte Foods, a US-based food production and distribution company, which will invest more than USD100 million to revive banana production in Panama. The investment will develop approximately 5,804ha of land and will involve constructing buildings and facilities to complement the project's operations. The project will result in the production of 2,725 boxes of bananas per hectare per year.</p>
<p>However, banana manufacturers are bracing themselves for a potentially fatal storm: the Panama Disease. In the 1960s, the fungal plant disease that attacks the roots of banana plants wiped out the commercially-popular Gros Michel, or Big Mike, bananas in Central and South America, costing farmers USD2.3 billion worth of product. Today, a new strain of the Panama Disease is threatening to return to Latin America. Since the 1990s, the deadly fungus has affected up to 247,000 acres of bananas around the world, eradicating the Cavendish banana industry in Taiwan and causing strain on banana farmers in China, other parts of Asia, Australia, and Africa. And while a study in late 2015 confirmed that the new strain had not yet reached Latin American soil, manufacturers remain cautious. Del Monte and Dole Food Co. are working to develop a disease-resistant banana that could one day replace the Cavendish. Meanwhile, Del Monte is going out of its way to prevent the entry of contaminated material to its farms, container yards, and other facilities.</p>
<h4>COFFEE AT THE CENTRE</h4>
<p>Panama's climate is ideal for coffee production. High elevation, volcanic soil, and the proper balance of moisture and sun in a tropical highland climate all join forces to make Panama the coffee power that it is. In 2016 Panama produced 115,000 60kg-bags of coffee, a 6% increase from 2015. In 2016/17, Panama exported 18,000 60kg-bags, a 23% decrease from the 2015/16 period.</p>
<p>Although the country is ranked 35th among the top coffee producing countries in the world, it is not its output that makes it a coffee hotspot&mdash;it is its quality of output. Today, most of Panama's coffee is cultivated in the Highlands of Chiriqu&iacute;, in the towns of Boquete and Volc&aacute;n at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 6,000m. Panama is home to the infamous Geisha varietal, which has been dubbed the most expensive coffee bean in the world. Originally from Ethiopia and brought to Panama via Costa Rica in 1963, Geisha coffee beans are coveted for their light body, jasmine aroma, and citrusy taste. In 2013, Panama's Geisha coffee was bought for a record USD350 per pound by Japanese company Saza Coffee and Taiwanese company Haaya Gourmet Coffee. Other Panamanian varieties include the Typica, Caturra, Catuai, Bourbon, San Ramon, Pache, and Mundo Novo coffee beans, which are typically harvested from December to March.</p>
<h4>FISHING WITH A BAN</h4>
<p>Between 2008 and 2016, fish exports decreased substantially, from USD419 million to USD128 million, mostly due to the 2010 ban on industrial longline fishing. Because of this loss, the government and fishing sector officials are now contemplating lifting the ban, which was introduced by former president Ricardo Martinelli as a way to preserve marine life, particularly that of sharks, turtles, and billfish that were caught as a byproduct of the technique.</p>
<p>Some fishers are attesting to the ban's incompetency, revealing that the regulation has affected exports of migratory species tuna and dorado, which neighboring countries are now catching. Even so, Panama remains the second-largest exporter of fish in Central America, with 28,000 tons, but will lose its foothold if the fishing sector fails to revive itself. The current government is hoping to overturn the ban whilst finding a way to monitor longline fishing activities.</p>
<h4>CONTROLLED FARMING</h4>
<p>At the mercy of extreme elements and falling production levels, traditional farming may one day take a backseat to controlled environment agriculture in Panama. The country is host to the International Congress on Controlled Environment Agriculture 2017, and for good reason. Panama's agriculture sector is directly affected by climate change and is turning to unique technologies&mdash;vertical farming, greenhouse vegetable production, and indoor agriculture&mdash;to reverse the sector's downward spiral.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agricultural Development and the Foundation for Development in Controlled Environment Agriculture founded the Research Center or Controlled Environment Agriculture Production in Panama, which works with experts to improve agriculture technology and research.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","With 50% of Panama's land used for agriculture, it is little wonder the sector is essential to the country's economy. However, in recent years, Panama's farmers have witnessed reduced output and exports of agriculture products. Whether the country can turn its agricultural fate around depends on the state's management of resources and regulations.","","Agricultural turnaround?","a-watershed-moment","1660","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405d","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-22T08:40:00.000Z","2017-06-21T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Beyond the Horizon","","","","","","","","<p>According to the Panamanian government, construction is one of the greatest contributors to the country's GDP, representing some USD8.8 billion in 2016 and employing over 11% of the national labor force. Approximately 178,000 families in Panama generate their income from the construction sector, which accounts for 16% of GDP. By including general contracting work, subcontractor activity, equipment suppliers, construction materials, and real estate developers into that mix, the overall contribution to GDP exceeds 30%. The construction and real estate industry as a whole is currently valued at well over USD11 billion, with construction growing by 8% in the first trimester of 2017.</p>
<p>Despite the enormous amount of existing projects and activity in the market, real estate companies, buyers, and investors face complex bureaucratic processes in Panama. In order to gain approval for residential or commercial construction projects, industry players must not only comply with legal procedures in 19 institutions, but wait up to four years to receive the go-ahead from regulators. Related institutions include the Ministry of Public Works, the Institute of National Aqueducts and Sewers, the Transit Authority, the National Environment Authority, and the Ministry of Health, which all contribute to the development of housing and real estate infrastructure in Panama City and throughout the country. &ldquo;Within the Ministry of Housing lies the Vice Ministry of Territorial Ordering, where approvals for preliminary projects&mdash;be they state projects or private initiatives&mdash;are given. From that perspective, the Ministry of Housing plays a key role because this initial process depends a great deal on private developers, which in this case are one of the most important economic engines of the country in employment, investment, and economic activity,"" Mario Etchelecu, Minister of Housing, told TBY. For that reason, the Varela administration has placed great importance on the formation of a &ldquo;single-window"" process so that procedures are as efficient as possible.</p>
<p>The ministry's Solidarity Fund for Housing is being expanded from 74 promoters to over 525 in 2017, with the initial goal of building 25,000 housing solutions in five years increased to 100,000 units. &ldquo;It will not only give a boost to the economy but will encourage both public investment by the government and private investment to reduce the country's housing gap,"" Minister Etchelecu explained. The government's investment toward the sector will also grow from USD1.6 billion to more than USD2.1 billion by the end of the year. &ldquo;We expect to deliver 40,000 completed homes to the beneficiary families by the end of 2017,"" he concluded.<br />While public projects continue on a growth trajectory, the private sector is facing slowdowns that can affect any economy that has undergone rapid growth over a short period. Since the turn of the 21st century, Panama has posted nearly double-digit growth economically, especially within the real estate and construction sector. As the country moves into a new era following the expansion of the Panama Canal, private-sector operators are increasing efforts to bring innovation, sustainability, and diversity to upcoming projects. For investors, projects that push the envelope and take advantage of the country's natural beauty without compromising the environment are also becoming more attractive.</p>
<p>With the cost of construction still lower than in European, North American, and some Latin American markets, Panama offers favorable ROI to international construction players. Whereas construction in Europe hovers around USD1,500-2,000 per sqm in 2017, Panama boasts a cool USD800 per sqm. Meanwhile, the price of land weighs in at USD300-400 per sqm, although costs vary according to the number of units being built on a given plot</p>
<h4>WHERE TO LOOK</h4>
<p>Panama's real estate sector continues to push the limits as it grows. Developers are seeking ways not only to create fresh urban ideas, but also revive rural areas of the country that were formerly overlooked. &ldquo;Look for growth in Panama City's suburbs, and interior in general, as well as beach expansion on the Caribbean coast, and new residential developments in the Canal Zone area, specifically in Balboa and Panama Pacifico,"" Valeri Dessiatnitchenko, CEO &amp; President of Archimesa, told TBY. Favorable prices and a forecast for stability over time are enticing new developers.</p>
<p>Panama's real estate developers are looking ahead for trends that would promote sustainability. Jaime de Saint Malo, General Manager of EDIFYCA, has noted that increasing the population density through real estate development is a positive shift for the country. With more people gathering in developed areas, the environment benefits from less carbon emissions, as well as more foot traffic instead of vehicle use. &ldquo;Proper density allows more people to have a better quality of life that they deserve. If we can offer more people a better quality of life, we will have better economic results that will result in more sustainability for businesses and for the entire community,"" Saint Malo said.</p>
<p>The Panama Green Building Council (PGBC) is also working to prevent the &ldquo;urban sprawl,"" replacing it instead with more sustainable city design as well as more efficient housing. The PGBC's 135 members are also collaborating on a key project to establish baseline consumption statistics so that builders, consumers, and governmental officials can monitor the market's overall efficiency and consumption statistics. &ldquo;This will allow companies to more effectively design and market their products and will allow consumers to make informed product decisions,"" Roberto Forte Taylor, Director of PGBC, told TBY. Among the over 600 projects underway in Panama, approximately 85 are working to acquire LEED certification. There are already 30 LEED-certified projects in the country, making Panama second only to Costa Rica in Central America in terms of green building initiatives.</p>
<p>The trend toward promoting more population-dense areas is not totally contrived; in fact, of Panamanians living in urban areas, many are now seeking smaller and more affordable apartments. Prompted by transportation difficulties or long commutes from the city limits, Panama's city-dwellers are gravitating toward city centers, where a 50sqm apartment averages about USD150,000. Lucas Ricardo Zarak M&aacute;rquez, Marketing and Sales Manager of Grupo Equinox, emphasized in an interview with TBY that &ldquo;[city centers are] our focus right now, and most of the competition is also starting to attack this type of market.""<br />Two of the segments that have seen a marked decline in activity are beach resort projects and second homes. Although there is still investor interest in these areas, better infrastructure will be necessary before development can truly take off.</p>
<h4><br />NEXT BIG THING</h4>
<p>New design technology and a keen sense of the Panamanian aesthetic are key launching points for the development of high-tech and futuristic innovations in the local real estate and construction sector. <br />Architectural software firm Archimesa has developed a state-of-the-art 3D rendering technique that allows the designers to completely model and map out real estate space virtually. &ldquo;Our modeling is a much more interactive experience than rendering. All the new technologies that come out, such as virtual and augmented reality, are natural feeds for us because we need real-time computer generated graphics for those devices,"" Dessiatnitchenko told TBY. The company's long-term goal is to create a product that allows architects to input a design and be able to instantly see a visualization. Such an application would also be interactive, allowing architects, real estate agents, and construction companies to demonstrate their creations to clients and investors. &ldquo;We want to license the software to other marketing companies that do static renders. The tools they use to produce those static renders are similar to the tools we have to use to make our real-time apps. The learning curve will thus not be that big for those companies if we give them our software, and then they will be able to similar products to their clients,"" Dessiatnitchenko concluded.</p>
<p>For projects underway that are well past the design stage, developers are seeking ways to present their creations to an audience that extends past the inhabitants themselves, creating a sense of culture and community. &ldquo;Our project in Las Tablas is a cultural platform to strengthen the region's identity, culture, and folklore, inciting local and international tourism to visit Las Tablas and exposing its value first-hand,"" EDIFYCA's Saint Malo emphasized. The artistic and heritage-infused project offers a platform from which EDIFYCA can contribute to the growth of the country by tapping into its authentic aspects.</p>
<p>The revitalization of Calle Uruguay in Panama City is the first urban renovation design competition spearheaded by the public sector since the 1930s. With a key focus on design instead of profitability, the project is set to take off in a myriad of exciting directions. Under the guidance of a feasible budget, architectural firm Forza Creativa is looking forward to the widening of sidewalks, addition of park benches, and ample lighting to create an impetus for commerce and establish the area as a safe neighborhood. &ldquo;It attracts new residents who want to live in a mixed-use neighborhood and can afford to live in the urban core, right next to a metro station, and can walk to work and live within a five-mile radius with a lifestyle that is urban, young, and metropolitan,"" Annamaria Zampogna, Principal at Forza Creativa, told TBY. Within close proximity to public transportation, Zampogna's partner, Eduardo Quintero, agrees that the project will create spaces for social interaction that will humanize the society. &ldquo;This will be a catalyst for the private sector, the public sector, and for people to change their behavior and lifestyle,"" he said.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive upcoming real estate project is Green Valley, valued at USD30 billion. The project's aim is to protect and preserve the natural beauty of the country by developing and building residential space that blends into the local surroundings. Located north of Panama City, the project is being developed on the coastline, guaranteeing residents a setting surrounded by breathtaking views and greenery. &ldquo;We have sold slightly more than USD100 million in land, which translates into 300 land plots for houses. However, the main sales activity has focused on selling housing units within taller buildings, which is much more environmentally friendly,"" Carlos Malo de Molina, General Manager of Green Valley, told TBY.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/e30df7bf-5ee1-49e9-9d07-629e1cbc6feb.jpg","","","","Panama's developers and contractors continue to lead the economy, contributing to nearly one-third of the nation's GDP.

"2017-06-22T08:24:00.000Z","2017-06-22T08:24:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Sea Sure","<p>Since the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, Panama has been one of the world's most important locations for maritime trade. The canal's status as the connector between the East and the West placed Panama at the forefront of the industry for the 20th century, making it a central location for the growth of the global shipping industry and the new logistical connections that formed as a globalized world looked to bring new products to new markets. It is no surprise, then, that Panama's port infrastructure ranks among the best in the world. Decades of experience have made the sector one of the cornerstones of the Panamanian economy, and the government is working hard to ensure that it will continue to remain so for years to come. The expansion of the Panama Canal was the flagship project, but billions of dollars of investment in the surrounding container ports speak to the nationwide commitment to infrastructure development that will keep Panama's maritime industry a global leader.</p><p>While the canal may get all the attention, Panama's status as a hub for the global shipping industry has resulted in the development of a robust port network equipped to handle both container and general cargo. Through a combination of private, state, and concessionaire ports on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, Panama firms service the many shipping companies that come through the country. While there are dozens of active ports, a handful of major ones located close to the canal handle the bulk of container traffic. Manzanillo International Terminal (MIT), located at a former US naval base, is the largest port on the Atlantic Coast. One of the most technologically advanced ports in the region, it handles containers, general cargo, and Ro-Ro cargo at a facility that has a logistical park and access to ground, railroad, and air transportation services. In 2015 it moved 1.97 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs), down 4.8% from 2014 but still the second-largest volume in the nation's ports.</p><p>Privately operated through a concession granted through the Panamanian government, MIT has become a cornerstone of the largest transshipment port in Latin America thanks to its well-maintained infrastructure. With storage capacity of over 66,000 TEUs, its size and ability to transport goods easily to and from the Colón Free Zone and rail have made it a leader in Latin American shipping. Through its actions, MIT has become a leader in Panama's maritime industry both as an example of the logistical expertise needed to grow and as an example of the social role ports can play in the nation. Moving forward, its challenge will be to adapt to the conditions created by the expansion of the canal through smart investment and optimization of its labor supply. Juan Carlos Croston, MIT's Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, believes that technology is key to lowering costs: “The trick is to create capacity in a way that can match demand without spending a large amount of money."" “What we have done in many cases in our terminal is to use the same footprint that we have and add more technology…We seek to do a little bit through more advanced technology equipment to lower costs.""</p><p>On the Pacific side of the canal, Balboa is one of the single-largest ports in Latin America, handling 3.1 million TEUs in 2015. Privately operated, its status as the only fully operating container terminal on the western side gives it significant importance in the Panamanian shipping industry, and its modern and flexible construction allows it to handle all types of cargo. Like MIT, Balboa's operators have taken care to invest heavily in upgrading infrastructure, allowing it to meet the needs of the modern shipping industry. Paul Wallace, Executive President of port operator Panama Ports Company (PPC), notes that Balboa installed the capacity needed to accommodate Post-Panamax ships well before the expansion of the canal. “While ports in the US are all scrambling at the moment to be able to handle large vessels, PPC is already there,"" Wallace told TBY. “We were perceptive and prudent enough to invest early and have the capability to take the world's biggest vessels, even though these cannot go through the canal. We can already take 18,000-20,000 TEU vessels at PPC. We have the water depth, the outreach on our cranes, and the infrastructure and yard capacity to handle the vessels of tomorrow.""</p><p>Though well established by now, new arrivals on the maritime logistics scene have kept competition high and encouraged new infrastructure investment. Singapore-based PSA International, the world's largest port operator, opened a port terminal on the Pacific side of the canal in 2010. PSA Panama began container operations in 2012, and has since grown to handle more than 157,000 TEUs in 2015. Though well below the volume of Balboa, PSA's organizational size and logistical experience have already made it an attractive destination for East Asian firms looking for another shipping hub on Panama's western coast.</p><p>Panama's government is also using its maritime experience and international connections to construct a new port on the Pacific primarily for cruises. With the expansion of the canal, government officials expect more than 230 cruise ships to transit the new wider locks. Long a key source of tourism, cruise passenger numbers dropped from 182,000 in the first nine months of 2014 to 45,000 in the same time frame in 2015 and 32,000 in 2016 due in part to fewer routes to Panama. Government officials are confident that improved infrastructure for cruise ships and the expanded canal will return some of this lost tourism. To ensure that the new port is a success, Panamanian officials have been in contact with the Port of Hamburg, Germany's largest port and a major European cruise ship hub. “We signed a cooperation agreement with [the Port of Hamburg] to emulate its operations and facilitate the technical capabilities and regulations for the successful operation of this new maritime port in Amador,"" Minister of Maritime Affairs Jorge Barakat Pitty told TBY. Connections such as these instill confidence in cruise industry operators and should help maintain the strength of this key tourism industry.</p><p>Moving forward, the maritime sector is not without its challenges in the short run—shifting demand patterns and a lack of support infrastructure have kept volume numbers from rising as quickly as expected after the expansion of the canal. Yet through it all port infrastructure remains a fundamental strength, as evidenced by the World Economic Forum ranking Panama's ports seventh in the world in its 2015 global competitiveness index. “Panama has proven its technical capability and strength as an international service platform,"" Pitty told TBY, and these same strengths should keep the maritime industry a pillar of the Panamanian economy for years to come. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Panama's port infrastructure has long been a strength, and new investment aimed at increasing efficiency through technological innovation should reap long-term rewards.","","Maritime","sea-sure","1269","552ef2b0361618126878404e","57613a2786b7b019b0235425","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In June 2015, the Panamanian authorities awarded the Panama City Metro Line 2 project to a Brazilian-Spanish consortium formed by the companies Odebrecht and Fomento, Contratas y Construcciones (FCC), which had also constructed the 16km-long Line 1 of the Metro at an approximate cost of USD2.1 billion.</p><p>When receiving the TBY Award for “the most impactful infrastructure project in the country,"" Roberto Roy, Minister of Canal Affairs and Metro of Panama, commented: “If we look at national polls, the Metro is the number-one entity in public satisfaction. We are always above 80%, which gives us a great deal of satisfaction. We are proud to have done something that has truly changed people's lives for the better in Panama (…) The long-term view for the Metro is in fact a total of seven or eight lines. However, we are talking about a pretty robust network and have done the planning for this through to 2040. The first line was a USD2 billion investment, and that included an 8km tunnel. Line 2 will be longer than the first, at 21km, and will have 16 stations and 21 more trains. We have been increasing ridership for the entire metro and are now at double the expected number of daily passengers. For Line 1, we originally calculated around 140,000 daily passengers; however, we have had days with nearly 300,000 passengers, with the average hovering around 275,000. This has made us place an order for additional cars, and we are buying 70 new cars for Line 1. This way, we can cope with the estimated demand.""</p><p>The Panama Metro, with only one line in operation, currently employs 300 people, 98% of whom are Panamanians. The Operations Center has 20 screens that allow staff to monitor incidents in all 13 stations of Line 1. The center controls the operation of all trains, the power supply for trains and stations, electrodynamics equipment, air conditioning, escalators, and over 300 CCTV cameras to ensure the safety of commuters.<br>Line 2 of the metro project was sealed at a cost of USD1.8 billion and construction began in mid-2015. After several controversies and delays, works at the end of November 2016 registered progress of 26%, according to Metro of Panama. However, with fears that two lines will still be insufficient to accommodate growing demand, the government of Panama requested that the government of Japan provide technical cooperation for Line 3, as well as for the management of the interface between the Line 3 project and the fourth bridge over the Panama Canal. The cooperation is based on a USD2.6 billion loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The financial terms of the loan granted by JICA are based on 20 years, which includes a 14-year amortization, six-year grace period, and three years for disbursement.</p><p>Line 3 of the Metro will depart from Albrook Station and will travel through Arraiján and Nuevo Chorrillo, arriving in Ciudad del Futuro, west of the capital. It will travel along a 26.7km route, along which 14 stations will be constructed. This project will employ Japan's monorail system to carry commuters from the suburbs of Panama City to the city center in 45 minutes, which can take up to three hours by car because of traffic jams. Six-car trains will be able to accommodate up to 20,000 passengers, one way, at peak period in Phase 1 by 2020. Phase 2 envisions accommodating a maximum of 31,862 users daily by 2050. The Line 3 project will begin in 2017 and operations are estimated to commence at the end of 2021.

"2017-06-21T11:16:00.000Z","2017-06-20T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Even Flow","","","","","","","","<p>The Panama Canal will always be the crown jewel of Panama's transport industry, but the world should take care not to overlook the strides other areas of the sector have made in recent years. The arrival of Latin America's first subway system, the expansion of the Pan-American Highway, and the planned expansion of the Tocumen International Airport should all have tremendous impacts on the country's development and continued growth as a Central American business and tourism hub. The above projects represent more than USD2.5 billion in government investment over the next decade, a sign of the government's commitment to infrastructure improvements. And the canal is far from forgotten; a USD5.25 expansion project completed in 2016 more than doubled the maximum vessel size allowed, ensuring that the canal would remain one of the cornerstones of the modern shipping industry.</p>
<h4>CANAL EXPANSION</h4>
<p>Originally scheduled to be completed in 2014, the expansion of the Panama Canal was one of the country's largest engineering projects since the canal's original construction. Long one of the centerpieces of the global shipping industry, traffic through the canal has slowed in recent years due to its size limitations; the Panamax ships that were canal's previous maximum capacity had a capacity of around 5,000 TEUs, but the world's largest ships can now hold almost 200,000 TEUs. The USD9.4 billion-expansion consisted of several related projects, but most significant was the construction of a third set of locks to create an additional lane of traffic in the canal. In conjunction with this, the government also built a new 6.1km-long access channel for the new locks and dredged several channels to increase water supply and allowable volume. Labor issues involving the project's 40,000 workers led to delays of over two years, but the canal's inauguration in 2016 was a high point for the nation.</p>
<p>The canal upgrade will now allow ships of up to 13,000 TEUs to pass through the canal, more than enough to accommodate the majority of the world's global shipping fleet. The increased volume is particularly important for regaining traffic from East Asia to the eastern coasts of North and South America; larger ships are more cost-efficient on these routes, and the canal's ability to accommodate these ships should allow these popular routes to return to the canal. Early returns have been mixed, however; volumes have increased but not to the degree some expected. Many industry leaders are not fazed, noting that the supporting infrastructure needed to handle increased volumes is still being installed. &ldquo;We have to band together to provide more services to vessels, cargo, and crews,"" C&aacute;mara Mar&iacute;tima de Panam&aacute; (Maritime Chamber of Panama) President Rommel Troetsch told TBY. &ldquo;Vessels require repairs and spare parts &hellip;The infrastructure for trans-shipment ports and the infrastructure necessary to go to the anchorage to provide a vessel's needs must be boosted."" While improvements continue to be made, Panama's port infrastructure remains one of the country's strengths. Its years of experience in the international shipping industry has participants optimistic about the sector's growth in 2018 and beyond.</p>
<h4>SUBWAY</h4>
<p>The arrival of the Panama Metro in 2014 was a watershed moment for the development of the capital. The 13.7km-long, USD2 billion Line 1, Central America's first metro system, was widely hailed as a key accomplishment in alleviating vehicle traffic and offering a new affordable public transit option. Construction of Line 1 took place from 2011 to 2014 and included 7.3km of tunnels and 1.5km of trenches. Construction was completed by a consortium of Brazilian and Spanish contractors, with a contract for the cars awarded to French firm Alstom. With the first line up and operational, the government is working to optimize current performance and ensure that future rail development benefits as many citizens as possible. The response to Line 1 was more enthusiastic than even some optimistic projections had predicted, Minister of Canal Affairs and Metro Roberto Roy told TBY, and the government is taking that demand into account in its future planning. &ldquo;For Line 1, we originally calculated around 140,000 daily passengers, but we have had days with nearly 300,000 and the average is hovering around 275,000,"" Roy told TBY. &ldquo;This has made us place an order for additional cars&hellip; this purchase will be for both Line 1 and to cover extra demand for feeding passengers from Line 2.""</p>
<p>The long-term plan for the rail system is for a seven-eight-line network with around 90 stations to be constructed by 2040. Line 2, which will be a 21km above-ground line connecting the city with Tocumen International Airport, is expected to be finished by 2019 despite delays that have come about due to the Odebrecht Lava Jato scandal. The connection to the airport is of particular importance due to the planned expansion of Tocumen Airport; a new terminal is expected to increase annual capacity by more than 5 million passengers per year by 2022, and strengthening the city's public transit options will be necessary to fully reap the benefits of said expansion. Meanwhile, Lines 3 and 4 are currently in the planning stage; a USD2.6 billion loan agreement for the funding of Line 3 was signed between Panama and Japan in 2016, and construction on that line is expected to begin in late 2017 and conclude in 2021. With these long-term goals in place, the Panamanian government's current challenge is the fiscal health of the system. Several analysts believe that the current fare of USD0.35 per trip is too low, pointing to state data that showed a USD1.7 million gap between expenses and income collected via fares&mdash;a deficit that is only expected to increase as time goes on due to the arrival of new wagons and lines in the coming years. Still, the popularity and demand for the system means that its fiscal issues should be easy to overcome. &ldquo;If you look at national polls, the metro is the number-one entity in public satisfaction,"" Roy told TBY. &ldquo;We are always above 80%, which gives us a lot of happiness. We are proud to have done something that has really changed people's lives for the better in Panama.""</p>
<h4>TOCUMEN AIRPORT EXPANSION</h4>
<p>Panama's Tocumen Airport plays a key role as a connector for North and South America, and is currently undergoing a series of modernization projects to expand capacity and secure the airport's position as a hub for Central American travel. Tocumen Airport saw 14.7 million passengers pass through in 2016, a 9.7% increase over 2015 and almost three times that of the next-busiest Central American airport. More than 70% of Pamana's international tourists pass through Tocumen thanks to flights to 35 countries. The steady, continued growth of Panama's tourism, finance, and international investment sectors can be seen in the increase of volume through Tocumen; as recently as 2011, annual traffic was fewer than 9 million passengers. A series of infrastructure projects from 2015-2016 added a terminal and raised capacity to 15 million passengers per year. Recognizing that further improvements were needed, 2016 saw the beginning of an ambitious expansion plan that is expected to double passenger capacity upon completion in 2022. The expansion program, which is projected to cost USD800 million, will include the expansion of the airport's northern runway, and, in the longer term, the construction of a new passenger terminal, a new runway, and corresponding access roads to handle the increase in flows. Though the pace of development is rapid, careful stewardship by airport officials has kept the sector flowing smoothly. Felipe Bonifatti, Lufthansa's General Manager for Central America and Caribbean, summarized the aviation industry's confidence in Panama in an interview: &ldquo;The central location of Panama City, especially in terms of reaching destinations all across the Americas, is key,"" Bonifatti told TBY. &ldquo;We are also pleased with the airport infrastructure here at Tocumen International Airport&hellip; the smooth flow of traffic and travelers through the airport makes everything much easier for us.""</p>
<h4>HIGHWAYS</h4>
<p>Panama is also investing heavily in road infrastructure projects to generate new avenues of commerce, link previously underdeveloped areas of the country, and increase overall efficiency. The nation's roads are a mix of overused and underdeveloped; the lack of public transportation options in developed areas has placed considerable stress on the country's urban roads, yet over half the nation's 15,000km of roads were unpaved in 2010, according to the CIA World Factbook. The 2016 World Economic Forum ranked Panama's port and air transport infrastructure fifth and sixth in the world, respectively, but assessed its road quality as 48th-best. Well aware that its roads are the weak link in one of Central America's best transport infrastructures, the Panamanian government has launched a number of major projects in recent years. The government's 2015-2019 Strategic Plan has road infrastructure as one of its major areas for investment, with almost USD3 billion allocated for road and civil works over the five-year lifespan of the strategic plan. Some of the largest projects include an expansion of the Pan-American Highway, the construction of a fourth bridge over the Panama Canal, and an extension of the North Corridor Highway. All told, more than 200,000km of road construction are underway over the next five years. The interconnected nature of a country's infrastructure means that it is only as robust as its weakest point, and Panama's government has taken actions to increase flows in areas of greatest need. In recently awarding a tender for a USD335 million Pan-American highway project that will expand a 10km stretch of road by the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal, the message was clear; Panama's transport industry plays an essential role in the country's economic development and the state is willing to make the investments needed to keep it moving smoothly.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/f441b879-0cee-4ae3-a782-27bcbd2ab182.jpg","","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/2e3b9c13-c901-46b9-a2cb-c9f92844468e.jpg","","A recent expansion to the Panama Canal should allow it to remain a central part of the global shipping industry, and Panama's government is investing heavily in the supporting infrastructure needed to keep logistical chains flowing smoothly.","","Transport","even-flow-panama-2017","1695","552ef2b0361618126878404e","57613a2786b7b019b0235425","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-21T11:08:00.000Z","2017-06-20T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Connecting  the Future","","","","","","","","<p>With one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, Panama continues to make great strides in all sectors of its economy, including IT and telecoms. With the World Bank forecasting GDP growth of nearly 5.5% for 2017 and 2018, Panama is poised to continue expanding at an impressive rate.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to strong showing in the key pillars of technological readiness and innovation, Panama has risen eight places on the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index between 2015 and 2016 and 2016 and 2017, jumping from 50th to 42nd. The country is currently ranked 53rd in the pillar of technological readiness and 49th in innovation. Panama boasts 174 mobile cellular telephone subscriptions and 15.6 fixed telephone lines per 100 people, ranking the country at eighth and 67th in each respective category. The high cost of fixed-line telephone subscriptions has contributed to the widespread proliferation of mobile phone plans and usage across Panama. According to the World Bank, the contract mobile telephone market is dominated by Movistar, which has a market share of 52.7%, followed by Mas Movil at 24.9%, Digicel at 12.5%, and Claro at 9.9%. The prepaid mobile market is dominated Mas Movil with 42.3% market share, followed by Movistar at 35.7%, Digicel 13.4%, and Claro at 8.6%. Mobile telephone tariffs are quite low compared to the region. Though coverage is always expanding, some of the country's more remote regions lack coverage.<br />The country performed well in the categories of availability of latest technologies, firm-level technology absorption, and FDI and technology transfer, ranking 31, 27, and fifth, respectively. According to the WEF, 51.2% of the population are internet users, and there are 7.9 fixed broadband internet subscriptions per 100 people. Additionally, internet bandwidth is 75.9kb/s/user, which compares favorably to countries in the region, and there are 32.7 mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 people.</p>
<p>According to the UN's specialized institution for ICTs, ITU, females are the predominant users of the internet in Panama, with 52.5% of women using the web compared to 49.9% of men. In urban and rural areas this divergence persists, with 61.8% of urban females using the internet compared to 60.7% or urban males, while in rural areas 30.4% of females use the internet compared to 27.3% of males. Additionally, the proportion of all Panamanian households with radios is 71.7, while TVs is 87.5% and computers 39.6%, according to ITU.<br />According to the most recently available statistics from the World Bank, the ICT sector is growing faster than the economy as a whole, contributing more than USD2.4 billion to the Panamanian economy. While Panama is a strong exporter and importer of ICT goods, ICT imports represent more than 8% of total imports and ICT exports represent nearly 8% of total exports. Panama has also been working to improve its position in terms of ICT service exports. According to the World Bank, ICT services exports accounted for only a bit more than 6% of total service exports.</p>
<p>Panama's access to the internet is provided via a handful of undersea cables that make landfall at either side of the Panama Canal. By locating the cables' access points close to the canal, providers are able to insulate the system from natural disaster and attack. The newest broadband cable system is the Pacific Caribbean Cable System, a 6,000km system that connects the Caribbean and greatly enhances Panama's broadband infrastructure. According to the latest data from the World Bank, Panama has a maximum capacity of 33,425Gbps, which is above its lit capacity of 4,455Gbps. In 2016, telecoms giant Level 3 Communications expanded its systems in Latin America, including Panama.</p>
<p>ICT has formed the backbone of new initiatives aimed at improving the persistent social issues in the country. Firms are recognizing that new technologies are capable of transforming the way institutions and communities interact with one another and the government. One such company is Maxia LatAm, a firm dedicated to solving pressing social issues. In an interview with TBY, Peter A. Diaz A., explained the company's mission. &ldquo;The premise was to help solve social issues as people have basic needs in every country,"" said Diaz A. By emphasizing projects that can improve social needs, Maxia LatAm hopes to transform the country and the region. &ldquo;Panama is important to us; we have a vision for greatness and this country has a great deal to offer."" As more and more Panamanians become connected and enter the digital economy and society, the potential for solving some of the country's most persistent problems has grown by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>The potential for Panama is also immense, and IT firms recognize the role that the country could play. In interview with TBY, Tommy Habibe Vargas, General Manager of Benchmark Technologies, discussed the changes he foresees coming to the Panamanian and Latin American IT environment. &ldquo;Traditionally, Latin America has lagged a bit behind the US in IT, but the region is not that far behind. In certain areas of IT, we may even be ahead of North America. Latin America has some of the fastest-growing economies, and Panama has traditionally positioned itself as a hub for Latin America,"" said Vargas. &ldquo;All these factors make Panama a natural place for the IT sector, which is driven mostly by the American market.""</p>
<h4>Directing Growth</h4>
<p>The government has also been playing a major role in stimulating innovation and development in the country. As officials and institutions across Panama have been trying to stimulate growth and development in the ICT sector, one of the core strategies has been expanding access. Speaking with TBY, Dr. Jorge A. Motta, National Secretary of Science Technology and Innovation (SENACYT) for Panama, discussed the key role the government and SENACYT is playing in developing the country's ICT industry. Motta noted that his office strives to strengthen &ldquo;the National Sytem of Innovation by promoting programs to financially support entrepreneurs and companies that develop business innovation to create or improve a process, service, or product."" SENACYT has been so successful in this that Panama will soon be one of the leaders in Latin America in terms of registered patents.</p>
<p>SENACYT is also working to ensure that areas outside of the capital city have adequate ICT infrastructure through the development of Infoplazas. These Infoplazas are community learning centers that provide both access to the internet and digital training services for all walks of Panamanian life. The Infoplazas attempt to democratize digital services across Panama, and the more than 200 locations spread throughout the country serve to &ldquo;help close the digital breach in Panama,"" according to Motta. According to the World Bank, a 10% expansion of broadband penetration leads to an almost 1.4% increase in GDP per capita and every job directly created by broadband development leads to between 1.5 and 4.5 indirect jobs. Additionally, every dollar invested in directed low-cost or free internet stimulates activity worth more than USD7, according to the World Bank. SENACYT is trying to leverage its position to develop these types of technology-driven jobs by expanding access. As the country moves closer and closer to its goals of expanding prosperity for all of its citizens, IT and telecoms projects like the Infoplazas will continue to play a major role. By expanding access and knowledge, Panama is taking important steps towards bringing all of its citizens and residents into the 21st century.<br />SENACYT has not been the only institution attempting to redefine Panamanian's relationship to technology through internet access, however. Liberty Technologies, a growing telecom firm, has committed itself to expanding Wi-Fi access to customers across the country because it recognizes the potential internet has to make major changes within society. Talking to TBY, Moises N. Abadi, General Manager of Liberty Technologies, discussed the central importance of connecting people to the internet and the efforts his firm has been making to aid the government in transforming the nation's connectivity through the Internet Para Todos movement. &ldquo;We have over 3 million registered users and hundred of thousands of users connecting to the network every month,"" said Abadi. &ldquo;We have seen the results over the years; students, people with special needs, and people with no access to connectivity were able to participate in the rapidly advancing world as a result of Internet Para Todos."" Liberty Technologies and firms like it have taken the government's call to expand access seriously, and they have made great strides in expanding connectivity in the country.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/20071f56-144d-40fc-b650-8bc8dbc1805f.jpg","","","","As Panama's economy continues to expand at an impressive rate, IT and telecoms are a major driver of growth, sparking innovation and activity across the country.","","","connecting-the-future","2943","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405a","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-21T10:37:00.000Z","2017-06-20T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Strategic Realignment","","","","","","","","<p>Along with the strategic vision of becoming a global trade hub, over the last decade Panama has invested heavily in infrastructure, including the massive Panama Canal expansion project, and favored a free-trade economy prioritizing the finance and logistics sectors, and allowing an uncontrolled inflow of imported goods.</p>
<p>The current dynamics of the economy are rooted in Panama's history, as Michael A. Morales, President of Sindicato de Industriales de Panam&aacute; (SIP), told TBY in an interview: &ldquo;As far as moving cargo, Panama is a logistics center and that has been the case not just in the last 30 years but for 500 years. We have the canal, we have about 6 million containers that go by, but we just watch them go by; the potential is so great but we are not capable of seeing it. Most of the raw materials that cross from one part of the world to the other in fact go through Panama, and we have spent the better part of 100 years watching containers go by. If we are to be a logistics point in the Americas or the world, we should think about adding value to some of that because moving things in the long term is not a sound business model. We will need to add value to the goods that are moved through our canal and that is where we need industry to play an important role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, Panama's meager manufacturing sector, based on processed and packaged foods, beer and spirits, tobacco products, construction materials, and clothing and leather goods, is shrinking further.</p>
<h4>2016 data</h4>
<p>According to data released by representatives of the industry sector, in 2016 the share of industrial production in total GDP declined by almost 3%, on the back of a 12% fall in sugar production and an 11% decline in beverage production. In the construction materials sector, cement production declined by 5.1%, ready-mix concrete by 13%, and chemicals by 11%. As a result, the contribution of the industrial sector to total GDP declined by USD80 million, which corresponded to a 2.8% fall in value. Sector representatives expect a similar outlook for 2017.</p>
<p>The decline in the construction materials sector can be attributed to the completion of major infrastructure projects, as explained by Jorge Azcarraga, General Manager of Cemento Interoceanico: &ldquo;The canal expansion consumed most of that production and in fact there was a cement shortage. From 2H2014 and into 2015 some clinker had to be imported to meet the demand. In 2013 Cemento Interoceanico was in expansion mode because at that time the cement industry was around 2.3 million tons per year in Panama.&rdquo; Azcarraga goes on to specify that the continuity of infrastructure projects is dependent on continuous government policies, and is optimistic that the bottom will be hit within 2017 followed by a pick-up.</p>
<p>But overall investment data reflects strong investor sentiment, as foreign investment into Panama increased by 17.8% 2016, exceeding USD4 billion and placing the country as the major recipient of foreign investment in Central America. This suggests that with the right policies, these funds can be directed to the manufacturing and industrial production sectors.</p>
<h4>Some promising Sectors</h4>
<p>In 2016, mining was one of the few basic industries to have shown encouraging growth rates, as expressed by 3M General Manager Alejandro Martinez: &ldquo;The main sector 3M has been growing in is mining, where Minera Panam&aacute; is doing impressive work with its project. It will be the largest copper mine in Latin America and we have many solutions for its construction phase, which will probably continue for another two years.&rdquo;<br />Martinez also revealed the growth potential of the energy sector, as a growing population, mainly boosted by the inflow of immigrants, is boosting the demand for electrical products and new energy resources.<br />Proinvex, the agency responsible for promoting investment into the country's strategic sectors, also expects the energy sector to show strong results as the National Energy Plan for 2050 introduced the new strategy that will transform the energy matrix to one that is 70% based on renewable and alternative sources. Accordingly, sustainable energy projects, with an emphasis on wind and solar energy, will not only generate new investments and jobs, but will also indirectly contribute to new investments by strengthening the attractiveness of the business environment. Proinvex points to future LNG plant investments, which will supply domestic demand as well as create a hub for distribution thereof.</p>
<h4>Exports</h4>
<p>According to data revealed by Panama's Exporters' Association Apex, Panama's exports declined from USD1.8 billion in 2008 to USD636 million in 2016, losing almost half its value in eight years. The association is now engaging in policies that will boost the performance of traditional agricultural sector products such as watermelon, cucumbers, pineapples, and other traditional products that can be easily exported to the region and the international market. According to Juan Bulnes, President of Apex, even a landmark product such as pineapple could not perform well in 2016, while the international pineapple market was growing substantially, suggesting a lack of domestic policy in this area. This strategy is to be followed by a growth in agro-food industry, a strategic sector that is expected to benefit from newly introduced industry sector incentives.</p>
<h4>Expected Impact of free trade Zones</h4>
<p>In 2016, Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone (CFTZ), Panama's main export and re-export hub responsible for most of the cargo movement through the country, was reorganized with Law 8 of 2016. The previous governing law had been in place since the inception of the free zone 68 years ago. The new law expands the types of activities that qualify for the CFTZ and allows companies operating under a &ldquo;multinational company headquarters regime&rdquo; to do business there. It also brings new tax benefits, and simplifies immigration and work-related procedures to make processes more efficient. The new law is expected to attract yet more domestic and international business and impact growth of the industry sector, as the CFTZ's state-of-the-art international warehousing and infrastructure reinforces industries connected to the free zone. Official data for the first two months of 2017 already show a 23.3% recovery in the value of cargo movements in the CFTZ in USD terms.<br />Alberto A. Alem&aacute;n, Director of Proinvex, also revealed strategies regarding the Panama Pacifico Special Economic Area. &ldquo;We hope to see further investments in advanced manufacturing and third-party logistics operations, as well as value-added multi-modal logistics activities. Investments in headquarters, shared service activities, and high added-value services are a growth area in Panama Pacifico that are bringing the most sophisticated business processes to our country, and a multicultural community that fosters creativity, growth, and value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The creation and operation of the new Panapark Free Zone by the COINLA consortium on the eastern periphery of the capital is also expected to boost international business and the production of construction material. A land development project of 520,000sqm, it is set to become the largest private free trade zone in Panama.</p>
<h4>THe expansion of the Canal</h4>
<p>The expansion of the Panama Canal was operational as of July 2016 and will obviously impact the economy through an increased volume of services. However, according to Juan Bulnes, President of Apex, the expansion of the canal will also affect the industrial sector. He told TBY, &ldquo;It is fundamental for all players, including small industries, to capitalize on the expansion of the canal. Small companies are interested in developing business relationships with other countries and have seized the opportunities created by the expansion of the canal. Many of the vessels crossing the canal navigate to Europe, and this is a potential export route. It is a market that has an increasing demand for fishing products. That platform is already here and Panama is ready; our producers just have to increase output.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Productivity is Key</h4>
<p>With a dollarized economy and strong currency value compared to regional economies, Panama is at a slight disadvantage in terms of price competition. Coupled with a more expensive workforce, this disadvantage can only be addressed through improved productivity. Bulnes stated that, &ldquo;The secret is to boost the productivity of the products we are strong in and then enter the international market. We need our entrepreneurs to start working on the concept of productivity. 66% of exports to the international market are represented by the agro-industrial and fishing industries. We also have a great share of dairy products, milk, and milk sub products, which represent 33%. We seek to boost the agro-industrial segment; that is our priority. We hand out awards to producers of bananas, honey, and all products related to this industry. It is also important to add value to our production.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Representatives of the industry sector confirm this view by stressing the need to have a policy to boost productivity, competitiveness and the overall development of the industrial and agro-industrial sectors. Well reflected policies and measures in this regard would impact the economic efficiency of the production chain in the short, medium, and long term, ultimately allowing Panamanian exports to recover in the regional and global market.</p>
<h4>A new industrial Law</h4>
<p>In order to achieve greater diversification of the national economy and promote industrial production by supporting its competitiveness, in March 2017 the government and the private sector agreed on a new bill, which modifies Law 76 of 2009 by expanding tax incentives granted to companies in the sector through the Certificate of Industrial Promotion. The bill, which was approved by the cabinet, introduces an increase of 25 to 40% in tax credits for investment in manufacturing and agribusiness. The reform supports R&amp;D, personnel training, investment and reinvestment, and environmental management. Also, the issuance of the certificate will be possible in 90 days instead of the current two years. With the new law, companies registered with the National Industry registry were granted an extension until December 31, 2017 for tax benefits, which were to expire on December 31, 2016. These incentives are expected to boost investments in the industry sector starting in 2017.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/32f627c9-ca5a-408b-8528-6edb54f373b2.jpg","","","","","","Industry","strategic-realignment","1479","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784059","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-21T10:20:00.000Z","2017-06-21T10:20:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Have a Dig","<p>The recently opened Cobre Panama copper mine is expected to become one of the world's largest open-pit copper mines, and a number of other projects are currently being developed as well. All the while, the Panamanian government is working to form a mining structure that will allow for investment but ensure that the nation's mineral resources work to the benefit of its citizens.</p><h4>HIS STORY</h4><p>Access to Panama's mineral resources is governed through the 1963 Code of Mineral Resources, which established a concessions system that remains in place to this day. Concessions are granted through the Ministry of Commerce and Industries' Directorate General of Mineral Resources (DGMR), which oversees the industry. Most concessions are granted for 20 or 25 years depending on the metal, with the possibility of up to 25 years of extensions available through the DGMR. While there have been issues over regulations allowing mining concerns on native lands, Panama's mining structure is largely in line with Latin American norms. A series of fixed surface and royalties taxes are levied on producers to generate revenue for the state and surrounding communities.</p><p>While the structure has been in place for decades, large-scale mining had been largely nonexistent until 15 years ago. Smaller semi-legal mining operations have been in production since colonial times, but the only commercial mine currently operational is the Canadian-owned Molejon gold mine, operated by Canadian firm Petaquilla. Production at the Molejon site, which has proven mineral reserves of over 640,000oz of gold, began in 2009 at 2,200 tons per day, growing to 3,500 tons per day by 2012 before closing in 2013 due to funding problems; a failure to pay. In 2016, however, US minerals firm Diamante Minerals formed an agreement with Canadian operator Petaquilla Gold and contractor Blendcore to restart operations at the mine. Diamante will earn a 12.5% royalty and the right to provide funding for expansion should the need arise. As of early 2017, operations on the stockpiled ore have been slow to begin, and Diamante was exploring its options to purchase the Molejon mine outright.</p><p>COPPER MINE</p><p>The centerpiece of Panama's mining industry is the Cobre Panama open-pit copper mine, which is currently under construction 120km west of Panama City. Developed by Minera Panama and its parent organization Canadian First Quantum Minerals, the USD5.95 billion project is expected to become one of the world's largest copper mines upon the beginning of production in early 2018. The concession site, which is 13,600ha over four separate zones, is home to the largest undeveloped copper deposit in the world, with proven and probable reserves of over 3 billion metric tons grading 0.38% copper, 0.07 oz/mt gold, and 1.43 oz/mt silver. Canadian firm Inmet began planning and construction in 2011, but First Quantum took control of the project after acquiring Inmet and has proceeded with an even more ambitious development plan. First Quantum projects that Cobre Panama will produce 328,000 tons per year of copper over the first 20 years of the life of the mine and 228,000 tons per year for the remainder of the life of the mine. This would make Cobre Panama one of the 15 largest copper-producing mines in the world and easily the largest in Central America. </p><p>First Quantum Country Manager Todd Clewett is well aware of the economic significance the mine will have and already has in Panama. “At current prices [Cobre Panama] represents a USD2 billion export value for the country,"" Clewett told TBY. “The future impact of the project aside, the project also contributes a great deal to the country today; our budget is over USD1 billion for 2017, we employ over 5,500 Panamanians at the site, and our salary bill including social security amounts to about USD17 million per month. In the past 12 months, we have spent around USD170 million on purchases from Panamanian suppliers and have contracts and commercial arrangements with about 500 Panamanian companies. Therefore, on a macro level, we already have a large economic impact on the country before we even produce.""</p><p>To support the Cobre Panama project, First Quantum has embarked on two key infrastructure projects. The first is the construction of an international port 27km north of the mine, which is currently being used to transport construction materials and will eventually be the main site of mineral transport. The second is a power station, which will have two 160MW turbines to power the mine. First Quantum has signed an agreement with the Panamanian government to sell its excess electricity to the national grid. Expected to be operational by mid-2017, the power plant should become a key source of energy for the surrounding communities.</p><p>The scope of the Cobre Panama Project and First Quantum's commitment to turning it into a global leader have given it the potential to have a massive impact on all sectors of Panamanian life. The mine's projected export volumes would make copper Panama's single-largest export, and the size and impact of the site has already transformed surrounding communities. While First Quantum is using an in-house construction process, more than 1,000 local Panamanians are working at the site and First Quantum is keenly aware of its social responsibility to bring economic growth to the region. “In the last 12 months, we have also made a commitment to build a training facility in La Pintada,"" Clewett told TBY. “We are also looking to develop 500 new houses in that area over the next few years to provide for the operational workforce… We are spending a large amount of money, and this has had tangible changes in the area, in the growth of Penonomé and La Pintada."" First Quantum has also sought to alleviate fears about the environmental impact of the mine by initiating reforesting projects and working with local activists to protect the biodiversity of the region. These are all signs indicating that Cobre Panama should bring economic growth to the region.</p><h4>GLOBAL COPPER MARKET<br></h4><p>Ultimately, the success of the Cobre Panama mine may well be dependent on global copper prices. The commodities boom for the mid-2000s, which sparked the resurgent interest in Panama's mineral resources, has petered out in recent years, with copper prices falling dramatically over the past five years due to decreased demand from China and other key markets. A rise in early 2017 has industry participants optimistic about the future of the sector, but it remains to be seen whether this will be a sustained level or a one-off. Either way, First Quantum and the Panamanian government are confident that the potential of the Cobre Panama site and Panama's excellent logistical ties to the global industry will make the nation's mining sector a rising industry in the years to come. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Panama's mining sector has traditionally not had the economic impact that its shipping, banking, and tourism industries have had, but that may be beginning to change.","","Mining","have-a-dig","3160","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784059","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2015, the average rental price of a warehouse in Panama exceeded USD9 per sqm while the average sale price of industrial parks reached USD1,580,00 per sqm. Capital.com.pa noted that the Costa del Este y Centro area is characterized by the highest prices. Industrial parks maintained an average price of USD1,500 per sqm for Class A warehouses, while those in the Class B segment registered an increase in sale price, going from USD1,080,00 per sqm in 2015 to USD1,200,00 in 2016. As far as the average sizes are involved, Class A warehouses typically start from 500sqm to a maximum size of 1,500sqm while the typical size of a Class B warehouse is around 900sqm; certain industrial parks even offer the possibility of creating build-to-order spaces.</p><p>The occupancy rate of industrial warehouses reached an average of 94.6%, or over 40,000sqm occupied, especially to the east of the capital and in Panama Pacifico, with an average of 15,000sqm. In 2015, Arturo Lopez, Vice-President at the Division of New Projects Development at Grupo Corporativo Perez, shared with TBY the investment of the holding in the construction of a new, leading logistic park, commenting, “Parque Logistico Panama is an investment focused on real estate, logistics, and industry. As a group, we distribute cars and parts; logistics is in our blood. Parque Logistico Panama is a world-class investment of world-class quality. What we have here is a real eco-friendly park; we have different services and products; however, the most important fact is that we are the best private park in the country. One of the leading advantages is our location. We are close to the airport, which is vital for certain industry types, such as pharmaceuticals. For pharmaceuticals, it is critical to move products; therefore, we have an advantage in that segment. Half of our park is a FTZ; therefore, we have a number of customers that look not only for the Panamanian market, but also see Panama as a hub. We have, for example, manufacturing companies in the FTZ. They are manufacturing here to supply the domestic market, but a great part of their products will supply the rest of the region—Central America and the Caribbean mainly.""</p><p>The undergoing construction of industrial and logistic parks will add over 391,000sqm to this expanding market: the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is one of the drivers and promoters of this growth. It is now working on a new master plan to boost the logistic performance of the Interoceanic Zone that will feature more warehouses, logistics, and industrial parks to manage the increasing cargo that passes through the expanded Canal.</p><p>The availability and construction of industrial and logistic parks is a fundamental factor and indicator taken in consideration when analyzing the level of competitiveness of a country. Because of its solid infrastructure of industrial and logistic parks, Panama boasts major logistics competitiveness in Latin America and is among the top 25% of countries with the highest rating globally. During a conversation with TBY, Miguel Angel Esbri, National Secretary of the Competitiveness &amp; Logistics Secretariat, commented on the results, stating “Panama improved its position in the World Economic Forum rankings by an impressive jump of eight positions. We are only nine positions away from Chile (33) and overall, this has been a massive success for Panama. The main objective of the secretariat is for Panama to become the most competitive economy in Latin America in 2019—Chile tops that list at the moment. However, it is worth mentioning that in the World Bank's Doing Business Report, Panama lost three positions—we currently rank 70th and are the sixth Latin American economy.

On March 29, 2016, the National Energy Plan (NEP) 2015-2050 was approved under the motto “Panama, the future we want“ and promoted by the National Energy Secretariat. This plan is divided into two subsections: the first is a short-term operational plan for 2015-2019, specifying the specific plans for that period, while the second, the National Energy Plan Scenarios 2015-2020, includes details on price forecasts and demand, as well as the role of companies in the sector.</p><p>The NEP, which outlines the methodology of production and distribution of energy in the country, is the result of consensus reached after 16 sessions coordinated by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Energy Secretariat, which involved more than 800 people from the public sector, indigenous communities, the private sector, and civil society. Some of the key points are based on the proposal that at least 70% of the electricity matrix by 2050 will come from renewable sources, with emphasis on solar and wind energies.<br>Also of note is the current government's plan to achieve energy savings by 2019 equivalent to the power generation of a hydroelectric plant, as well as a strategy to distribute generation plants in an equitable and adequate way to achieve universal consumption throughout the country. These obligations for the Panamanian government also include promoting transparency and fair competition within the sector in order to achieve a fair price situation for consumers.</p><p>Panama is taking the right steps to achieve a decarbonization of its energy matrix, adapting to wind and solar projects. In addition, Panama's authorities have announced the country will no longer construct hydroelectric plants because the use of water for that purpose has reached its limits, and they advocate other renewable and clean energy sources. Panama currently has a wind farm located in the central province of Coclé and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) power generation plant in the Caribbean province of Colón, with a production of 270MW and 350MW, respectively.</p><p>National Energy Secretary Ví­ctor Urrutia had said the energy sector will need an investment of more than USD11.2 billion by 2050 to meet an annual energy demand, which is expected to grow at a rate of 4.9%. During an interview with TBY, Secretary Urrutia stressed the importance that the application of new technologies in the field of renewables will play in the diversification of the national matrix composition. “According to our statistics, Panama today produces 70% of its electricity using renewables sources, the majority of them come from hydroelectric power stations. Wind power is imposing itself as a valid alternative towards the diversification of the matrix; it is also a great generator of energy, especially during the dry season, when the performance of our hydro plants is affected by the lack of rain. The 270MW wind farm close to Penenomí¨, which will be fully operative in 2017, is a great example of the importance of wind power for the country.“<br>To achieve all these goals, the NEP also contemplates a series of tax incentives for companies that promote and/or develop the use of solar and wind energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and the provision of electricity.

"2017-06-21T05:41:00.000Z","2017-06-20T23:00:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Running on Renewables","","","","","","","","<p>As Panama continues to enjoy sizable growth in its broader economy, the energy sector will continue to be a key driver of development. The economic health of the country translates into heavy demand growth in the energy sector, and demand is expected to jump between 4.5 and 6% a year until 2030, or 50MW every year. New home construction, large infrastructure projects, the expansion of the Panama Canal, and the metro line are forecast to be the major drivers of demand.</p>
<p>In order to meet this demand, the country has rededicated itself to producing mor</p>
<p>e energy from a diverse range of sources. Stakeholders in both government and private industry are working to ensure that Panama's energy sector is diversified, stable, affordable, and consistent. The country's energy matrix relies on three key areas: hydropower, hydrocarbons, and alternative sources. Nearly 63% of Panama's energy matrix comes from hydropower, while hydrocarbons account for 35% and alternatives roughly 2%. The state-owned company Empresa de Transmissi&oacute;n El&eacute;ctrica (ETESA) is the only transmission firm. According to the US government, the net cost to electricity consumers is around USD1.4/kwh.</p>
<h4>Natural Gas</h4>
<p>Panama has been working to bring widespread and easily accessible natural gas to its citizens. The country started construction on Central America's first gas-powered generation plant in May of 2016. The facility, the construction of which is being overseen by AES Panama, will generate 381MW of power and will incorporate 180,000cbm of storage capacity. The government hopes that this facility will be a the first step towards establishing Panama as a hub for liquified natural gas in the region. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Miguel Bolinga, President of AES Panama, discussed the potential this project has for Panama. &ldquo;We are in an important position to increase the competitiveness of the country as an energy hub within the region,"" said Bolinga. &ldquo;This new power plant will allow Panama to produce cheap energy that can be sold in Colombia, and once the connection is made, Panama will play an important role in the development of the energy sector, not only on a national scale but regionally as well.""</p>
<p>The project is expected to generate between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs over its course. By locating the project near the canal, AES Panama hopes that the facility will become a key part of not only Panama's energy sector but the energy market of the entire region. The facility is expected to receive more than a dozen tankers a year. General Electric is a major partner of AES Panama on the project, and the company is supplying core equipment, including state-of-the-art gas turbines that are expected to increase the efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of operations.</p>
<h4>Hydropower</h4>
<p>With its bountiful supply of waterways and resources, hydropower is a key part of Panama's energy puzzle, and one that promises to remain in the spotlight for years to come. Large-scale hydro plants generated 53.5%, or 9.5TWh, of the country's energy while small-scale facilities accounted for 12.3%. The sector is supported by the nation's 31 dams, but 54 new dams are in the works. The impressive growth has not been without some resistance, however, and environmental groups have voiced their opposition to some of the projects. According to Circle of Blue, Panamanian hydro has added around 100MW of generating capacity every year since 2005.<br />The heavy reliance of Panama's energy matrix on hydropower can leave the system susceptible to drought. In 2014, the country experienced a drought that put severe pressure on the generation grid. In response, the government has attempted to expand and diversify its energy portfolio to better insulate itself against such shocks.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>Panama's energy matrix is in the midst of sizable changes, transitioning from an energy network based on hydropower and fossil fuels to one founded on renewables like solar and wind. Panama has become a leader in renewable and alternative energy in the region, and a relatively large percentage of its energy matrix is already derived from these sources. The government hopes to derive 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. The country's National Energy Plan 2015-2050 pushes that number to 70% by 2050. Between 2011 and 2015 Panama invested roughly USD1.4 billion in clean energy. The country has developed a robust set of incentives aimed at bolstering its alternative energy sector, including a premium payment schedule for alternative-derived energy and tax incentives aimed at supporting small-scale alternative producers. Biomass, hydro up to 3MW, wind, and solar receive a 5% premium. A series of auctions have been held to award contracts for renewable projects, particularly wind, and nearly 400MW of generation infrastructure has been awarded since 2011. Additionally, the wind sector receives 15-year tax exemptions for companies based out of Panama that manufacture equipment necessary for the industry. While multiple contracts for solar generation have been awarded in recent years, few projects have begun construction. Companies with projects of 0.5MW or less receive value added and import tax exemptions, and exemptions from taxes on distribution and transmissions for projects that are 10MW or less. Additionally, net metering was implemented in 2012, and retail consumers with renewable production capabilities of up to 500kW will be allowed to put surplus energy back into the system and be paid for it. This incentive structure, the stable currency system and the country's strategic location and logistics experience have been key drivers of growth in the renewable energy sector, attracting investors from around the world.</p>
<p>Wind energy has been another exciting area of growth in Panama's energy sector, and some large-scale projects have gotten close to completion. The country's first wind farm, located on the Pacific coast, will be capable of generating 55MW of capacity, and it is set to be completed later this year. In 2016, solar energy firms saw a large spike in growth around Panama, and many firms and individuals are beginning to recognize the utility of having renewables as a part of their energy consumption matrix. In addition to highlighting the environmental benefits of renewables, firms in Panama are appealing to the cost-consciousness of business when trying to boost renewable energy production and consumption.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, Jorge Vialette, Director for Central American and the Caribbean for Faro Energy, discussed the value that green energy can have for a company's bottom line and how his firm is trying to capitalize on this. &ldquo;We own and operate renewable energy generating plants that provide cheaper energy to the end customer,"" said Vialette. &ldquo;Our value proposition is that businesses can become more profitable by gaining access to lower energy costs from day one, and by consuming solar-generated energy, the customer is doing his part to protect the environment."" Firms of all sizes have begun recognizing the value of including renewable energy sources in their consumption portfolio, and the private sector is turning more and more toward these options.</p>
<p>Greenwood Energy, a leading solar energy firm, has seen growing demand for its products in a wide array of sectors across the Panamanian economy. Supermarkets, hospitals, large and medium-scale manufacturing, agriculture, and animal husbandry have all been identified as potential rich sources for future growth. Efficient and cost-effective battery technology is widely seen as the next crucial step in ensuring that Panama's wind and solar technology achieve widespread implementation and nationwide ubiquity. Energy firms are branching into this technology in Panama and taking steps to ensure that high-tech batteries become central pieces of the Panamanian energy puzzle.</p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/content/article/f95fd235-f725-438c-a293-6334f89635f3.jpg","","","","As Panama seeks to transform its energy matrix, renewables are becoming an ever greater piece of the puzzle, allowing the country to become a leader in clean energy in Central America.","","","running-on-renewables","1756","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784058","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-21T04:58:00.000Z","2017-06-21T04:58:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Trading on Transparency","<p>Panama's story, within the space of a few decades, is one of remarkable transition from financial opacity to favored destination for FDI and home to rigidly regulated capital markets. IMF data reveals that while for 2016 global growth printed at 3.1% and Latin America and the Caribbean shrank -0.7%, Panama, floated by investor confidence and economic diversity, outperformed both on GDP growth of 4.9%, ranking second in the Americas. In short, the hugely internationalized economy has added to its logistics backbone the meat of financial integrity, shedding its less-than-salubrious former reputation. This is evidenced in a 2016 FDI print of USD5.209.3 billion, exceeding the 2015 figure by 15.9%. Meanwhile, Panama's financial market development was ranked 15th in the world by the World Economic Forum's 2015-2016 Global Competitiveness Report. It also ranked 40th for financing through the local equity market.</p><h4>Visibly Enhanced</h4><p>Transparency is the byword for the Open Government policy, wherein the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) monitors financial sector accountability. Dulcidio de la Guardia, Minister of Economy and Finance, explained to TBY that “Panama has complied with the recommendations of the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF), in 2015 getting off the gray list of this agency."" More recently, in October 2016 Panama became a signatory to the Convention on Administrative Assistance on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC), depositing “the instruments of ratification on March 16 of 2017, making us one of the countries that implemented this instrument the fastest.""</p><h4>Despite International Ripples and Local Bumps</h4><p>Inevitably perhaps, there are hiccups to the best-laid plans, the wide-reaching Panama Papers leak standing out among them. Meanwhile, locally, capital markets blushed in February 2017 with the confidence-bruising indefinite suspension of bond issuer Cheque Efectivo by the stock exchange due to its revealed liquidity woes. Another major story epitomizes the ideal synergy between the capital markets, the real economy, and the government, or alternatively, the sheer potential for contagion. In 2016 Aeropuerto Internacional de Tocumen S.A. (AITSA) placed USD575 million of 20-year bonds with a 5.625% coupon maturing in 2036. The objective was to raise the funds necessary to complete the south terminal and related works of the airport, a wholly owned government entity whose chairman of the board is the Minister of Economy and Finance. In May 2016 Fitch rated the instrument 'BBB' and 'AAA (pan)' with 'stable' outlook. Fitch also affirmed at 'BBB' AITSA's 2013 USD650 million senior secured debt due in 2023, revising the outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' in the wake of the successful placement of the USD575 million instrument: So far so normal. Yet two subsequent developments, by association, potentially rocked the credit quality of AITSA's financial obligations. First was the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) linking of Consorcio Grupo Wisa and affiliates operating duty-free stores at the airport with irregularity and narcotics trafficking. The second development was a downgrading to 'B+' with 'Negative' outlook of Odebrecht Engenharia e Construcao, the holding company of the contractor building the south terminal, for potential contractor default.</p><h4>ThE Bourse</h4><p>But taking a broader perspective, let us focus on the sunnier side of the capital markets street, which the all-important investor community certainly seems to do. The Panama Stock Exchange, Bolsa de Valores de Panamá (BVP), was born at a time of political and economic adversity from forward-thinking members of the business community keen to harness the catalytic effect that capital markets would have on the broader economy, if astutely developed and transparently executed. The first bell clanged on June 26, 1990, a year in which trading volume printed at just USD3.3 million. Yet as the bourse celebrated its sweet-16, the figure came in at USD2.256 billion. And by 2011 the MCap of domestic listed entities had scaled USD10.7 billion. Underpinning this performance was the nation's new climate of stable business enabled by the investor sentiment that can only emanate from political stability. That in turn reflected in comprehensive economic reform and a tax environment conducive to business so as to shore up shortfalls in capital market development, notably including the digitalization of trading, clearing, and liquidation. The BVP, regulated by the Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores de Panamá, argues that its more intimate scale enables greater flexibility in accommodating would-be listed firms. What's more, in its move toward becoming a financial hub, it offers the low operating costs appealing to international listings. Roughly 20 fund management firms today operate in Panama, predominantly foreign-owned entities. The appeal, too, is that while regulations stipulate at least one resident director, service providers by law may be based anywhere in the world, so long as they are in a jurisdiction recognized by the Panamanian financial authorities.</p><h4>Growth Strategy </h4><p>Olga Cantillo, the Vice President and General Manager of the BVP, revealed that in 2016 the bourse accounted for just 20% of total investment volume, with the bulk stemming from foreign exchange trading. In fact, as a nation, “we have always been oriented to the banking sector and its savings culture [although today the BVP is] working on an education strategy for the long term with the objective of being foremost in mind not only for investment purposes, but also as an employment opportunity for the younger generation."" Parallel to local steps is a wider regional footprint to deepen the capital markets and gain global traction. “We are in the process of launching the market integration between the stock exchanges of El Salvador and Panama,"" Cantillo adds, which “will allow the approved stock members of each country to trade in the other country's exchange system without double registration of the securities listed in each country.""</p><h4>Go Figure</h4><p>2016 was a record breaker for the BVP, as issuances in the January-September period alone surpassed 60% of the total issuances of FY2015, with the bourse bullishly forecasting FY2017 total trades of USD7 billion. Official data for the full year indicates that BVP transactions soared 40% YoY to over USD7.3 billion compared to USD5.246 billion traded in 2015. Specifically, transactions on the primary market climbed 15.7% YoY to USD3.934 billion, with the Senior Secured Bonds of Tocumen International Airport, at USD625 million, delivering a full 20% of the total. Meanwhile, the secondary market appreciated 44%, from USD1.51248 billion in 2015 to USD2.18289 billion</p><p>The benchmark BVPSI Index was forecast by Trading Economics closing 2Q2017 at 413, and 1Q2018 at 401. By YE2016 the BVP had registered 38 new issues valued overall at USD3.021 billion, thereby exceeding the 29 registered in 2015 worth USD1.9184 billion. And for 1Q2017, of the total volume traded at the BVP 55% was generated in the primary market, with 29% in the secondary market and the remainder being repurchases. In the primary market the most traded instruments were corporate bonds, notes, and negotiable commercial securities of USD338.9 million, followed by bonds and Treasury Bills of USD228.8 million. Data also shows trading of USD20.1 million in the shares of mutual funds plus USD9.9 million in common stock and USD198 thousand in preferred shares. Meanwhile, in the secondary market, government securities ruled the roost on a trading volume of USD158.6 million, ahead of corporate debt comprising bonds, notes, and negotiable commercial securities on USD104.7 million, and lastly variable yield instruments of USD76.1 million. On March 14, Panama issued USD125 million in government debt on the local market, maturing in 2024 and with an average yield of 3.63%. Firm demand came from public-sector entities, prompted both by the instrument's good return and favorable credit risk status.</p><p>Panama's capital markets, now rigorously scrutinized, can expect further investor attention as the nation adjusts to its status as a regional finance hub. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The BVP is the flagship of Panama's capital markets, which have themselves arisen with the rigors of regulation from the nation's unenviable past.","","Capital Markets","trading-on-transparency","1563","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IMF has predicted global growth in the order of 3.1% for 2016, which is considered a moderate product of the deceleration in world trade. Meanwhile, the Latin American region and the Caribbean as a whole recorded an economic recession (-0.7%). Despite this, Panama recorded GDP growth of 4.9% for 2016, according to official figures of the National Institute of Statistics and Census, making it the second-fastest growing country in the Americas in terms of economic growth and one of the highest in the world.</p><p>In order to achieve its growth target, the government is investing and promoting Panama as a reliable and transparent platform. 2016 will be remember as the year of the “Panama Papers,“ which significantly impacted the country's reputation in the international arena. Local institutions, however, promptly reacted to boost and renew the image of the country as a safe and transparent financial hub.</p><p>Elizabeth L. Heurtematte de Alfaro, Partner at Lovill, confirmed to TBY the immediate impact of the Panama Papers scandal on the international community of investors: “The Panama Papers affected the general perception of the country; however, companies and individuals seeking to do business have not been that concerned by it. They are more concerned about the state of the market, the opportunities, the legal framework, and how they can grow their business.“</p><p>Rolando J. de Leon de Alba, General Manager at Banco Nacional de Panama, stressed that “Panama has taken many steps to promote transparency, fairness, and comply with the standards set by the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the OEC. That is where the country made the biggest improvement this year (…). When something like this happens, it threatens the system.“ </p><p>The World Bank supports the ambitious reform program promoted by Panama's government in terms of transparency; it approved a USD300 million loan to support the country's efforts toward strengthening and consolidating international tax transparency, financial integrity, and fiscal management. Furthermore, the loan seeks to improve social programs, among other services, to ensure that 60% of the population living in extreme poverty benefit from at least one welfare program.</p><p>In order to improve the exchange of international tax information, Panama has committed itself, through this operation, to adopt globally accepted standards for the exchange of financial information with other countries, namely the Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (CRS). In other words, ownership and identity of information, including sensitive accounting records, if needed, will be available to all related institutions.</p><p>According to international organization, improvements in fiscal management will also underpin the continuity of the robust growth that Panama has been enjoying over the last decade, as they promote “a stable macroeconomic framework and sound debt management based on fiscal prudence.“ In that regard, Dulcidio de la Guardia, Minister of Economy and Finance, commented: “The transparency of Panama and its financial system is the key to attracting investors for the country. Therefore, the country has been subject to the evaluations of financial regulators such as FATF to ensure our commitment to the fight against money laundering and terrorism.</p><p>In this regard, Panama has complied with the recommendations of the FATF and in 2015 was removed from the agency's gray list, since it has the regulatory and institutional framework defined in an action plan for the prevention of money laundering, terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In order to increase financial transparency and improve the country's reputation, the government adapted the legislation of the country in a short time to changing international standards and expanded its network of treaties and tax and trade agreements. The real challenge for Panama now is to not only implement the changes but to evolve into a financial hub where transparency becomes an opportunity rather than a risk for the expansion of the sector and its contribution to growth. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Transparency","clear-as-glass","1510","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An increasing number of LEED-certified buildings has made Panama one of the most sustainable countries within Central America: there is a clear and evident commitment by the government, the private sector, and international organizations, such as IFC and the Panama Green Council to promote a new culture in the construction sector, boosting the concept of green architecture and minimizing the impact on the local environment. The construction industry grew significantly in 2016, accounting for 14.8% of GDP in Panama. There are 30 projects officially certified with the LEED green building standard, which is still the most widely used standard in the world. There also have 80-85 projects in the certification pipeline, which places Panama in second place in terms of green building certifications in all of Central America, only behind Costa Rica.</p><p>An important step for the green revolution is represented by the approval of Law No. 69 in October 2012. The new regulation, known as UREE, imposes new general standards “for the rational and efficient use of energy in the national territory.“ The new law includes robust auditing for the construction of new buildings that will allow for the comparison, monitoring, and tracking of the energy consumption and performance of a building.<br>IFC plays a fundamental role in the development of new energy standards: IFC signed a strategic alliance with Panama's government to design a new regulatory framework that will boost the eco efficiency of Panama's buildings and the reduction of water and energy consumption in all the new buildings that will be constructed in the country. Given that urban areas and cities consume 75% of the world's natural resources and that 80% of the world's population is expected to be living in cities and large urban areas by 2050, the issue of sustainable construction in cities is more crucial than ever.</p><p>Roberto Forte Taylor, Director at the Green Building Council Panama, is one of the promoters of the new green revolution that is transforming the approach to the sector. In an interview with TBY he noted, “The sustainable construction guide put together by the National Secretary of Energy and the IFC focuses mainly focus on energy efficiency; however, the Eco Protocol will include six or seven distinct efficiency and sustainability categories, including water efficiency, interior air quality, energy efficiency, and green procurement, to name a few. We want to use this protocol to establish the most holistic local certification possible, and we are currently working to implement them at the municipal level. We are working with the mayor and vice-mayor of Panama City right now, and once the Eco Protocol is established there, we hope to implement it in other major urban areas. Additionally, once we have clearly established the technical requirements of the Eco Protocol, we plan on proposing to the Ministry of Environment that it use our protocol as a best practice guide for the entire nation. There has also been some discussion of streamlining the permitting process for projects using green techniques and following our Eco Protocol. This will further incentivize companies to choose green projects and use sustainable techniques. This is the most tangible intra-organizational synergy we are working on right now.“<br>Forte explained that 37% of the council's members are engineering and architectural firms, most of which are local while 29% are product distributors that represent a mix of large multinational and local firms. </p><p>“Interestingly, the companies that seem most interested in being members of the council are lighting providers and paint providers. Solar panel firms are also becoming more popular, and we currently have three member companies that are solar panel providers. Construction and project promoters also make up a fairly large proportion of our membership, and they include local and international firms. New companies are also usually interested in joining the council because they see it as a way of making a competitive differentiation in the market.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SUSTAINABILITY","thinking-of-the-future","1390","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58f615b486b7b00ce8946aa8","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nation has retained the USD as its currency, and in an anomaly of sorts, it lacks a central bank, whereby the banking system, and the currency itself, are entirely market-driven. Subsequently, in 1971 a new banking law sealed in writing the liberal nature of the International Banking Center (IBC), stipulating that interest or transactions generated in the financial system would not be taxed. It is no surprise then that while the sector a year earlier had numbered 23 players, just over a decade later the number was 125, mostly international institutions, and with assets of close to USD50 billion.</p><h4>Reputation, Reputation, Reputation</h4><p>In March 2017, The Latin American Federation of Banks (Felaban) issued certain comments in defense of its sector. Firstly, it opined that it was erroneous to automatically link Panama's financial system with tax havens, while acknowledging that international standards were “mandatory"" to curb illicit capital. The federation added, too, that the now infamous term “Panama Papers"" was misleading in that those involved had broken their own national laws, and not those of Panama. In the latest development regarding Panama's recent debacle, the Superintendency of Banks of Panama (SBP) in March ordered a 30-day extension for the reorganization of the Balboa Bank &amp; Trust with a view to its potential sale. Balboa Bank had last May been under control on the same day that Washington placed Panamanian business group Waked on the proverbial Clinton List of drug lords, along with 68 other firms of Abdul Waked and nephew Nidal Waked, a senior executive of the bank.</p><p>Actually, despite a swathe of reputation-tarnishing revelations, including this year's woes involving construction firm Odebrecht and oil concern Petrobras, the banking system has suffered little tangibly, being self-regulating. In short, in the absence of deposit insurance, or a lender of last resort, strict corporate governance principles are at play. Simply put, bad loans would, otherwise, be borne by the stockholders, anathema to an institution. Yet the Panama Papers did underline persistent failure to tackle anti-money laundering, hence spelling reputational risk for the system per se. Indeed, Panama's financial hub status faces perceived risk from the 30% or so of general licensed bank deposits deriving from abroad, with the potential to be more opaque in origin. The SBP has responded swiftly to the scandals, naming and shaming banks that had received compliance-related fines in the interests of international best practices. The overarching objective is for financial products to be aligned with the principles of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Fitch Ratings, while welcoming such regulatory overtones, maintains a negative sector outlook for Panamanian banks. Nonetheless, while similar risk is observable elsewhere in Latin America, Panama's hugely internationalized economy is mitigating the fallout of recent aberrations. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2016-17 ranked Panama's ability for financial services to meet business needs fifth, and the affordability of its financial services sixth out of 138 countries.</p><p>The Superintendence of Banks is working toward realizing its Quinquennial Plan 2015-2019 to bolster the International Banking Center, based on four pillars. The first involves enhancing risk supervision to address problems early and underpin sector integrity. The second, by adopting Basel II solvency and liquidity standards and fine-tuning transparency mechanisms, envisages safeguarding against financial contagion, thus accentuating broader macroeconomic stability. The final two involve optimizing the sector's human resources to sharpen institutional management, and the competitive adoption of new technology to expand banking penetration among the financially excluded.</p><h4>Banked, but not Evenly</h4><p>A telling anecdote on the potential for broader gender inclusion in Panama's financial universe was shared in a TBY interview with Aimee Sentmat de Grimaldo, the President of Banistmo, the country's second-largest bank, originating in Colombia. She started by revealing that World Bank data ranks Panama among the highest by overall banking penetration, at 88%. Yet, “Interestingly enough, this is not the same for women; 40.2% of whom have an account at a bank,"" while in 2015 “46% of women went to a financial institution seeking credit, and just 11% of that number was able to obtain financing from a formal institution."" As she goes on to explain, this did not signify that they had walked away with no financing, but that worse yet, “they likely approached the informal market, which is extremely expensive."" And pinpointing a large potential SME market to tap, she concluded that while “in terms of small companies, 44% were owned by women, just 4% have access to financing.""</p><p>Meanwhile, referring to an economic sector that employs 40% of the workforce, albeit generating 3% of GDP, Rolando J. de Leon de Alba, the General Manager of Banco Nacional de Panama, confirmed the institution's dedication to that sector's development, where BNP's investment exceeds USD500 million. Its commitment comes from the awareness that the nation needs “to achieve sovereignty regarding the production of our own food."" And while the nation portrays itself “as a service-based country (...) we do not want to forget about the primary sector.""</p><p>Panama's IBC, the regional frontrunner, operating to strict Basel principles, and with liquidity and solvency levels comfortably above those stipulated by banking law, is a key component of the nation's service-driven (c.80% of GDP) economy. At 59.29% by January 2015, for example, the level had all but doubled the stipulated 30%. Established in 1970, today it features 92 banks, employing over 20,000 people, while assets accounted for roughly 10% of GDP in 2016. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of Basel III compliance features a minimum coverage of 60% and with a 10% annual rise until 100% is achieved by January 2019. The system is renowned for its agility, while a sizable international presence expands the footprint and boosts competitiveness. As of 2016 the nation's banking system was comprised 51% of local assets and 49% of foreign assets.</p><p>Assets held by its banking system had grown by over USD4 billion in 1H2016 alone, as the country continues to work towards more transparency in its financial services sector. Total assets printed at USD99.6 billion by end 1H2016, rising 4.6% YoY. In particular, loan portfolios climbed 7.2%, while total deposits of close to USD73.4 billion for the period were up 5.3% YoY. Profitability, nonetheless, was dented by 2.4% to around USD615 million in light of government moves to restore a positive international reputation through stricter checks and balances. According to the Superintendency of Banks, a positive trend is evidenced in domestic loan portfolio growth of 9.3% through November 2016. Loans to the private sector had climbed 9.7% YoY. Encouragingly, too, the decline in foreign loans was interpreted as prudence in times of international uncertainty. As of November 2016, YoY, the strongest growth in total value stemmed from mortgages at USD1.62 billion, followed by consumption, up USD1.34 billion and construction on USD976 million. In terms of the composition of sector debt, mortgages (30%) claimed the lion's share of the market, trailed by commercial loans on 23% and personal consumption on 21%. Mortgages granted amounted to USD14.66 billion, up USD1.62 billion from the same period of 2015. As of November 2016, monthly average liquidity in the local banking universe was at 60%, broken down into state-owned banking at 70.8%, foreign banking at 67.7%, and Panamanian banking at 45.2%, rendering the system resilient to short- and medium-term delinquencies. And at YE2016, total assets of the IBC printed a 3.3% YoY rise, scaling a historic peak of USD121.08 billion. The system boasted a 63.3% liquidity level and 15.2% capital adequacy index. Superintendency data indicates that domestic loans to the private sector portfolio, the main asset in the system, at USD48.63 billion at YE2016, had risen 8% YoY. This was most in evidence in retail banking, where credit cards rose by 19%, consumption loans by 13%, personal loans by 13%, and residential mortgages by 12%. Construction bridge loans, too, grew YoY by a robust 18%. Meanwhile, confirming the system's portfolio pedigree, non-performing loans with a delinquency of over 90 days claimed just 1.2% of the total portfolio.</p><p>It would be remiss not to swiftly mention the leading Panamanian bank, Banco General. It operates 68 branches and roughly 465 ATMs, and has representative offices in Mexico, Central America, and Colombia. For YE2016 it printed total assets of USD16.4 billion, up YoY from USD14.8 billion. As at YE2016 total loans of USD10.8 billion were up 10.4% YoY, while deposits received from customers, up 7.5% YoY were at USD10.8 billion.  In late October 2016, Fitch Ratings affirmed its viability rating (VR) at 'BBB+', and its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+' with a stable outlook. The ratings were driven by its vibrant franchise and dominance of most business segments and products. The agency also noted sustained profitability where loan growth had averaged at 11.1% between 2013 and 2015, relatively stable interest margins, and low credit costs. And as of June 2016, non-performing loans were at a negligible 0.98%.</p><p>Panama has its work cut out to salvage a dented reputation, or perhaps better yet, establish a new one far removed from the ask-no-questions era. This it is fortunately endeavoring to do. In concrete terms, its financial universe is already resilient to the slings and arrows of international travails. This renders it the bedrock of sustained growth in the broader, yet predominantly services-driven economy. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/06ab064d-6f02-4b21-8e12-4d64c99df84f.jpg","","","","Panama's regimented banks continue to play a vital role in credit intermediation between savers and investors.

The largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere outside of the Amazon Basin can also be found in Panama, and 500 rivers flow through the country, many of which are a source of hydroelectric energy.</p><p>To protect its precious natural resources, the government encourages, recognizes, and rewards green initiatives in several sectors, including real estate and construction, logistics and transportation, and energy. Moreover, numerous conservation agencies, both indigenous and international, operate in Panama to preserve its wildlife and spearhead sustainable development. As a result of these efforts combined, deforestation has been reduced by 18% since the 1990s.</p><p>With the country's high levels of solar radiation, extensive hydraulic capacity, and exceptional wind conditions in the central region, Panama boasts prime conditions to develop renewable and sustainable energy. This shift could propel Panama into a position as a regional leader by complementing the Central American energy matrix, thus helping to balance prices in Nicaragua and Guatemala.</p><h4>ENERGY SHIFT</h4><p>Currently, about 65% of Panama's annual energy supply is produced from renewable sources, with hydroelectric and wind power comprising the largest portion. About 35% is sourced from thermal and carbon-based sources. Public-sector investment in renewables is high, with tax benefits and clear regulation in place to inspire private investment into the mix. However, interest from the private sector has been lackluster at best, with private sector renewable energy operators such as Solarcentury identifying a need to attract more FDI to the sector. “It is crucial that more international investors come to the country to boost the efforts and initiatives to invest in renewable energy in Panama,"" Enrique de Ramon, Managing Director of Latin American for Solarcentury, told TBY. Until then, the energy supply mix is on an evolving trajectory, maintaining traditional thermal resources alongside more sustainable initiatives. </p><p>A new coal-fired plant and three new gas-fired plants are on the way over the next five years. “Panama currently has a maximum demand of approximately 1,700MW and the gas projects are large, averaging around 500MW each, so if we have two or three of those projects, it significantly changes the profile of the sector with the majority of current oil-fired capacity becoming obsolete,"" Patrick Kelly, Chairman and CEO of Panama Power Holdings, explained. Panama Power Holdings is a hydroelectric energy supplier with four ongoing projects, striving to help shift the energy matrix to sustainable sources, with an initial offering of 120MW and USD250,000 of investment in corporate social responsibility programs. While gas-fired plants are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels, their incorporation into the energy mix signifies that Panama will not aim for a 100%-renewable energy production target.</p><p>The first step for many energy producers will be to convert from coal fired to gas fired. For CELSIA's complexes at Chiriquí­ and Bahia de las Minas, the process of transformation will begin with contracts that expire in 2018, marking the start of new long-term bidding. “That process of transformation includes the conversion toward gas,"" Javier Gutierrez, General Director of CELSIA, explained to TBY. The company already operates hydroelectric generation centers and a solar plant of 40-60MW in Chiriquí­.</p><p>Although only comprising 1% of the current energy matrix, solar is emerging as a low-cost generation alternative for Panama. The government has supported solar through legislation issued in 2013, which includes fiscal incentives and special tenders for solar projects exclusively. “We have a nascent solar industry here; it is young, but has tremendous potential and a great deal of diversity. In 2016, we founded the Chamber of Panamanian Solar Energy, which brings together the different companies in the sector,"" Juan Carlos Navarro, CEO of NSOLAR, told TBY. The chamber aims to become an active promoter of solar energy, seizing the opportunity to capitalize on renewable generation in Panama, a country that lacks proven carbon resources.<br>Many solar companies that have chosen to invest in Panama have done so for two main reasons: the stability of the political system and the reliability of a dollarized economy. For Solarcentury, an influential regional operator, Panama also makes an exceptional base for exporting solar technology. “It is extremely attractive for international investment. Also, it is in a great location in terms of logistics in the region. This is a great place to be based for regional logistics, with great infrastructure and connections,"" Managing Director Enrique de Ramon emphasized.</p><p>Faro Energy and InnoVent are two private-sector companies that offer solar energy solutions for clients seeking self-sustainable options, or “self-consumption."" This option gives clients the opportunity to reduce the impact of energy cost in their operations. Faro Energy owns and operates renewable energy plants that provide less expensive energy directly to the end customer, through contracts that typically stipulate the construction of a facility on site. “Our value proposition is that businesses can become more profitable by gaining access to lower energy costs from day one. Also, customers hedge against rising energy prices, while investing more predictable profits to expand their business and creating jobs,"" Jorge Vialette, Director for Central America and the Caribbean of Faro Energy, told TBY.</p><p>In April 2017, Italian power provider Enel connected the 42MW Sol Real project to Panama's grid. The plant is expected to sell power to Enel's 300MW Fortuna hydroelectric power station, generating around 70 million GWh of electricity per year. The USD55 million project consists of five subunits: the 5MW Caldera Solar and the 8MW Sol de David, the 11MW Sol Real, the 10MW Milton Solar, and the 8MW Vista Alegre. Now Panama's largest photovoltaic plant, the project is the second of its kind in Panama—the company previously installed the 12MW Fortuna plant in Chiriquí­, which came online in 2015. Both projects were developed by the company's local branch, Enel Green Power Panamá.</p><h4>GREEN CONNECTION</h4><p>The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) announced the launch of the Green Connection Award in 2016, an initiative that “recognizes customers who demonstrate excellent environmental stewardship and encourage others to implement technology and standards that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""</p><p>The environmental standards are set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as well as other globally recognized institutions, with candidates evaluated based on specific environmental factors, such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), the Environmental Ship Index (ESI), the amount of nitrous oxides they emit due to engine performance, whether or not the vessel is powered by LNG, and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions reduced by using the Panama Canal compared to alternate routes.</p><p>The ACP's decision to establish the Green Connection Award falls in line with an ongoing commitment to sustainability. With the widening of the canal in recent years, Panama now offers unmatched advantages in terms of mitigating the environmental impact of shipping operations. In total, the canal has directly contributed to the reduction of 650 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the past century. Now, thanks to the shorter traveling distance and larger cargo carrying capacity that the expansion offers, a further 160 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions are slated to be prevented over the coming decade.</p><p>The ACP is dedicated to the management and operation of the canal, including the preservation of its natural watershed resources. Along with the adoption of international standards and the incorporation of innovative environmental initiatives, the ACP is guaranteeing safe drinking water resources for the 2 million Panamanians it serves. As part of the route's expansions, the canal now features 18 state-of-the-art water-savings basins that recycle 60% of water used at the locks, registering savings of over 7% compared to the canal's previous incarnation.</p><h4>BUILD FRIENDLY</h4><p>Panamanian builders are also seeking ways to contribute toward making Panama's economy more green. From international certification to local innovation, the country is a pioneer in terms of environmentally friendly construction in the region.</p><p>LEED certification has been available in Panama since 2006, with 25 projects achieving the recognition as of late 2016. Among these are the Panamanian Association of Company Executives (Apede), Bladex offices, shopping malls in Ciudad del Saber and Soho Mall, MMG Bank and MMG Tower constructions, Oceania 23C, Banco General de Versalles, and the National Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation. Taking into consideration all of the green building initiatives currently underway, the number of LEED certifications is likely to reach 68 over the medium term, allowing Panama to claim second place after Costa Rica in terms of number of LEED-certified buildings in the region.</p><p>Innovators have also used Panama as a testing ground for ways to repurpose plastic bottles as residential building insulation material. Approximately 120 homes are to be insulated by thousands of plastic bottles recovered from the waste stream. Known as the Plastic Bottle Village, the goal or the community is to create an education center that will educate others on how to reuse plastic bottles as construction materials. New homes in the eco-village are priced between USD149,000 and USD300,000, with each using over 10,000 polyethylene terephthalate bottles inside the walls. According to the company, the use of plastic bottles is both time and cost-effective compared to typical local materials and techniques, with bottle-based homes boasting the dual benefit of not only being naturally air conditioned, but also being earthquake resistant. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/3b0d0581-aa26-42ae-a045-f7b2536d02ef.jpg","","","","Panama's government incentivizes and awards green initiatives, pursuing a policy that protects the environment and promotes sustainable economic growth.","","","renewed-improved","1804","552ef2b0361618126878404e","58f615b486b7b00ce8946aa8","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-20T10:49:00.000Z","2017-06-20T10:49:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Knowledge  and Power","<p>In a bid to encourage debate in Latin America and the Caribbean on the contribution of creativity as a key element of economic and social development, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) along with local institutions are currently promoting the concept of the “orange economy.“ This involves the creative industry and includes a range of economic activities that are concerned with the generation or development of knowledge and information. According to a report published in 2013, cultural and creative industries (CCI) in western economies generated more than USD175,000 million per year, employing 11 million people.</p><p>If the so-called orange economy were a country, it would be the world's fourth-largest economy, be ranked ninth in terms of exports of goods and services, and represent the world's fourth-largest workforce, research developed by IDB has shown. As a consequence of the developing human capital in Latin America, opportunities to develop the concept of the orange economy are rising in Panama.</p><p>The orange economy includes all the services based on talent, cultural heritage, and creative related products that can be protected applying any kind of intellectual property law. In March 2017, Helga Flores, a specialist on the orange economy at IDB, headed a regional forum entirely focused on the development of cultural and creative industries in Panama and Latin America. BID is currently working to better understand the opportunities that this market offers to more than 107 million people between the ages of 15 and 24; every year, 80,000 people join the orange economy. Intellectual property, advertising and media, cinema, gastronomy, architecture, arts, and cultural-related activities are the sectors that currently underpin the growth of the orange economy in Panama and the Panamanian government is ready to further capitalize on this.</p><p>Unfortunately in Latin America, there are no clear statistics to rely on in order to define an adequate action plan to capitalize on the huge potential offered by the orange economy; countries like Colombia and Costa Rica have promoted specific initiatives such as Cuenta Satélite de la Cultura, a methodology that allows the national accounting departments to process all the economic information related to CCI that might be generated from other economic sectors.</p><p>Data released by the public politics department of MEF noted that public spending on culture per capita stands at USD6.5 in Panama, while the Latin American average is USD19, and that the difficulties facing the sector are cultural entrepreneurship informality, inequality, inadequate funding and investment, and lack infrastructure or cultural spaces, among others. However, MEF is not the only public institution analyzing the latest trends emerging within the Panamanian orange economy: in 2015, Ernst &amp; Young released a regional and global report confirming that the sector generated USD2,250 million—3% of world GDP—and 29.3 million jobs worldwide, of which USD124 million and 1.9 million jobs were generated in Latin America. Research developed by World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and Panama's Ministry of Commerce and Industry has shown that intellectual property generates 6.3% of the national GDP. According to openartspty.com, this economy generates over 50,000 jobs divided among 545 companies operating in the segment, making up 3.2% of the total workforce active in the country.</p><p>In 2016, the film industry alone attracted USD23 million in foreign direct investment, and the sector should be accurately studied and regulated in all its dimensions by the state. However, by and large the industry is still relatively informal and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) along with the Municipality of Panama City are currently working on new proposals, regulations, and activities to promote and to boost the performance of the orange economy; events like jazz festivals, Feria de Artesaní­as, and Festival de Cine are events that are only becoming more successful and relevant in Panama's cultural agenda. Considering the cultural melting pot that lays at the basis of Panama, the young and talented generation that is emerging in Panama the country must capitalize on the huge potential offered by the orange economy. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ORANGE ECONOMY","knowledge-and-power","1557","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-20T10:19:00.000Z","2017-06-20T10:19:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Repairing the Brand","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/04429546-2b77-455c-a45a-841a0458356c.jpg","Repairing the Brand","","","","","<p>Anation's reputation is rather like a left shoe, in that once lost, what is left over will only get you so far. Panama's reputation on the international stage, while not lost as such, certainly took a bruising in 2016, as the Panama Papers revealed 11.5 million examples of a past the country would much rather forget. Meanwhile, public protests have targeted Brazilian constructor Odebrecht, which admitted to internationally bribing its way to public contracts. Protests have also underlined that the economy, though relatively vibrant in and of itself, as we shall see, remains far from equitably distributed, with poverty lingering at a quarter of the small population of around 4 million, albeit down from 40% as recently as 2007.</p><h4>A Welcoming Investment Address</h4><p>The good news is that government and commercial opacity has been taken to task with the prospect of transparent tax and other financial disclosures, with the OECD model of automatic tax information exchange due for implementation in 2018. And while historically subject to abuse, a particular feather in the nation's cap is its lack of bureaucratic obstacles to investment. Panama ranks 70th among 190 economies in the World Bank's 2016 Ease of Doing Business ratings, sliding three places from 2015. The business-friendly economy, managed and regulated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, is party to over 20 free trade agreements. Liberal in nature, there are virtually no currency restrictions in place, and no limits to foreign ownership, or curbs on mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures. Predictably, FDI has been considerable. Official data reveals that in 1Q2015 alone, FDI totaled USD1.7 billion, soaring 32% YoY. Around 65% of FDI derives from reinvested profits, with 22% accounted for by purchases of the shares of Panamanian companies by overseas investors. By 2015 USD11.2 billion of FDI had arrived over the previous three years alone. In 2016 Panama saw the incorporation of 25 new international companies raising the total to 134. By Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MICI) numbers these companies account for FDI of USD800 million and provide employment to 5,000. And according to Felipe Chapman, Partner and Director at INDESA, ""Relative to GDP, FDI is still at about 10% (where the country) also offers all sorts of opportunities in other sectors like tourism, financial services, infrastructure, energy, education, and agriculture.""</p><h4>Selected Metrics</h4><p>At around 80%, the local economy is pre-eminently powered by the services industry, especially banking, commerce, and shipping. Diversity, too, is in evidence not least at the vast Colón Free Trade Zone, while the economy overall is international and dollarized. Being dollarized precludes the financial authorities from resorting to monetary policy, or exchange rate adjustments to determine the trajectory of inflation. Yet it has proven manageable and is forecast at 1.7% by end-2017, and 1.9% at for 2018. Economic activity grew 5.23% in the first two months of 2017, by National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC) data. Leading the rise were commercial trade, transport, storage and communications, industry, construction, electricity and water, hotels, and restaurants. Notably, too, ongoing infrastructure commitments in Colón, in addition to advances on Metro Line 2, had prompted a strong performance from the mining and quarrying construction industry. The wholesale urban redevelopment of Colón featured the construction of 5,000 housing units. The objective was to raise the city of Colón to the level of its internationally renowned free trade zone. Notably, companies resident in the Colon Free Trade Zone contributed USD123.7 million to FDI growth in 1Q2017, marking a YoY rise of 17%. </p><p>In 2016 Central America emerged as the most dynamic sub-region with growth of 3.6%, supported by the Dominican Republic (6.4%) followed by Panama (5.2%). And according to FocusEconomics Panama is set to remain among regional nations with the most rapid economic growth fuelled by infrastructure projects and sizable Panama Canal dividends. That being said, eyes are trained on Washington, where US trade policy has thus far sounded protectionist rhetoric. Trump is no friend of free trade agreements, such as the US-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement signed into law in October 2011 and entering into force in October 2012. The latter nation is a key source of FDI for Panama, while together with China and Chile, is the greatest user of the canal. Trade wobbles, along with modest global economic recovery, could thus impact commerce, and Panama, by extension. Bear in mind here that c.6% of global trade traverses the canal.</p><p>The Panamanian economy grew just 4.5% YoY in Q42016, the poorest since 1Q2014 and notably short of the 5.3% growth of 1Q2016, making for annual growth of 4.9%, the lowest since 2009. 4Q2016 had been bruised by a weaker service sector print of 3.7% growth (Q3: 4.2% YoY), largely resulting from global factors that impacted wholesale trade, tourism, and financial intermediation. By YE2016 GDP per capita was at USD13,300. Signs are good for 2017, however, as in February, Índice Mensual de Actividad Económica (IMAE), the monthly indicator of economic activity, rose to 5.5% from 5% in January, posting a seven-month high. Official data illuminated commerce, transportation, warehousing, and communication, and industry as the best performers. Meanwhile, annual average growth in economic activity climbed from 5% in January close to a two-year high of 5.2% in February. FocusEconomics, as of March 2017, forecasts FY2017 GDP growth of 5.4%, rising to 5.8% in 2018.<br>Panama's economic inequality stems from the telling fact that while agriculture employs close to 40% of the workforce, some 2 million people, its output accounts for less that 3% of GDP. Meanwhile, Panama's unemployment rate remains on the up, in May 2017 registering at 100,000. The 2016 print of 5.8% (2015 5.1%) also marked a rise in labor informality, currently at 40%. Meanwhile, the government forecasts the creation of 42,000 new jobs in 2017 through infrastructure projects, with mining and energy contributing strongly over the coming years. The Ministry of Labor and Labor Development (Mitradel), argues that current unemployment is manageable in so far as the 42,000 jobs earmarked for this year could yet rise to 72,000 with projected mining and the gas sector activity. Gina Montiel is the Manager for Central America, Mexico, Panama, and the Dominican Republic Country Department, and Country Representative in Panama of the Inter-American Development Bank. TBY asked her why a small nation such as Panama suffered from lingering high poverty levels. ""The problem,"" she claimed, ""is not one of using the rent from the Panama Canal, or redistributing taxes; rather, it is that, institutionally, Panama is weak in many sectors, especially the social ones."" Her view is that, ""If we do not develop human capital in these areas, people will not be productive or participate in economic growth.""</p><h4>The Catalytic Canal</h4><p>On April 29, a large rodent named Mickey was filmed waving on the canal, as the Disney Wonder, bearing 2,713 paying mouseketeers, became the first Neo Panamax passenger cruise ship to traverse the widened Panama Canal locks. Last year saw completion of the USD5.7-billion canal expansion, which had spiked public debt to USD17 billion in 2014, and USD20.2 billion in 2015, at 38.7% of GDP. And yet the government has announced plans to reduce the print heavily to just 4% by 2019. The expansion was an inevitable expense given the rising volume of international commerce, and its catalytic effect on regional port and maritime infrastructure will be felt throughout the Caribbean. Panama's exports were dented in 2015 (USD12.8 billion) due to ongoing canal works. Official data for January 2017 shows economic activity growing at its fastest pace within six months, with cargo movements at Panamanian ports up over 12%. As of December 2016, the trade balance/GDP ratio was at a negative 6.5%. Boding well for future periods, once the canal had opened 10 neopanamax services had redirected to it. For the canal's fiscal year, ending September 30, 2016, it had printed income of USD1.93 billion. And while the figure fell short of the official forecast of USD2.010.7 billion, USD1.01 billion nonetheless entered the state coffers. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimate for 2017 is for a contribution of USD1.6 billion.</p><p>Jorge Garcí­a Icaza, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture of Panama in a TBY interview revealed that, ""The expanded canal has increased transit, allowing 168 ships to come through that previously could not."" The ultimate objective is truly ambitious as, ""We want to become the logistics powerhouse of America, and one of the top-five logistics centers in the world. UN logistics data currently ranks Panama 40th in the world and 2nd in the Americas. So there is a long way to go."" Yet Panama is no stranger to meeting targets, whereby, ""We are the most efficient air hub in the Americas, which is why (flag carrier) Copa is a success."" The same heights now need to be scaled by shipping where, ""we need to be the best transshippers in the world,"" he concluded.</p><p>On May 4, Panama experienced an earthquake of 4.4 on the Richter scale. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. Yet in 2017 Panama will continue to recover from the metaphorically seismic events of 2016 that brought unwanted international attention, with the government's response to the fallout being closely observed. Meanwhile, large-scale infrastructure projects are in place that will continue to shoulder domestic economic growth for the mid-term. This should mitigate the prospects of slower recovery in global trade. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/8c233978-2212-4460-8b43-756ea3c37b13.jpg","","","","","","","repairing-the-brand","1672","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784056","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite HSBC selling its holding in Panama to Bancolombia, or what is now known as Banistmo, the UK has maintained a solid and robust level of investment that has been centered around several major investors that continue to operate in the country. One of them is London and Regional Properties, which currently manages Panamá Pacifico.</p><p>GSK could also impose itself as a paradigmatic investor, a successful case study within the pharmaceutical industry. At its factory in Juan Dí­az, GSK produces all the Panadol for Latin America. UK Ambassador Ian Collard commented to TBY: “Panadol is manufactured here in incredibly high-tech facilities. This is not just the case of being strategically located, which of course Panama is; the country has developed a high-tech facility. GSK is a substantial employer in Panama, employing around 300 people in its factory. It has also set up its intellectual headquarters in Panama, and its regional management is located here. This has proven crucial for many other investments that we have seen from the British side.“</p><p>The Colón Free Trade Zone remains an appealing platform that UK investors are capitalizing on to expand their operations on a regional scale. Collard commented: “GSK not only uses Panama as a place of doing business; it also uses it as a place to distribute its goods because of the high-tech facilities available. GSK can get those products that are manufactured here, such as its vaccines, out to the market quickly because of Panama's geographical position.“</p><p>UNILEVER, an international company headquartered in London, has made the most of Panama's logistics platform. The company, the second-largest home consumer goods company in the world after P&amp;G, “employs over 200 staff and has built up a large office in Panama,“ Collard noted. “The country represents a significant part of its business; around USD2.5 billion worth of its global business was conducted from its office in Panama.“</p><p>Another British company that has come to Panama, Solarcentury, considers Panama a regional hub for its operations. Enrique de Ramon, General Director for LatAm at Solar Century, stressed to TBY the importance of the company's operations both in the local and regional market: “We have a wide regional presence, being one of the most influential companies in this sector. Renewables, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV), is a booming, challenging, and competitive sector, with many companies seeking to take advantage of the opportunities.“ Solarcentury built one of the largest solar plants in Panama and in Central America.<br>British investors are currently promoting crucial sectors such as life sciences, education, and transport, with a strong focus on rail and maritime. “Maritime is a huge opportunity because the UK is a historical maritime nation, though Panama is certainly considered the prime maritime nation currently because of its Canal, the two busiest sea ports in Latin America, and the large number of ships—25-26%—carrying the Panamanian flag.“</p><p>Urban planning has become a huge growth driver for the UK, which caught on to the smart cities concept more than a decade ago. In Panama, British companies are putting some of that expertise into use in the context of urban planning. The redevelopment of Colón, a USD600 million investment, will turn the city back into a beautiful jewel on the Caribbean. The master planning was carried out by Atkins, which also did the master planning of Panamá Pacifico and Avenida Central. In addition, Metro Bus, a British transit company that operates buses and trains in the UK, was given a two and half year-concession to work on the bus system here. <br>Education is a priority for Varela's government and the UK's involvement in the Instituto Técnico Superior Especializado (ITSE) project reconfirms how the UK fosters and encourages the development of this crucial sector: “We helped to design the roadmap of ITSE and are now doing a marketing program. We have worked with the government to develop new curricula.“ </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","UK investors in Panama","british-interests","1665","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a country of less than 4 million people, roughly the equivalent of metropolitan Seattle, events emanating from Panama have had the ability to rattle governments everywhere from Russia, the UK, Iceland, Malta, Greece, Spain, Ukraine, China, and Azerbaijan, among many others. Though the notorious Panama Papers first broke in 2015, a case was still being heard by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in May 2017 to determine whether Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should be stripped of his powers over two of his children's ties to the Panamanian law firm and financial services provider, Mossack Fonseca, the chief architect of the offshore tax evasion services that have become synonymous with the country.</p><p>While the papers have certainly dented the country's reputation and struck a powerful chord of protest against the role the Central American nation plays in the global offshoring of financial assets, the scandal also reveals the extent to which the country is so firmly embedded in the global economy—for good, bad, right, or wrong—that the ebb and flow of its very existence seems to happen in sync with the global movement of capital, goods, and people. As the Vice President of Panama Isabel Saint Malo put it, “Panama has been globalized before globalization was in fashion.""</p><p>Now that it looks as though the trend is pulling in the other direction, in rhetoric if not yet in action, Panama's position becomes somewhat more precarious—at least on the surface of things. A world turning away from international trade, financial secrecy, and the export-expropriation of surplus wealth to offshore accounts, Panama stands to lose from a world turning in upon itself, especially given its huge investment in expanding the Panama Canal, the new and improved girth of which is fully 50% bigger and opened to great fanfare and equally great expectations in June 2016.</p><p>That being said, as long as errant assets need a place to rest their tired eyes and governments fail to muster the political capital to combat them, offshore havens will have a home in the world. The trick, as ever, will be to toe the line between mollifying the malefactors and their pursuant governments and international organizations with equal initiative. In the wake of the papers, how does Panama hope to achieve this? For one, notes Vice President Malo, since the leaking of the papers (which somewhat unjustly associate the nature of the leak with Panama when fully 80% of the offshoring firms outed in the leaked documents were registered elsewhere, among them the US and British Virgin Islands) the country has aggressively moved to clean up its legal act.</p><p>For starters, the country has made massive strides to get on board with major financial regulators. Five years ago, Panama had not signed a single double taxation agreement; today it has 25. What's more, as recently as 2014 Panama was on the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering's (FAFT) gray list for failing to comply with international anti-money laundering standards.</p><p>Founded at the 1989 G7 summit in Paris, this intergovernmental organization headquartered at the OECD now has 37 members and is tasked not only with tracing and combating money laundering, but in the wake of 9/11, terror financing. As such, when Panama introduced anti-money laundering legislation and legislation to prevent terror-related funds from passing through the Panamanian financial system, it was finally removed from the FATF's gray list in February 2016. As part and parcel of these efforts, the country has also advanced to phase two of the OECD's peer review.</p><h4>The hand that giveth…</h4><p>Having moved to shore up relations with the OECD and FAFT, the biggest question is how Panama can reassure its powerful northern neighbor that it is committed to greater transparency and fiduciary reform. After all, one of the earliest surprises in the Panama Papers story was how few Americans were implicated in the mass leak: this either meant that they were built of stronger moral fiber, or they had other means of sheltering their assets. What is striking, in any case, is that the papers emerged several years after the massive US Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA), a widely debated and controversial free trade agreement that went into effect in 2012 and “provides [the] elimination of tariffs and removes barriers to US services, including financial services,"" in the words of the office of the US trade representative. <br>If Panama had carried out the necessary reforms to assuage the US State Department's concerns in the run up to the ratification of TPA, how did this diluvial leak manage to take down practically every BRIC and shake much of the world's financial mortar without a peep from Uncle Sam? For starters, the nature of the financial architecture at work is far bigger than a single bilateral relationship. As Global Financial Integrity recently reported, some USD7.8 trillion was siphoned out of developing and middle-income countries between 2004 and 2013 alone, much of which finds its way to the Caribbean in one form or another to first be laundered. A rational calculation leaves but two options: get in on the action or take a naked swipe at the diamond piñata with the regulatory slugger.</p><p>Though far from the days of Operation Just Cause (to oust the drug-running CIA asset Manuel Noriega, now deceased), the US' role in shoring up or shaking down Panamanian factions remains a powerful one. After leaving office in 2014, former Panamanian president Ricardo Martinelli allegedly took up residence in Miami, where he is still thought to reside. Now wanted by the Panamanian Supreme Court on 10 separate criminal accounts, one of which includes using state funds to spy on more than 150 political opponents, Panama's Foreign Ministry recently filed an extradition request with the US State Department to have him returned to stand trial. The US, while acknowledging its extradition treaty with Panama dating to the 1900s, has yet to reveal whether or not it will grant the request.</p><h4>A fine balance with Beijing</h4><p>Whatever the fallout from these two corruption scandals, both of which have taken their internal and external tolls, Panama still saunters forward in world affairs, albeit with a few hickups. For one, Panama had managed to balance a particularly tricky act between maintaining its historical ties with Taiwan without antagonizing China. Angered by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's call with the American president, the Chinese have been pressing Taiwan's (mostly Latin American) allies to sever ties to the semi-breakaway island, which has long enjoyed diplomatic recognition in the area since the end of the Chinese civil war. This is a tactic China has not pursued without success: since the early 1990s, fully one-third of Taiwan's allies have broken off ties with Chiang Kai-Shek's political descendants, reducing its sovereign allies to 21. That became 20 in June, when Panama adopted the ""One China"" policy, severing ties with Taiwan.</p><p>Before June, Panama had remained firm in its neutrality. After all, after the opening of the USD5.4 billion canal expansion last July, the first ship to pass through it was a Chinese freighter, brimming with roughly 9,500 metal cargo containers, the vessel Cosco Shipping Panama. A decade in the making, the expansion allows for ships bearing up to 13,000 cargo containers to pass through the 80km canal, a huge increase on the 5,500-capacity vessels that have been the largest to make their way through the canal since its original 1914 iteration. A remarkable feat of engineering, the expanded canal is in many ways a new wonder of the modern world: using enough steel to erect 29 Eiffel Towers, the new locks are 22m wider (55m compared to 33m) and 6m deeper (18m compared to 12m).</p><p>Though the expansion will undoubtedly enhance China's trade with the Atlantic world, it comes at a small price to the former's prestige. After all, it was an independent Chinese billionaire, Wang Jing, reputed by some to have the tacit backing of the Chinese state, who was going to build an even bigger and better canal across Nicaragua at far greater expense. Though that project has now floundered, saving huge tracts of rainforest and fragile ecosystems in the process, Beijing's stake in the region has scarcely faltered. For starters, and somewhat ironically, part of the boost in demand for larger cargo capacity comes from US crude from the Gulf Coast now making its way in greater volumes to China and Japan to feed Chinese growth and increased Japanese demand after the Fukushima incident.</p><p>With the US-China already the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world and only growing, the Boston Consulting Group now predicts that fully 10% of all East Asian container traffic bound for the East Coast of the US may soon pass through the extended canal, rather than unload on the Pacific coast and be schlepped across the continent by truck or train. Though seemingly marginal, this figure represents a huge chunk of global commerce, and will make Panama the literal linchpin for the world's most important commercial and geopolitical relationship—not to mention the increased importance of the Central American nation to US-Japanese, US-Vietnamese, and US-ASEAN trade more generally. And the excitement is mutual: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has already announced a new USD1.3 billion project to raise the 85-year old Bayonne Bridge to accommodate the vessels, while the city of Charleston, South Carolina has begun plans to deepen its harbor from 13.7m to 16m by the decade's end in order to accommodate vessels from East Asia.</p><h4>Back to basics</h4><p>Back at home, worldwide interest in the canal's expansion seems likely to offset the fallout from the papers: already with the highest rate of growth in Latin America in the 21st century, the IMF expects Panama to grow by 6% in 2017. According to the deputy vice minister of the economy, Iván Zarak, FDI in Panama has tripled since 2009, and perhaps most crucially, no single sector of the economy accounts for more than one-fifth of total output. The country continues to pursue more traditional staples of 21st century diplomacy, robustly supporting international dialog and development agendas every chance it gets. In 2015 it hosted the 7th Summit of the Americas, the first of its kind to host Cuba—and during which Raul Castro famously met with Barack Obama—in addition to the country's recent election to the UN Commission of Human Rights. A Panamanian also finally sits on the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights for the first time in the country's history. Clearly, the long-term trends are good for Panama: close ties to America and China are all but certain, and provided East and West are still keen on each other's products and greenbacks, the isthmus-nation's place in the sun seems secure. Less clear is how reliant it needs to remain on opaque and morally dubious financial dealings when everything else seems to be going its way. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/62db9510-5b0d-4ce9-b0f9-a1493d7e4e49.jpg","","","","Although Panama's place in the sun is all but guaranteed by the extension of the canal, the isthmus nation will still have to toe a fine line in assuaging the world over the transparency of its financial dealings.Happily, it seems to be making significant progress.","","","a-huge-foot-in-both-worlds","1542","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784055","Latin America & Caribbean > Panama","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is possible for foreign businesspeople to set up their business through a properly licensed Kuwaiti agent. According to PwC, a six-month wait can be expected for businesses after a license is granted until incorporation. While LLCs require at least two Kuwaitis be shareholders, joint stock companies must have no less than five. Unless the business is located in a free trade zone, foreigners are allowed to own no more than 49% of share capital. As of 2015, PwC reported that the government was no longer issuing licenses for the establishment of an entity in Kuwait's FTZ.</p><h4>Foreign Direct Investment</h4><p>Toward the end of 2014, a new law on investment was enacted, with further new regulations expected to be introduced in the future, according to PwC. The law created the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA), which is in charge of administering investments in the country. With the enactment of the new law, foreign investors are allowed full ownership of subsidiaries, branches, or representative offices in the country, and have the potential to receive benefits such as 10-year tax exemption if the company meets certain requirements, and exemptions from customs duties. There are, however, certain requirements to be met in order to receive such advantages. These benefits include the company's contributions to Kuwaiti employment and advancement of national technology, and are limited to certain types of businesses; eligible business must also be able to prove their activity will benefit the economy in several ways.</p><h4>Taxation</h4><p>Kuwait will only tax Kuwait-sourced income. Though different from other residence models of taxation, certain activities that may elsewhere not be considered taxable may be liable in Kuwait. There is a flat, 15% income tax, down considerably from 55%, which ended nearly a decade ago. Taxes are normally calculated based on profits noted in audited financial statements. Foreign businesses working in Kuwait are subject to income tax, and there is a rather broad definition of doing business in the country—a foreign company may be subject to tax with as little as an agent working in Kuwait. Capital gains made upon selling an asset are considered a business profit and are thus unconsidered for capital gains taxes; there are also no withholding taxes. All business—both foreign and Kuwaiti—must hold 5% of every payment to a contractor, as well as all final payments until the Ministry of Finance has received a tax clearance certificate.<br>Business etiquette<br></p><p>While Arabic is the official language, English is widely spoken and near compulsory in business. However, despite most negotiation and in-person interactions being done in English, contracts and official documents are often written in Arabic. As is common in the region, Kuwaitis prefer to do business with people they know, so introductions and general getting to know one another may extend for some time before getting down to business. Being restricted to a six-hour workday, it is wise to plan meetings with government officials in the morning. Keep in mind any meeting may be interrupted by prayer times. Many companies are family owned and thus take a hierarchical decision-making structure, with many decisions being made at the top. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOING BUSINESS","the-time-is-now","1826","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784061","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public officials and private industry are coming to see tourism as a potentially lucrative area of investment and activity, and they are reorienting accordingly. As this reorientation translates more and more into tangible investment and strategic commitment, Kuwait's rich cultural heritage and commitment to experiential excellence all but assure impressive growth in the industry.</p><p>According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), Kuwait is attracting record numbers of visitors from across the region and globe, stimulating economic activity and prompting further development in the sector. The tourism sector's direct contribution to the economy has been increasing in recent years, and in 2015 the sector contributed 2.1% to GDP (roughly KWD781.9 million), and in 2016 that figure grew by an additional 6.7%, directly contributing nearly 2.25% to GDP. The industry is forecast to grow by 5% a year for the next decade, with direct contribution approaching 2.6% of GDP (roughly KWD1.4 billion) by 2026. Total contribution to the Kuwaiti economy already sits at comparable levels, and in 2015 the sector was estimated to have contributed 4.9% (KWD1.769 billion) to GDP, and in 2016 the fiscal contribution increased by 5.6%. Total contribution is also expected to rise steadily over the next 10 years, and forecasts from the WTTC put growth at around 5% a year, bringing total contribution to GDP to 5.9% by 2026. </p><p>The sector is also an important source of employment in Kuwait, directly providing nearly 54,500 jobs in 2015 (2% of employment). With strong growth across many sub-sectors, employment is expected to rise by 5.4% in 2016 and continue marching upwards by an estimated 2.4% per year for the next 10 years, reaching 73,000 direct jobs, or 2.3% of total employment, by 2026, according to the WTTC. The sector's total contribution to employment is substantially larger, and the industry employed nearly 4.5%, nearly 121,000 jobs, of the country's total employment in 2015. These figures are expected to reach 126,500 by the end of 2016 and grow an additional 2.8% a year for the next decade, reaching 167,000 jobs. </p><p>To stimulate growth and keep it on track to achieving these robust growth forecasts, Kuwait has been investing and encouraging investment in its tourism industry. In 2015, investment totaled KWD124.6 million, accounting for nearly 1.5% of the country's total investment for that year. Investment is expected to grow by an impressive 10.8% in 2016, and increase by a steady 3.7% a year for the next 10 years.</p><p>The majority of Kuwait's tourism activity is generated by domestic leisure travel, with 80.7% (KWD1.15 billion) of travel and tourism composed of leisure spending and domestic spending accounting for 84.7% of all spending in the sector. Leisure spending is expected to finish out 2016 with steady growth, and forecasts from the WTTC estimate a positive rate of nearly 8.7%, bringing total leisure spending to nearly KWD1.25 billion. Region and global economic headwinds are expected to deflate business spending somewhat, and spending is expected to fall in 2016, recording a negative growth rate of 2.4%. However, in the mid term both business and leisure spending are expected to perform well, and per annum growth rates for the leisure segment is expected to top 4.5% while the rate for the business segment is forecast to be 6.5%.</p><p>A core component of the plan to stimulate growth is the project aimed at developing the islands of Boubyan, Failaka, Warba, Miskan, and Awha. The vision is to see these islands transformed into economic and tourist hubs for the country and the region, according to the Kuwait Times. Thus far, the plans being discussed by the government call for turning three of the islands into free zones, thereby bringing international business operations to the area. Additionally, once complete, the islands are expected to bring nearly 5 million tourists to the country a year and generate nearly 40,000 tourism-related jobs, according to the government. With more than 10.2 million travelers passing through Kuwait International Airport in 2015, the country has the tourist volume necessary to make the island developments very compelling.</p><p>Kuwait is also trying to establish itself as a center for medical tourism in the region, and efforts are being made to attract investment and development. Private firms and service providers are expected to begin offering expanded services across Kuwait, a move that is expected to not only reduced the outflow of medical tourists but spur sizable growth in the number of inbound patients. Ambitious plans to overhaul the Kuwaiti healthcare system, including hospital and health center construction, have the potential to draw even more medical tourists, according to the Medical Tourism Index. The Kuwait Medical Tourism Exhibition is a key venue focused on catalyzing investment in the sub-sector, and the annual event draws investors and companies from across the region.</p><p>The government is trying to boost the level of international travelers coming to Kuwait. To this end, a MoA was recently signed between Kuwait and the Sultanate of Brunei, which, among other things, aims to stimulate international travel and tourism between the two countries. Private initiatives and public plans are vital means of generating new channels of activity within the tourism sector, and the Kuwaiti government is looking to participate in this process in new and creative ways. </p><p>In an effort to draw more tourists, Kuwait is trying to leverage its rich cultural and artistic heritage. With one of the most long-lived and unique aesthetic traditions in the region, Kuwait's cultural heritage is a rich source of interest for travelers within the country and across the region. One of the groups spearheading this effort is the National Council for Culture, Arts and Literature (NCCAL), and it hopes to not only enrich and expand the country's artistic output, but to draw an international and regional audience to the country so it can be appreciated on a grander scale. To draw visitors, the council organizes a vast array of activities and festivals, of which the Qurain Festival, the annual BookFair, the Children's Cultural Festival, and the international music festival are the most well known and popular. Another key tourist draw that focuses on the cultural and artistic traditions of Kuwait is the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre and the surrounding cultural district. The complex is set to include world-class theaters, concert halls, cinemas and opera house, and a library archive. The complex is expected to draw artists and visitors from across MENA and the world, and Kuwaiti stakeholders are excited by the possibilities the new space holds. By creating a state-of-the-art institution dedicated to the development of the arts, Kuwait has signaled its intent to both draw tourists from every corner of globe and create a unique space within the region for the expression of creativity and imagination.</p><p>A number of new projects have come online in recent months, and, despite some economic uncertainties, private firms are investing even more in the tourism space. The Crowne Plaza, a 211-room luxury hotel completed by the InterContinental Hotels Group, is one such project, and developers in the industry are confident that investment in Kuwait will pay sizable dividends in the future. Demand for luxury accommodations is already outstripping supply, and hotel operators see this area as a potentially lucrative one. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Antoine Flouty, Area General Manager of InterContinental Hotels Group, explained how luxury-oriented business and leisure could be developed simultaneously and synergistically. “In terms of hotels, demand can be very high, so the supply in terms of rooms for four- and five-star hotels cannot handle the load of tourists coming from Saudi Arabia,“ said Flouty. “Therefore more projects will provide sustainability as visitors could spend the weekdays on business and then the weekends on leisure.“</p><p>Developers who recognize the needs and potential of the Kuwaiti market are able to develop holistic plans that meet the demands of both the business and leisure-oriented traveler, creating viable, growing businesses for the tourism industry. Government spending plans aimed at public works projects and infrastructure are also likely to spur even more activity in business and leisure related travel. Other luxury projects set to open in the near future are the Mercure Kuwait, planned to open in 2017, the Hilton Olympia Kuwait, set for 2019, and the Grand Hyatt, set for 2020, according to Forbes Middle East. Nor, however, are the developments strictly luxury oriented. Middle-tier firms that offer more affordable accommodations are also in the works, and developers believe these facilities will attract more budget-conscious travelers who might otherwise be dissuaded from traveling by the high sticker price of some of the more opulent hotels.

The country's Integrated Education Reform Program seeks to reimagine the way Kuwait approaches education, creating an environment that consistently produces students capable of entering the new global workforce.</p><p>In line with the country's vast ambitions, the government has dedicated a huge percentage of its resources to education. According to the Central Bank of Kuwait, the government's annual expenditure on education grew at 14.8% a year between 2010 and 2014, approaching USD9 billion in 2014, a figure that represents 16.2% of the government's total spending. Steady progress has been made in the country's literacy rate over the last 10 years, and the most recently available statistics put the national rate at 94.7% for women and 96.71% for men.<br>With basic education lasting 14 years and broken into four distinct levels—kindergarten (two years), primary (five years), intermediate (four years), and secondary (three years)—Kuwaiti schoolchildren are subject to an intensive schooling program. According to the Central Statistical Bureau of Kuwait, there were 606 primary and secondary schools educating nearly 376,000 students in the 2015/2016 school year. The sector boasts almost 65,000 teachers, of which almost 25,000 are foreign nationals. The net enrollment rate for Kuwaiti students in primary education has remained fairly stable over the last five years, and in the 2015/2016 school year it sat at 96.4%. Similarly, the net enrollment rate for Kuwaitis in intermediate education was 96.1% and secondary education was 86.6%.</p><p>According to the 2016/2017 Global Competitiveness Index, Kuwait has improved in a number of key areas. It ranked 103rd in quality of primary education, 88th in primary education enrollment rate, 68th in secondary education enrollment rate, 90th in tertiary education enrollment rate, 86th in quality of education system, 105th in quality of math and science education, 92nd in quality of management schools, 91st in internet access in schools, 113th in local availability of specialized training services, and 80th in staff training. Each of these areas has been the recipient of sizable levels of investment in recent years, and the Kuwait government is dedicated to ensuring that tangible progress continues to be made in every category. Despite these efforts, however, certain budgetary pressures have kept the sector from achieving all of its goals.</p><p>In order to improve its outcomes and ensure that is working as effectively as it can, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education has partnered with the World Bank to create a comprehensive plan of action. The plan establishes clear steps for improving the Kuwaiti education system in a number of core areas. According to the Arab Times, the World Bank and the Ministry of Education have identified a host of obstacles that had been impeding the proper implementation of the Kuwaiti reforms, and the government is working to ensure areas like teacher training and student assessment are improved.</p><p>As education has come more and more to the fore, there has been a renewed emphasis on alternative methods and private schools. There has been a surge in the number of international schools operating across the GCC, and Kuwait has also seen a sizable increase in the quantity of these institutions. In an exclusive interview with TBY, David Botbyl, Superintendent of the American International School, described some of the difficulties schools like his are facing in the newly competitive environment, noting that the abundance of schools and dearth of teachers has made hiring difficult. “It becomes quite competitive at times,“ said Botbyl. “With tuition increases stagnant in Kuwait, the outlook in attracting highly effective teachers is challenging.“ Despite this competition for the best staff, however, Botbyl stressed that the main focus is quality education. “There are competitors, but we also have the same goals and objectives, and we have to keep working closely together to achieve our common goals to do better for the kids and better for the country.“ In an exclusive interview with TBY, Russel Byrne, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Education Consortium, echoed the assessment that the Kuwaiti private education sector is more fiercely competitive than ever before. “A lot of new education businesses are coming up,“ said Byrne. “I love the competition, as it will make the market stronger.“</p><p>At the tertiary level, Kuwait University is the only public university in the country, though plans are in the pipeline for establishing another university, the Jaber al-Ahmed University. In the 2015/2016 school year, there were nearly 38,000 students enrolled at Kuwait University, of which almost three-quarters were women. There are a total of nine private universities in Kuwait with a combined enrollment of 25,542 students, according to National Bureau of Statistics. While enrollment rates for tertiary education lag behind other countries in region, new curricula aimed at instilling real-world knowledge are expected to draw more students into universities.</p><p>Many universities across Kuwait have developed a dual-emphasis curriculum that focuses on both a practical education, thereby preparing students to enter the workforce, and a rigorous theoretical training, allowing them to reshape and contribute in significant ways to their chosen fields. Institutions of higher education are focused on producing real value for their students, and they have crafted an environment that can allow the newest generation of Kuwaitis to prosper in the 21st century global economy. In an exclusive interview with TBY, Prof. Nizar Hamzeh, President of the American University of Kuwait, described the four levels of collaboration between the university and the private sector: business incubators for students, internships and practical training programs, business sponsorship for student programs, and consultancy. This robust industry-oriented preparation allows students to effectively transfer their knowledge into the workplace, creating value that has far-reaching social and economic implications. </p><p>In fact, this focus on long-term value creation does not begin only in university. Kuwait students are encouraged from as early as secondary school to consider the ways they might change and contribute to the social and commercial landscape of their country and region. Russel Byrne, Co-founder &amp; CEO of the Education Consortium, has made it a mission of his organization to offer free entrepreneurship courses to all students in grades 9,10, 11, and 12. “The truth is the most students today have an entrepreneurialism about them,“ said Byrne. “Our role is to empower these chosen few to become successful, fully-fledged entrepreneurs.“ As public and private schools and universities continue to make strides in developing the education landscape of Kuwait, hopes are high that the country will become a regional leader in the near future. With passionate contributions coming from many different stakeholders, the system is expected improve greatly in coming years. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Education","expanding-the-horizons","1432","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total investment of USD775 million was allocated by the Diwan Al-Amiri to reshape the cultural district of the city.</p><p>The center envisions offering a broad variety of cultural outlets, providing a space for performing arts and music, but also houses a library alongside a place dedicated to historical documents. In the midst of a spacious parkland setting, the center also offers a variety of leisure activities and a restaurant district. In close proximity to the Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre, the city now has two premises to build a new and modern cultural domain. The JACC was constructed over an area of 52,000sqm.</p><p>As the center is under the auspices of HH Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, he welcomed and celebrated the opening of the center. The ceremony leveraged Kuwait's cultural heritage of theater in a modern, avant-garde, and experimental tradition, and had as special guest the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.</p><p>Thus far, the JACC has had a line-up of both Kuwaiti and global performers, with the musical Cats as one of its flagship shows. As the Amir is vocal about youth empowerment, the JACC also provides a space for dialog and workshops on public speaking, giving the Kuwaiti youth a forum to speak. As more than a place for entertainment, the Amir wants the JACC to be a platform for educational and cultural exchange—a powerhouse for culture. In this regard, the venue fits in the New Kuwait Program, the latest strategic plan and outline for the future of Kuwait. The plan aims to lift Kuwait in international standards across the board, leveraging on a strong diversification program and empowering the youth. Opening up to the world and making the country more attractive as a tourist destination is part of that plan as well, having a world-class cultural center that is internationally appraised fits the plan nicely.</p><p>The flagship hall is the National Theatre, designed for large stage productions like opera, musicals, ballet, and dance, as well as the possibility of holding a large conference in style—with a seating capacity of 2,000. The Drama Theatre and Studio Theatre are smaller, intimate spaces, which, in addition to the performing arts, tailor to promenade events. The other signature space is the National Concert Hall, a traditional shoebox-shaped music center to accommodate all types of orchestras, bands, and ensembles. Other spaces include a recital hall, a multipurpose hall for conferences, a symposium, and cinema with a capacity of more than 1,000.<br>The center was designed by SSH Design, a Kuwaiti architectural firm with a broad presence in the MENA region. Chairman Omran Hayat said of the project: “We have large experience with cultural projects, but the delivery of JACC has certainly propelled us to a great international reputation in this segment of the market."" Kuwait remains SSH's primary market, with Oman its second base, but over the past years it has worked in Dubai, Bahrain, and Qatar as well, whilst aiming for entry into Saudi Arabia. SSH delivered the JACC in 22 months.<br>With JACC, Kuwait aims to continue its legacy of the GCC's custodian of arts and culture, and to take a leading role in bringing cultural events and an appreciation of the arts to the masses. In the words of prominent media figure and former Minister of Information, Mohammad Al-Sanousi: “JACC will be a shining beacon of cultural renaissance and usher a new era of artistic movements."" </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","The Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Centre is poised to cash in on the country's rich cultural history by offering a space for a wide range of the arts.","","Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Centre","a-bit-of-shine","1640","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405f","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, like its GCC counterparts its export revenues from oil and gas allow for a system of trade-based food production. The reason for this is self-explanatory; the climate is not overly conducive to farming, with long, dry, and hot summers with temperatures of over 45 degrees centigrade, with frequent sandstorms. The rainy season is from October to May, and in that period the annual rainfall is less than 300mm across an area of 100sqkm. To put that in perspective, across 100km for a whole year, it receives little more than a tall glass of water. The lack of water means that agriculture has seen minimal development and the country is heavily reliant on food imports. </p><p>With no permanent rivers of lakes, groundwater is Kuwait's only natural water resource. In a report by World Resources Institute in 2015, Kuwait was placed among the top nine countries facing “an extremely high water risk“ by 2040. Kuwait relies on an inflow of about 20 million cbm per annum in lateral underflow from Saudi Arabia. As it stands, there is no charge for the use of groundwater supplies, which has led to wasteful practices in agriculture, which is responsible for 54% of its usage, and misuse of this high-quality water by the sector has only hampered the development of an agriculture industry. Almost all of Kuwait's cultivated area relies on artificial irrigation. </p><p>Kuwait's landscape is relatively flat, with slightly undulating desert plains sloping gently toward the northeast. The desert is punctuated by a few oases. Various reports over the years have calculated the acreage of potentially cultivatable land. Today, it is judged at around 150,000ha, which is an area a little smaller than the total area of Finland's autonomous í…land Islands. Estimates about areas that can sustain crops constitute between 25,000 and 37,500ha, which is an area the size of the Maldives. A decade ago, the number of productive farms in this area was 1,373, but they are unable to make more than a small dent in Kuwait's food import bill. This prospect is also hampered by the fact that arable land is shrinking at a rate of 1% per annum. </p><p>Livestock production is the most important component of agriculture, contributing the biggest percentage of agricultural GDP (67%), while plant production makes up around 23%. There is some activity in the fishing industry that makes up the remaining 10%, but it serves minimal domestic demand. </p><p>Much of the fishing for the local market was done by small boats, like the native dhow. Local waters are home to meid, mullet, and cultured European sea bream. The more commercial level of fishing was confined to the United Fisheries of Kuwait, which operates a fleet of vessels that ventures into the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Atlantic for its hauls. The attractiveness of the industry has been hampered by reports of over-fishing in the 1970s, which led to considerable drops in numbers that was not helped by decades of more oil spills and environmental damage to Kuwaiti waters, making it a highly stressed body of water that is often the scene of massive fish kills. </p><p>Historically the authority supported efforts to increase vegetable production through hydrophonics. In 1989, Kuwait produced 40,000 tons of tomatoes, 25,000 tons of onions, 7,000 tons of melons, and 1,000 tons of dates. Today, however, the idea of growing plants in Kuwait, given the expenses involved, is ultimately counterproductive. </p><p>Another initiative that has made inroads in ambition of achieving long-term agricultural sustainability is the Arid Land Agriculture Production Program (AAP), which is run by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research, established in 1967 to address key challenges facing the nation through research and development. The AAP has been working to develop techniques that bolster local practices, such as soilless production techniques that save and recycle 90% of the water. The organization is also working with the Kuwait Livestock Transport and Trading Company to enhance productivity. Together, the two have managed to bring down the mortality of their dairy cows from 44% to 5%, and of young calves from 9% to 1%. </p><p>Very few expect or could even imagine Kuwait becoming self-sufficient in its food production. However, it is important that the country has a food industry for the sake of its overall food securing. Already, investments are being made in building and maintaining a food industry capable of ensuring a reliable and high-quality food supply for the population. </p><p>Part of this ambition is to enter the value addition chain. The EU, for example, makes millions of euros from exporting processed food products to Kuwait, far more than it does by exporting raw materials. For example, it exported EUR55 million worth of pasta, pastry, biscuits, and bread to Kuwait in 2015, but did not export a cent's worth of wheat. The total value of prepared food products that were exported from the EU to Kuwait in 2015 was EUR237 million. </p><p>The idea of bringing food production processes to Kuwait was previously shot down by the fact that in order to process food you need temperature-controlled environments and plenty of water. Kuwait imports over 96% of its food, and more often than not in its final form. Government spending is expected to exceed oil revenue in 2017, and the importance of economic diversification is being pressed ever more firmly by the low oil price environment. </p><p>There is also the added issue of potential supply disruption to add into the mix. Kuwait's geographic location, bordering Iraq and in close proximity to Iran, introduces geopolitical considerations into the food supply chain. For example, in the past Iran has threatened to close vital trade routes in the Arabian Gulf, potentially hampering the delivery of food imports. For example, improving food storage facilities could go some way to mitigating the threat of supply disruptions and would enable local industry to better capture domestic production. </p><p>In May 2015, Kuwait announced a plan for food self-sufficiency by 2040. Although some have deemed this ambition unfeasible, there are some pockets of production, such as poultry, which could become self-sufficient if properly managed. </p><p>Some local entrepreneurs and businesses are today exploring and even investing in in-country food production, using raw materials from Europe, for example, both adding value in Kuwait and reducing the import bill. In an attempt to enhance food security, it is steadily increasing the domestic production of some food items, such as poultry, eggs, fruit, and vegetables. But the lack of water places considerable limitations on any expansion, meaning that a more cost-effective and realistic approach is needed. </p><p>The appetite of Kuwait is great. Growing levels of food consumption means that approximately 90% of Kuwaitis are reportedly overweight, and 58% say that they prepare more food than they require. In recent years, the government has invested in media campaigns to raise awareness about food and water consumption in an attempt to change attitudes, in particular to water conservation. </p><p>Looking to the future, Kuwait's Livestock Transport and Trading Company (KLTT) is ambitious in its plans for self-sufficiency. The company transports livestock from around the world to the Gulf, slaughtering in country to ensure that the meat satisfies halal standards. It takes a fortnight to transport livestock from Australia, and imports over 700,000 head of sheep per year. </p><p>In an interview with TBY, CEO Osama Khaled Boodai explained how the company is now raising 3,000 Neami ewes, a local breed, and intends to cultivate a flock of 50,000 ewes by 2027. There is a lot of technical requirements to keep such a flock alive. Boodai recounted how the company sources water from the government, the only source of water: “We have to maintain the water at a certain temperature, as the animals cannot drink hot water. We put a piping system for them deep in the ground so that it cools the water as it moves down and use chillers whenever needed.“ The end goal is to be self-sufficient in sheep production. “The livestock quantities in Australia are, in fact, reducing, as there used to be 180 million heads as a flock in 2000, while today there are only 90 million; a 50% reduction. So, if they continue with the current production levels throughout the next 10 years, we might find that there are only 40 million.“ </p><p>It is projects like this that will be most welcome in the Kuwaiti market. Projects that champion self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on imports, particularly of processed goods will have the largest effect on the import bill and help guarantee food security as well as jobs for Kuwaitis for generations to come. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/aabedd15-cc9d-494f-ae84-1365545343f2.jpg","","","","","","","fuel-and-food","3427","552ef2b0361618126878404e","56cc3fca86b7b014bccb1aff","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also reflected in decisions made by his senior economic advisor, HE Yousif El-Ebraheem, the reputed educationalist and academic who served a distinguished career in public service. Amongst other appointments, he was Minister of Education &amp; Higher Education, Finance, and Planning.</p><p>Since the start of the decade, several projects have been launched to empower the youth and encourage them to pursue careers outside of the public domain. A notable example of this was the National Fund for Small and Medium Enterprises, which was founded in 2013 and is now accountable for a publicly allocated KWD2 billion. In addition to funding, the organization provides seminars and consultations for aspiring entrepreneurs.<br>The fund was one of several recommendations that followed a comprehensive research project that was a part of the National Youth Project, which brought together 45 young Kuwaitis and gave them one year to work out their vision of the future for Kuwait. In a grand ceremony, their ideas were presented to His Highness the Amir and members of the cabinet. Another recommendation was to establish a Ministry of Youth Affairs, which was materialized in 2012 and is now set to grow even bigger, creating a a new Ministry for Sports. Many of the 45 young Kuwaitis that participated have either moved on to work in these new governmental institutions or joined the ranks of the Supreme Council of Planning and Development, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, or the Supreme Petroleum Council.</p><p>Kuwait has been progressive about taking a leading role for empowerment of the Arab youth since 2009, holding its first bi-annual summit for just this purpose. In order to further promote this idea, an Arab fund for SME development was founded with total capital reaching USD2 billion, of which USD500 million came from Kuwait, USD500 million from Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the Arab world contributing varying amounts.<br>The Ministry of Higher Education, led by HE Dr. Mohammad Abdulatif Mohammad Al-Fares, is currently guided by the latest five-year plan, primarily targeted at lifting standards across the board and aligning graduate programs to industry demands, bridging the gap between academia and the labor market. With the country in dire need of more graduates in the sciences, the Sabah Al-Ahmad Center for Creativity was established in 2010 as part of the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS); the center is aimed at boosting interest among young Kuwaitis for professions in science and encouraging them to commercialize their discoveries at a later stage in life.</p><p>The major challenge surrounding empowering the youth is no longer employing everyone in public-sector positions, especially considering the government's general strategy now is to have an active private sector responsible for the lion's share of GDP development. Youth employment remains a major concern, and the primary challenge is creating value-adding jobs for young Kuwaitis. The country has both public and private education institutes, all of which are increasingly becoming aware of this new reality, one where it matters what degree you receive for the career you want to pursue. Young Kuwaitis are increasingly encouraged to join private firms or start their own companies. For the latter, there is a difference between opening a new restaurant, which requires bringing in 10-15 foreign laborers, and creating an IT services company for two highly skilled Kuwaitis. The first will not have much of an impact on youth employment or GDP generation, though these industries can flourish on their own if there is enough demand; however export- and service-oriented activities will significantly boost the economic landscape of the country. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","With the private sector poised to take on a greater role in the Kuwaiti economy, the country is working to instill a sense of ambition and entrepreneurship in its youth to steer it away from careers in public service.","","Youth empowerment","power-to-the-young-people","1537","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Having established separate healthcare schemes for Kuwaitis and expats, the government is looking to overcome the challenges currently faced by the country's public health segment. In light of this, the Kuwait Health Assurance Hospitals Company (Dhaman) was established to provide healthcare facilities and insurance services for Kuwait's expat population of more than 2 million people. Initiated as a public-private partnership (PPP) with a paid-up capital of up to KWD230 million, Dhaman's shares are 24% government-owned and 26% private. As the remaining shares will be publicly listed, Dhaman's IPO is expected to be the biggest in Kuwait's history.</p><p>This comes as no surprise given the sheer magnitude of Dhaman's operations in terms of healthcare facility construction and insurance provision: In July 2016, for example, leading construction risk management firm Hill International won a KWD3.9 million bid to construct two 300-bed secondary care hospitals in Ahmadi and Jahra. Due to be opened in 2019, the construction of three new hospitals is part of Dhaman's strategy to broaden its range of healthcare services to expats along with 15 primary health clinics across the country. In addition to this, expat-exclusive insurance services have been at the core of Dhaman's strategy. Currently, all expat workers are obliged to obtain a KWD50 health card in order to be granted residency. However, while Kuwaitis have free access to all public hospitals, expatriates with a health card are entitled to healthcare services in the country's public hospitals and primary care centers. In return, this has overstretched the capacities of the country's public healthcare facilities in terms of long waiting times for patients, overcrowding of hospitals, and a noticeable reduction in service quality. In this regard, Salem Haidar, Regional Vice-President of GlobeMed, told TBY: “Perhaps once expats are covered by Dhaman, it will ease pressure on public hospitals. But there has been a great deal of criticism that the government is putting the expats in one place and the Kuwaitis in another. As far as I can see, many people will continue to buy private insurance or top up additional coverage that will give them access to both Dhaman and other private hospitals. Things will become much clearer in the next couple of years.""</p><p>According to the Ministry of Health, Kuwait's health sector currently encompasses 7,000 public hospital beds and 1,000 private ones, which translates into three hospitals beds for 10,000 people. Paying from their own pockets, many Kuwaitis have consequently preferred treatment in private hospitals and medical centers. At the same time, government-subsidized medical tourism to the US, UK, or Germany has consistently been on the rise. With the government looking to nearly double the capacities of healthcare facilities until 2020, many facilities remain exclusive for Kuwaitis. Deemed as the largest hospital in the MENA region, for example, the 1,200-bed Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah Hospital will exclusively open its doors to Kuwaiti citizens in 2017. In light of high living costs in Kuwait, however, private hospital care is out of the question for numerous expatriate workers employed in various low-pay sectors. Though many employees in Kuwait's banking and financial services segment are covered by corporate medical insurance, others have to pay for the healthcare card, granting them access to public hospitals. Yet, costs for the very card are also set to nearly triple from KWD50 to KWD130 during 1Q2017, which will be a financial burden for many expat workers. Once fully operational, however, Kuwait's “economic backbone"" will be fully covered by high-quality insurance and state-of-the-art facilities. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","In view of the public health segment's overworking, the government launched a private healthcare scheme for its economy's “expatriate backbone.“","","Expatriate-exclusive healthcare","take-cover","1599","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405e","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A defining characteristic of Kuwait and its healthcare demographic is the exceptionally high number of expatriates living in the country; of the country's population of roughly 3.7 million, more than 2 million are non-Kuwaitis, or about two-thirds, primarily from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Egypt, and Syria.</p><p>The increased privatization of healthcare in Kuwait is a key aspect of the more than USD100 billion Kuwait Development Plan. The overhaul intends to reduce the price tag for the government, as well as place an emphasis on specialized treatment to dissuade locals from going abroad for healthcare.<br>Under the current scheme, nationals are able to receive healthcare free of cost at any public healthcare institution, while non-nationals must pay an annual fee of USD165 per person, in addition to surcharges for selected treatments and procedures. Proposed changes would prevent non-Kuwaitis from receiving care at such state hospitals, while new hospitals and polyclinics would be built specifically to cater to expats. In order to successfully achieve this, the government has created the Kuwait Health Assurance Company, a new megaproject equipped with some KWD230 million and tasked with building three new hospitals and 16 primary medical centers, which, together, will have the capacity to serve over 2 million expatriates in Kuwait under the new government insurance program.</p><p>Addressing the changing demands of Kuwaiti nationals, the government is set to roll out a new insurance scheme with private companies at the forefront, starting by providing private health insurance to the retired. Currently, Kuwaitis have the option of buying private healthcare and thus going to privately operated health facilities.</p><p>The Ministry of Health has plans to spend USD1 billion to build eight new hospitals and conduct hospital renovations or expansions, while the Ministry of Public Works has also earmarked over USD4 billion to construct nine additional hospitals, which together are set to increase the number of available beds at public facilities by approximately 3,334, in addition to providing some 15,000 jobs.</p><p>Many of the country's most common health issues have been wrought on by lifestyle choices and are namely obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. It has long been a standard practice for many Kuwaitis to leave the country and seek medical treatment for serious diseases abroad. Combating this is a key aspect of the government's healthcare sector overhaul. New policies created by the Ministry of Health specifically in response to the high rates of outbound medical tourism have already shown positive results. Since the ministry set out to increase the standards of Kuwaiti medical facilities, it reports that the number of locals traveling abroad for treatment has reduced by more than 50%.</p><p>With more nationals receiving treatment in Kuwaiti hospitals, not only does their reputation increase, but more money is kept in government coffers—and reduced spending is high on the government's list of priorities, given the budget deficit hit USD15 billion in 2015, attributable to the global slump in oil prices. According to the IMF, the country will need some USD116 billion through the coming six years in order to finance the deficit. With the government seeking to pay less for outbound medical tourism, new regulations supported by the Minister of Health would make it more difficult for patients to go abroad for treatment by requiring hospitals to make applications for treating a patient outside of the country, as well as stipulating that the Supreme Commission for Overseas Treatment, not the patient's hospital, has the final approval in the patient's case. Patients will be allowed an appeal, but only once.</p><p>The reason for many Kuwaitis traveling abroad is a lack of trust in the government administered healthcare system. As a result, private healthcare providers have seen a steady increase in customers. Among the score of new hospitals the government is financing, at least one is expected to be handed over to the private sector, with more government hospitals following suit if it proves successful. These hospitals will likely be managed by foreign, well-established healthcare companies.</p><p>Expected to open this year is the Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah hospital, the largest hospital in Kuwait and the region and one of the largest in the world. While the Ministry of Health is currently managing the hospital, plans are to fully hand the site over to a practiced hospital management company to operate the facility's more than 1,160 beds, trauma center, diagnostic and treatment services, dentistry division, and in and out patient services.</p><p>Demand for pharmaceuticals in the country has been on the rise in recent years, making Kuwait a prime location for multinational pharmaceutical companies to enter. BMI Research's Pharmaceutical Risk/Reward Index gave Kuwait a score of 53.3 out of 100 for the first quarter of 2017, a slight decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016, when it earned 53.4. Following the decimal decrease, the country is now ranked after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, making it only the fourth-most attractive market. The report suggests that diabetes and other diseases caused by a sedentary lifestyle that locals are increasingly adopting will lead to increased expenditures on diabetes-related products. Thus, the opportunities in the country for multinational pharmaceutical companies will only increase. </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/6b466f32-742e-43cc-8243-b7280e6f9c18.jpg","","","","Kuwait is in the midst of a total health sector overhaul.

In the wake of a low oil price environment, the government increasingly voiced its intention to privatize state-owned, food-security sustaining companies. With all sectors having been affected by privatization in line with the government's five-year development plan (2015-2020), food prices are likely to increase significantly. In order to balance supply and demand, meat prices could expectedly double.</p><p>According to the latest statistics from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), meat consumption in Kuwait averages around 120kg of meat per person per year. In light of steady regional population growth, the demand for meat in Kuwait is further estimated to rise even more over the next 10 years. However, desertification as well as a consequent lack of arable land has largely prevented Kuwait from cultivating domestic livestock that would ensure food security.</p><p>As a result, the Gulf state has largely been dependent on imports of foods and livestock paid for by oil revenues. In order to maintain food security, however, the government has established a number of companies such as the Kuwait Flour Mills &amp; Bakeries Company, the United Poultry Company, and the Livestock Transport &amp; Trading Company (KLTT) to not only import livestock and slaughter animals in compliance with the halal ritual, but to also import and produce basic foods.</p><p>As for Kuwait, Australia, and New Zealand constitute the major suppliers of sheep, for instance. Over the past 25 years, however, the number of heads exported to Kuwait has decreased from up to 170 million heads in 1990 by a little more than half. This was mainly due to drought, high costs for grazing of cattle, and animal rights organizations' objections against halal slaughtering.</p><p>Although Kuwait has long registered this decline to be unsustainable in the long run, alternative “countries of sheep origin"" such as India, China, or Ethiopia pose additional challenges. These do not only comprise higher shipment costs, but also an increased likelihood of livestock illnesses, having arisen from less sophisticated food infrastructures in the countries of origin.</p><p>Osama Boodai, CEO of the KLTT—the world's largest supplier of sheep—talked to TBY about his own initiatives in this regard: “For a new operation, we are starting with 3,000 ewes, local lambs, which we buy from the market to breed locally for the future. We will never cover the quantity needed for the country, but we want to start with something. The 3,000 will allow us to reach 50,000 in the next five years. This will form the new generation, which we will take for breeding.""</p><p>On a similar note, Dr. Sultan Alkhalaf, the Director General of Dar Al-Khalaf for Agricultural Studies &amp; Consultations, told TBY: “What we did at Dar Al Khalaf, for instance, was to prepare a feasibility study and consultation service for a Kuwait investor to establish a sheep production farm on 2.5 million sqm in Ethiopia. This project will produce 10,000 hybrid sheep, crossbreeding Ethiopian sheep with Arab Awassi sheep. Projects such as this will have a great effect on providing livestock for Kuwait."" </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","As one of the world's biggest consumers of meat, Kuwait is under pressure to diversify its sources of livestock and to establish domestic farms.","","Domestic food supply","is-it-meat-youre-looking-for","1656","552ef2b0361618126878404e","56cc3fca86b7b014bccb1aff","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a significant decrease in overall trade volumes in 2016, data from the Central Statistical Bureau's Annual Bulletin of Transport shed light on the sheer magnitude of goods that annually traverse Kuwait's major ports at Shuwaikh and Shuaiba. While the ports' export volumes fluctuated in the range of 4-5 million tons for the past 10 years, import volumes at the ports increased from 24.6 million tons in 2006 to 36.8 million in 2015. In light of an accounted 1Q2016 drop in the balance of trade by 76.2% compared to Q12015, the 2016 trade volumes at Kuwait's ports are likely to see a recess as well.</p><p>However, the Kuwait Ports Authority (KPA)—an independent agency established to oversee operations of the country's ports—does not see a reason for concern. In an interview with TBY, the KPA's Director General Sheikh Yousef Abdullah Al-Sabah highlighted: “We are working hand in hand with customs to expand the size of the plots because of the increase in incoming goods. The incoming goods increase YoY based on the natural increase of Kuwait's population. At the same time, however, it is also increasing because the current infrastructure projects require vast imports of different types of material, pipes, generators, and others for the different ministries and for the oil and gas sector."" For this, the KPA laid out a comprehensive strategy to transform Kuwait's ports into regional trade hubs by rapidly improving the efficiency of operations. Especially the introduction of a smart port system is key to this endeavor, as the ports' operations are set to be managed through a single online platform. Among other aspects, exporters and importers can not only track their goods, but also get their goods passed through customs much quicker.</p><p>As a matter of prudence to the vast number of large-scale infrastructure projects, the KPA is looking to increase the storage space of its ports by more than 3 million sqm. Particularly Shuaiba port will be subject to expansion, as it not only serves as a main point of entry for industrial and infrastructure supplies, but also as a main port of petroleum export. With Shuwaikh port increasingly experiencing congestion, however, Ossama Nazir, the General Manager of Maersk Line Kuwait, told TBY: “From what I have seen from working in multiple countries, customers end up following the tradition to just work with one port like the Shuwaikh port in Kuwait. Over time, the port can become congested. Customers put pressure on the service provider, and it is very difficult for them to upgrade the port and infrastructure because everyone wants to be there. KPA is now trying to move some port storage into Shuaiba to encourage customers to have more cargo going there. Not to offset the congestion per se, but to remove some of the pressure. KPA's campaign to push more cargo into Shuaiba will present better services and better services for us.""</p><p>In addition to this, Shuwaikh port is home to Kuwait's first-ever free trade zone (KFTZ), which, despite its vast potential for international investors, has posed a burden to the KPA. Similar to various warehousing companies having breached their tenancy agreements at the ports, the free trade zone's former private operator violated various laws, which eventually led the Public Authority for Industry to take over operations. With an underdeveloped infrastructure and storage facilities of up to 1.5 million sqm, the KFTZ's current profitability remains questionable, which finally led the KPA to call for a reintegration of the free trade zone into the port. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","With an ever-increasing number of imported goods, Kuwait's ports are currently expanding, becoming more integrated and less congested.","","Expansion of ports","small-ports","1500","552ef2b0361618126878404e","554c8ef286b7b0082093bb9f","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With a growing economy that continues to take steps toward greater diversification, logistics and transport have taken on renewed importance. Infrastructure spending will be key to developing the logistics sector, and plans are afoot for large scale, long-term projects. According to TradeArabia, the Kuwaiti government has plans to spend nearly USD15.6 billion on infrastructure projects in 2017, and the private sector is expected to play a major role in financing many of the projects. Government officials have revealed that they expect to finance close to 50% of the total expenditures, while almost 17% will come from the private sector and 34% will be contributed by the state-owned oil industry.</p><p>With ambitious expansion programs planned for transportation and logistics networks all across the country, Kuwait expects to develop into a regional and global leader in coming years. While declining oil prices have undercut government revenues, Kuwaiti leaders are committed to ensuring that the country has a world-class transportation infrastructure. On the back of this investment commitment, and growing activity by international and domestic logistics providers, the industry is poised for robust growth.</p><h4>Sea</h4><p>The planned expansion of the ports infrastructure will be a game changer in Kuwait, and authorities in government and private industry are excited about the various development plans slated for each area of operations. Each of Kuwait's four main ports are awaiting extensive renovations and expansions in the coming years. Mubarak Al Kabir Port is the newest port project in the country, and this USD4 billion project will be constructed in three phases and have a capacity of 2 million TEUs. Shuwaikh Port is set to receive a serious equipment upgrade, receiving new gantry cranes and various yard equipment, an advanced computer system and a much deeper and wider approach channel capable of accommodating some of the world's largest ships. Shuaiba Port is in the development stages for a new expansion, while Doha Port is undergoing an expansion aimed at increasing its commercial cargo handling capacity. According to the most recently available statistics from the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA), Shuaiba and Shuwaikh ports handle more than 840,149TEUs of cargo every year. With five other port projects in various stages of development, Kuwait's port infrastructure is well on its way to becoming one of the most advanced in the region. </p><p>In an exclusive interview with TBY, Sheikh Yousef Abullah Sabah Al-Nasser Al-Sabah, Director General of the Kuwait Port Authority, detailed the changes coming to the port system. According to Al-Sabah, the recently approved budget will entail the construction of between 3 to 4 million sqm of new storage space and the “transformation of three ports into integrated smart port systems with all control systems under one roof."" When these new projects come online, Al-Sabah expects Kuwait to become a world leader in shipping. “I believe if we implement our strategy we can reach USD600-700million in net profits and that would make us one of the top operating ports in the world,"" said Al-Sabah. Of particular note regarding the expansion and transformation plans for the Kuwaiti port system is the efficient smart port system. This will be one of the most advanced smart port infrastructures in the region and the world, and government officials and private industry leaders alike are excited about the changes it will mean for Kuwait's sea transport capabilities. </p><p>Kuwait's road infrastructure has faced serious pressure in recent years, and insufficient connectivity has led to growing congestion and frustration. In order to address these limitations, however, the Kuwaiti government has embarked on a robust investment plan aimed at expanding roadways across the country.<br>One of the major roadway projects currently underway is the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway, one of the most extensive and forward-looking roadway projects in the GCC. This 36.14km highway is expected to be finished in 2018, and more than 70% of the vital linkages connecting the Shuwaikh Port to Subiyah has already been completed, according to the Kuwait Times. Additionally, more than 50% of the Doha link, the section of road connecting Shuwaikh Port with the Doha highway, has already been finished. The cost of the project is nearly KWD739 million, and it will dramatically reduce the travel time between Kuwait City and Subiyah.</p><p>The country recently completed construction on the Jahra Road Development Project, another large-scale initiative aimed at improving connectivity and reducing driving times across the country. Consisting of 17.7km of viaducts—of which 8km are ramps, 2.4km are bridges, and 8km are mainlines—and costing nearly USD910 million, the project was a key project for the Ministry of Public Works. Upon its completion, travelers between Kuwait City and Jahra can now make the trip in record time.</p><p>Most of the public transportation infrastructure in Kuwait relies on the bus network operated by the Kuwait Public Transport Company (KPTC). According to the most recently available statistics, the KPTC's bus network transports around 50 million passengers across its 40 routes every year. Combined, two other bus companies, CityBus and KGL, transport a similar number of passengers.</p><h4>Rail</h4><p>Rail transportation is another important part of Kuwait's transportation infrastructure plans, and the country recognizes that extensive railways and roadways will be essential for ensuring the continued growth and prosperity of the country. By constructing commercial rail lines and passenger-oriented metro lines, the government hopes to position Kuwait for long-term growth.</p><p>The country's metro project is estimated to cost around USD7 billion and officials expect the lines to be operational by 2020. When completed, the project will have laid more than 160km of track and opened 69 new stations. While there have been some delays in construction, officials hope to have the first phase of the network completed by 2017. Additionally, the country's railway project is expected to cost USD10 billion and will consist of a 500km, fully integrated network that links the country's major areas and industrial sites. The system will also be linked to the GCC rail network, providing extensive regional shipping capabilities to logistics firms and private citizens alike. Projected to come online in 2018, the rail systems are one of the Kuwaiti government's transport crown jewels, and analysts predict that firms across a wide variety of sectors will benefit greatly from the investment. The KDIPA expects that maintenance and operations costs alone will generate between USD100-150 million a year for contractors. Design firms with experience in creating environmentally friendly structures and who follow the most comprehensive green building standards will also be given special opportunities to contribute, according to the KDIPA.</p><h4>Air</h4><p>Kuwait International Airport is the country's major center for air travel and serves as the hub for Kuwait Airways and Jazeera Airways. Servicing 10,848,550 travelers, according to the most recently available statistics, Kuwait International Airport handles the vast majority of air traffic in and out of the country. A new USD4 billion passenger terminal began construction in December of 2016 and is slated to be completed in six years. According to the Kuwait Times, the project is on track to be completed on time, and construction has progressed as planned. While there are some indications that issues may arise, Minister of Public Works Abdulrahman Al-Mutawa was confident that they would not adversely affect the project's expected completion date, according to the Kuwait Times. When completed, Kuwait International Airport will be among the largest in the world.</p><p>As passenger volumes have increased, so too have the number of airlines operating out of Kuwait International. In an interview with TBY, Hussein Alhasaseen, Area Manager of Kuwait for Royal Jordanian, discussed how the rise in operators have effected carriers like his. “Right now the competition is stiff,"" said Alhasaseen. “We used to have two competitors in 2015 and now we have four."" According to Alhasaseen, prices have dropped nearly 35%, which, though advantageous for fliers, has placed severe pressure on airlines operating in the country and across the region. With oil prices expected to remain low, full-service airlines are likely to continue seeing strong competition from budget carriers focused only on providing the cheapest flights possible.<br>Kuwait Airways has long dominated the skies of Kuwait, but its market share has also been falling recently as smaller players with lower prices have entered the market. To fend off some of its more aggressive competitors, Kuwait Airways has added a number of new aircraft to its fleet in recent years, and the company expects to add 22 more by the end of 2017.</p><h4>Logistics</h4><p>Between 2012 and 2016, Kuwait jumped 17 places in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, a move that reflects the country's commitment to the sector. With major international and domestic operators making headway in the country's competitive marketplace, industry observers expect the industry to enjoy robust growth.</p><p>Cheap fuel is one of the major strengths of the Kuwaiti logistics sector, and firms enjoy access to some of the lowest cost energy in the world. While high oil prices and production levels have fueled a sizable increase in imports, benefiting the logistics sector a great deal, some industry analysts fear that falling prices will prompt less consumer demand for foreign goods. This has the potential to negatively impact the sector in the short and medium term, but long-term economic growth and diversification are likely to offset the country's traditional reliance on the oil industry.</p><p>Regulation and complex bureaucracy have also slowed growth in the logistics industry, but officials are taking steps to ensure that the sector has the freedom it needs to operate more efficiently. Inordinately long documentation procedures have hampered the Kuwaiti logistics sector, but new, streamlined services are expected to correct much of the earlier problems. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/7ce10ed4-5054-4c6e-910c-34eacd5ae978.jpg","","","","As Kuwait finalizes its long-term development goals, transportation infrastructure has been a key area of concern, attracting multiple large-scale initiatives aimed at expanding key travel channels and developing new routes.","","","making-kuwait-great","1920","552ef2b0361618126878404e","554c8ef286b7b0082093bb9f","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-14T07:35:00.000Z","2017-06-14T07:35:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Government Gone .gov","<p>Addressing inefficiencies in Kuwait's public administration has been cited as the first out of seven key objectives under the 2017-18 development plan. At the center of this endeavor stands the digitalization and optimization of the country's complex civil service—a bulk of ministries, independent agencies, and state-owned corporations. According to a recent Accenture study, the digitalization of services plays a major role in economic growth, as it does not only lead to higher levels of innovation and competitiveness, but also often results in a GDP rise by 0.5% as well as a 2% increase in international trade volumes. In this regard, the Kuwaiti government has already made considerable progress in integrating the services provided by myriad government agencies. According to the United Nations' E-Government Development Index (EDGI), Kuwait has particularly ameliorated its e-government services over the past five years. Having started off as 63rd out of 193 countries in 2012, Kuwait climbed up to rank 40 in 2016. Outranking Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Kuwait's EDGI level is rated as “high“ and is regionally surpassed only by Bahrain (24th rank) and the UAE (29th rank).</p><p>This continuous advancement can largely be attributed to the Central Agency for Information Technology (CAIT), which respectively digitalized intra-governmental communication as well as governmental services. With the help of companies such as IBM, Microsoft, and Dell EMC, the CAIT significantly improved the efficiency of governmental operations notably through big data analysis and cloud computing services. On the one hand, the Kuwait Government Online (KGO) portal, e.gov.kw, now provides citizens, expatriates, tourists, and even companies with a platform through which they can access more than 1,600 e-government services. The majority of services is hereby covered by the KGO, as the user portal is categorized into family-related matters, immigration, employment, an awareness section, transport, housing, Islamic services, health, education, special needs, as well as cultural services. The most frequently used ones range from electronic payments (Tasdeed) for electricity and water bills or traffic fines to ID renewals and inquiries about phone bills and lawsuits. While the government's guarantee of employment to all Kuwaitis has been a decisive factor in the state apparatus' enhancement, Kuwaiti citizens can now also register at the KGO in case they are seeking employment in the public sector where 90% of the Kuwaiti labor force is currently employed. Furthermore, entrepreneurs are not only enabled to register a company and receive respective licenses from the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) through the portal, but may also retrieve information on current laws and regulations or can market their business. Even though a host of e-services of the Public Authority for Civil Information and the Ministry of Interior are not included in the KGO, the portal serves as an umbrella for the government's digital presence and also redirects users to authorities' websites that are not yet part of the KGO</p><p>On the other hand, the Kuwait Information Network (KIN) was launched in order to enable high-speed and cost-efficient communication among governmental agencies and NGOs. With the goal of centralizing the entirety of governmental communication, whether it is voice recordings, data, or images, the KIN is not only protected by an fiber-optic network to prevent hackers from stealing confidential data, but has also become mandatory for all government agencies. According to a recent cabinet decision, all governmental bodies will also no longer use official papers for intra-governmental communication from 2017 onward. On the contrary, official documents will be entirely replaced by a government-to-government messenger provided by the KIN. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Government","government-gone-gov","1599","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405a","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-14T07:20:00.000Z","2017-06-14T07:20:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","The Means  & the Message","<p>The ubiquitous application of ICT is felt across Kuwait's increasingly diversified economy as technology converges. It is galvanizing SMEs and delivering new platforms of e-health and e-government. In the industrial arena ICT is rationalizing manufacturing processes and enabling remote sensing and security monitoring. Ideas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks are also taking hold. Meanwhile, in the mobile arena, the retail consumer is looking beyond the necessity of voice to the endless possibilities of data, which today is king on telcos' balance sheets. Moreover, in the context of the broadcast and narrowcast media, the new paradigm of citizens as netizens has implications for the regulation of content, a task performed by the Ministry of Communications.</p><h4>A Measured Performance</h4><p>Kuwait places great store inthe knowledge economy, and it is worth noting that ICT-related investment exceeded USD1 billion in 2015, while an estimated CAGR of 2.4% to 2019 is forecast by BMI Research. Meanwhile, the Central Agency for Information Technology (CAIT) systematically traces sector indicators of take-up and attitude to better inform policymaking. Its recent publication, Consolidated Kuwait National ICT Indicators Report, 2016, provides a comprehensive evaluation of ICT in the home and workplace. Further in this chapter, sector players, too, explain some of the latest directions in which the local ICT sector is going, both in Kuwait and further afield.</p><h4>The facilities</h4><p>The government had moved early on to ensure high-speed internet capabilities, as fiber rollout commenced back in 2007 aimed at total geographical coverage. The Communication and Information Technology Regulatory Authority (CITRA), the independent telecoms regulator, was established in November 2014 to oversee disciplined ICT sector development. And so before we consider the media per se, let's briefly see where Kuwait stands today in terms of ICT capability, consumption, and its role in employment.</p><h4>Telephony: fixed... </h4><p>Fixed telephony, with a utilization rate of 56% as of 4Q2015, is fast losing out to mobile voice services.</p><h4>...and mobile </h4><p>As of 4Q2015, total mobile cellular telephone subscriptions were at 8,719,000, marking a high penetration of 240%, where 75% of mobile subscriptions were prepaid. Kuwait's 4G LTE network, the fourth-most comprehensive in the world, has virtually 100% geographical coverage since smartphones are in 99.7% of households, behind South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong.</p><h4>A Competitive Sector</h4><p>Kuwait has three mobile operators, namely Zain, VIVA, and Ooredoo. Saud Al Tawash, the CEO of Gulf Telecom, told TBY how market players in Kuwait have been chasing both scale and scope of operations. “We have recently seen a big shift in the industry with a few acquisitions where mobile operators have acquired ISPs. For instance, Zain has recently acquired Mada Communication, while Ooredoo has taken over Fast Telecommunications.“ Zain, 24.6% owned by the Kuwait Investment Authority, has a market share of around 35%. Noteworthy is its focus on R&amp;D, where it shares a Joint Innovation Center with Huawei geared to tomorrow's regional mobile and broadband services. Viva, with a 32% market share, prides itself on sourcing two-thirds of its workforce locally. The telco was listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange in December 2014 and in 1H2015 pioneered Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE) services, enabling high definition video calls. Given Kuwait's low population of around 4 million, the presence of three mobile operators has meant competitive data and voice tariffs, which pressures the margins of the fixed-line component. Official figures indicate that the country has around 840,000 dedicated mobile data subscribers, outnumbering fixed subscriptions twofold.</p><h4>Going Online</h4><p>While six out of 10 households have access to a computer or tablet, with around half of all households owning a tablet, just 3.7% of households had access to online TV channels according to the latest CAIT data. Kuwait has roughly 130,000 fiber connections, estimated to exceed 200,000 by 2019. Yet of the eight out of 10 households online, most rely on mobile broadband dedicated access services used via a USB modem, MIFI, or dongle.</p><h4>e-platforms</h4><p>Kuwait's Central Agency for Information has been tasked with overseeing the development of a comprehensive cross-platform featuring e-government and e-health, as well as the TASDEED cashless payment system enabling the online settling of bills, fines, or other official fees.</p><h4>Public Perception</h4><p>A 2015 internet usage survey provided a useful portrait of perception and practice. It indicated that while 89% of Kuwaitis polled felt that the internet provided a wider selection of products and 63% believed prices to be cheaper, just 29% of were comfortable revealing financial details online. Yet tellingly, just 10% of those canvassed thought more state regulation was the solution, with 50% stating that current controls were adequate. This arguably reflects public perception of censorship, which we will examine later. Meanwhile, the same survey saw 72% of respondents citing the internet as an important source of information, compared to 31% for TV and 13% for the press.</p><h4>The World of Work</h4><p>CAIT data puts the computer penetration rate among businesses at 86%, with 83% of firms canvassed having relied on the internet over the preceding year. Approximately 44% of companies in Kuwait are present online, with 24% running multilingual websites. In terms of employment, overall ICT manpower is estimated at 22,000, thus at just 0.9% of total manpower. And while Kuwaitis are slowly, but surely emerging from their public sector comfort zone, the state sector clearly claims the lion's share of ICT professionals. Some 60% of overall ICT jobs are held by expatriates, and 67% of ICT manpower has less than a decade of professional experience. The sector calculates that between 2016 and 2018 it will have required a further 7,000 ICT professionals. And encouragingly for the private sector, the most sought-after positions emerge as ICT marketing and sales within the ICT sector itself.</p><h4>The Media Landscape</h4><p>The seminal thinker of media theory, Marshall McLuhan, is renowned for countless pithy quotes, but one of the most relevant for today's media of converged technology is his insistence that, “First we build the tools, then they build us.“ Kuwait has 13 Arabic-language and two English-language newspapers, all privately owned and enjoying the liberty to publish broad content at their discretion, which in turn has fueled the advertising market. Again, the preference for public sector media employment where salaries are higher has negatively impacted the profession of journalism among citizens. And while international news sources are plentiful, they are scanned by the Ministry of Information (MOI) for perceived breeches of morality regarding the coverage of religion and the state itself. The MOI is also authorized to censor books, films, and periodicals. In the print sub-sector, Mohamed Aboukhaled, the General Manager of Al-Khat Printing Press, told TBY how his firm was “the first company in Kuwait to introduce an eight-color machine that could print 16 pages on two faces at the same time, at a speed of 17,000 copies per hour.“ And alighting on the difficulty of retaining employees, he added that the company annually sent “20-25 employees, whom we feel have a future with us, to Germany for training, which, while costly, can guarantee that the employee will stay with us for a minimum of two years.“ Also of note, while the firm caters to around 500 different clients, printing extensively for the Ministry of Education, it also holds the exclusive rights in Kuwait to print the Koran.</p><h4>Legislation</h4><p>The huge and rapid uptake of the internet has seen a shift from the question of what can technically be transmitted to what should morally be allowed. Thus, while Kuwait's freedoms of expression and the press are enshrined in Articles 36 and 37 of the constitution, the Press and Publications Law prohibits religious immorality and politically subversive messages.</p><p>To regulate the digital universe, a May 2014 law created the Commission for Mass Communications and Information Technology overseen by the communications minister. This commission has the power to revoke a phone, internet, cable, or satellite service license where content is deemed to harm public order. As part of this, internet cafes are obliged to note customer identities and disclose them at the MOC's request without fail. The scope of the commission's digital segment powers was underlined explicitly in the June 2015 cybercrime law, stipulating related fines and sentences for violations.</p><h4>New Solutions &amp; Markets</h4><p>Arabic is the fourth most-prevalent language used on the internet, which has opened up other potential markets across the MENA. Indeed, in 2015, this very prospect prompted IBM to open its first facility in Kuwait.</p><h4>Head in the Cloud</h4><p>The government is forging ahead with the promotion of Kuwait's SMEs, the growth of which is of fundamental significance for economic diversification away from hydrocarbons. While the financial sector has played a state-assisted role in funding these businesses, their ICT needs, too, are being met. Saud Al Tawash, the CEO of Gulf Telecomk, revealed that, “We have sought to introduce cloud-based services to the SME sector, which will occupy us for a few years yet.“ The advantages for the smaller enterprise are legion, as performing all ICT functions on the cloud cuts out the need for technical staff, infrastructure, or electricity expenditure at in-house data centers. Gulf Telecoms' larger clientele, too, makes great use of the cloud, where “many of our defense sector clients use these technologies to remotely connect to their thermal cameras on the border, (or) where users remotely control oil and gas pipelines, and connect globally through the cloud anywhere in the world.</p><p>It seems that going forward, saving on expenses will be a vital strategy, as well as pursuing margins. By way of a prognosis for 2017, Fajhan H. Al Mutairi, the CEO Tawasul Telecom, put it this way. “Generally, you can feel that the whole regional market is either standing still, or shrinking (while firms) do not want to spend money.“ His conclusion is that his firm performs well by meeting this criterion of cost effectiveness. It also seems that local businesses have much to compete for as, “All the international carriers are pulling out of having a physical presence here, (preferring) to leave, and act through another company.“ </p>","","","","","","","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/3a70c8c0-9269-4e3b-ae2b-aa6a8c7e4e50.jpg","","","","","","","the-means-the-message","2208","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b0361618126878405a","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-14T07:01:00.000Z","2017-06-14T07:01:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Under Construction","<p>With an annual population growth rate of approximately 4%, Kuwait has been under immense pressure to provide more than 100,000 housing units. In addition to welfare perks such as free education and healthcare or employment in the public sector, married Kuwaiti couples are, in fact, entitled to a 400sqm residence in the form of either a mansion or an apartment. This right to a house is further complemented by an interest-free KWD70,000 housing loan from the state. Notably, 80% of married couples in their 20s apply for government housing, according to a 2013 study from the London School of Economics. In the past years, however, demand for housing has by far exceeded the number of houses under construction. In this regard, the Public Authority for Housing Welfare (PAHW) currently receives more than 8,000 housing applications per year, which require an additional 75,000 units to be built by 2020. Kuwait's housing shortage further instigated the formation of Nater Beit, a civil society group pressuring the government to quickly resolve the issue, which stood out as a central theme in the November 2016 parliamentary elections as well. The importance that Kuwaitis place on this issue was further reflected in a recent Bayt.com survey in which 72% of respondents in Kuwait noted that affordable housing is the most important factor that makes a city worth living in.</p><p>Aside from the housing shortage, real estate prices in Kuwait have also skyrocketed as a consequence of many Kuwaitis, who already own property, making use of their “right to a house“ and selling it at a higher price. All the same, the mid-market and affordable housing segment promises stability in view of the rising demand in housing. In this regard, Khaled Al-Mashaan, Vice-Chairman and CEO of ALARGAN International Real Estate, told TBY: “We invest in secure properties that generate consistent revenues. The mid-market has been underserved for a long time, and it is the largest. After the crash, many companies realized the focus should not be solely on the high-end market. The Middle East has the highest growth per capita in the world, so there will continue to be an influx of buyers.“</p><p>As a consequence, the planned construction of new cities in the vicinity of Kuwait City has attracted contractors, real estate developers, and consultancy firms from around the world. Announced as Kuwait's largest housing project with nearly 30,000 units, South Al-Mutlaa City, for example, is set to accommodate 400,000 residents. Turkish construction giant Limak and Italian industrial group Salini Impreglio won the KWD288 million bid for developing the mixed-use project's infrastructure, which will also include leisure and sports areas, parks, mosques, and healthcare centers. In fact, more than 60 tenders for construction will continue to be offered by the Central Tenders Committee in the course of the project. Furthermore, the Minister of State for Housing Affairs, HE Yasser Hasan Abul, recently inked an MoU with the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport to develop Kuwait's first “smart“ city of South Saad Al-Abdullah. Similar to South Al-Mutlaa, eco-friendly South Saad Al-Abdullah will also encompass 30,000 housing units and is expected to accommodate up to 400,000 people.<br></p><p>Less of a city and more of a district, the Kuwait Projects Company's (KIPCO) Hessah Al Mubarak project stands out as one of the private sector's flagship projects for both high and low-income residents. Developed by Al Mutawir Real Estate Company and located outside of Kuwait City, the 38ha project will be Kuwait's very first mixed-use development project. In this regard, Omran Hayat, CEO of Al Mutawir Real Estate Company &amp; Chairman of SSH Design, told TBY: “We successfully participated in Hessah Al Mubarak—a mixed-use project that is 70% residential. We are in the infrastructure stage now.

Prices have declined across the market, and rents are likely to remain at low levels as investors, landlords, and renters figure out the market. Industry analysts anticipate more declines in early 2017, and residential apartment rents could drop a further 15%, according to Arabian Business.</p><p>However, recent statistics released by the NBK bode well for the sector. According to the bank, figures at the end of 2016 were strong, boosting monthly sales to six-month highs. Activity and sales remain somewhat slow, however, and YoY figures were down 22%. Sales totaled KWD2.04 billion and were also down by nearly 27%, though analysts at NBK consider these figures to represent a stabilization of previously steady declines.<br>In November of 2016, there were 244 residential sector sales worth KWD71.4 million. Tightening across real estate financing channels has also had a serious impact on the residential sub-sector, bringing YoY sales and transactions down 25% and 21%, respectively. Recording steady declines since early 2015, the national bank's residential home price index was 152.5 in November of 2016, down 12% from the same time last year. Additionally, the residential land price index has also been in the midst of a downward trend, and it currently sits at 178.2, down 9.5% YoY and 13% off its 2014 highs.</p><p>According to the NBK, investment sector real estate sales have also been on the decline, and the investment building price index was down 13% YoY in late 2016. 2015 was, however, a strong year for the sub-sector, and industry analysts foresee improvements in the second half of 2016. Commercial real estate has seen some improvement this year, but the increases were largely the product of a handful of extremely large deals. Year-on-year sales were up 5% from November 2015, and the two largest sales were commercial acreage in Sabah Al-Ahmad Sea City and Salmiya for KWD20.3 million and KWD2.6 million, respectively.</p><p>Certain categories of market health in residential and investment property were down in 2016. Average monthly sales for residential and investment property sat at KWD71.4 million and KWD57.9 million, respectively in November of 2016, down 10.6% and 1.2% from the year before. The transaction size had also declined to an average of KWD292,600 and 517,000, respectively, down 7% and 6.5% from the year before. As already mentioned, however, commercial property was up; driven by a handful of large investments, the sub-sector recorded 725% growth in sales (KWD82.5 million), 50% growth in number of transactions, and 450% growth in transaction size (KWD9.17 million).</p><p>Housing loan figures have also been on the decline, and in early 2016, total loan figures for new construction (KWD10.9 million) and additions and renovations (KWD2.2 million) were down, YoY, by 30.8% and 20.9%, respectively. The number of approved loans was also down YoY, dropping 31.7% in the new construction segment and 9% in additions and renovations. The news was not all bad, however, and in terms of absolute approved loan figures and the number of approved loans, new home purchases were up 11.3% and 30.3%, respectively, YoY.</p><p>As always, location is a key determinant of value and activity in Kuwaiti real estate. In Kuwait's six governorates, rent prices vary widely; in the second quarter of 2016, Hawalli Governorate, Al Asimah Governorate, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate, Farwaniya Governorate, Jahra Governorate, Ahmadi Governorate had residential rates (average sqm price) of KWD967.8, KWD937.7, KWD761.6, KWD672.4, KWD598.6, and KWD505, respectively. Additionally, investment sector rates were KWD1,896, KWD1,683.2, KWD1,230.6, KWD1,514.6, KWD1,764.7 and KWD1,431.2, respectively, while commercial rents were KWD4581.8, KWD10460, KWD1847.7, KWD3033, KWD4075, and KWD1847.7, respectively. According to data from the Kuwait International Bank, these rates represent a largely negative movement in price trends, though certain markets showed signs of improvement over last year's figures.</p><p>There has been some concern that falling prices could negatively impact the local banking sector and the IMF has warned that banks have large amount of direct exposure to the market. According to the IMF, local banks had 25% of their loans tied up in the real estate sector, and installment loans to households for home purchases was nearly 28% of their total loan portfolio. Additionally, 40% of their registered collateral is coupled to real estate, particularly in the commercial and investment sub-sectors. This has the potential to expose the banking sector to sizable risk if real estate continues to face falling price movements. The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) has not been silent in the face of these concerns and has taken steps to mitigate the possible risks. Residential real estate installment loans now require debt-service ratios of 40% and are limited to KWD70,000. The CBK is also in the midst of an attempt to tighten the ways real estate can be used as loan collateral by disallowing credit mitigation by 10% a year for a period of five years. </p><h4>Big Projects, Big Plans</h4><p>In order to address persistent housing shortages across the country the government of Kuwait has initiated a construction project called South Al-Mutlaa City. The USD20 billion planned city is expected to house nearly 400,000 people, and officials hope it will help address skyrocketing rents and excessive urbanization. The city will be housed on 102sqkm, 90 of which will be dedicated exclusively to residential use. The city is also set to include more than 120 schools, hundreds of mosques, an extensive medical and healthcare infrastructure, police, and other necessary municipal institutions, according to the The National. With more than 30,000 housing units, 156 schools, 179 mosques, 12 ambulance centers, 12 police stations, 48 group stores, 12 youth centers, and nine parks planned for the development, government officials and community stakeholders are confident that the initiative will go a long way towards easing the constrictions plaguing the market. Nor, however, is South Al-Mutlaa a one off; plans are afoot for a number of other planned cities in areas around Kuwait.</p><p>South Saad Al Abdullah is set to be constructed on 60sqkm and will include 20,000 homes and house 40,000 people. The South Korean government was contracted to orchestrate the construction project, and it is currently in the design phase. Another city, dubbed South Sabah Al Ahmad Sea City, will also be roughly 60sqkm in size. According to the Public Authority for Housing and Welfare, the city will have 11,794 housing units, integrated utilities infrastructure, 52 schools, 70 mosques, six distinct suburbs, 28 stores of various kinds, six police stations, and six health centers. Jaber Al Ahmad City will cover roughly 1,250ha, and include 6,679 housing units. The city will boast 36 schools, 31 mosques, four separate suburban areas, 18 suburbs, two police stations, three health centers, and a government compound. These extensive projects are but a taste of the ambitious housing goals the government of Kuwait has set for itself. Once online, new developments are expected to play a major role in reducing housing pressures across the country; identified as high priority projects by the government, these extensive cities are game changers for the Kuwaiti real estate industry, and they promise to spur economic activity across a number of industries and sectors in Kuwait.</p><h4>Retail</h4><p>With one of the highest average income levels in the world, retail, particularly luxury retail, is an important component of Kuwait's economy. According to international consultancy Marmore, the key retail segments in the country are consumer electronics, automobiles, apparel, watches and jewelry, footwear and handbags, and cosmetics. High incomes make the country attractive to luxury brands, and a number of well-known companies have established a major presence in areas across the country. Malls are still the number one venue choice for consumers interested in purchasing luxury goods, though hypermarkets and online shopping are gaining a larger foothold, according to Marmore. With 712,000sqm of retail space available in late 2015 and 174,680 additional square meters expected to be built by 2017, the segment is enjoying sizable growth.<br>According to Marmore, a high internet penetration rate, nearly 75%, has contributed to the growing popularity of online shopping, and the segment is expected to be worth USD1.07 billion by 2020. Kuwaitis across the country are adopting new shopping technologies at impressive rates, and the segment is expected to be a key driver of growth in coming years. </p><p>Plans for large-scale malls have been developed across Kuwait, and developers are confident that the demand remains to support new entries. The Al Kout Mall development is one such project, and the complex, located in the Ahmadi governorate, is set to include 260 stores and will have six distinct experiential offerings, including hospitality, shopping, a marina, a fishing wharf, leisure, and entertainment. The project, which is ahead of schedule, is set to open in October 2017 and represents a new trend in retail spaces in Kuwait, namely the experientially oriented shopping excursion. Developers recognize a growing interest amongst Kuwaiti consumers for an environment that gives them access to a world of possibilities and pleasures without the hassle of leaving the air-conditioned confines of a luxury shopping mall. Al Kout's 300,000sqm of space and 1.6 km of beach front will be the largest mixed-use waterfront destination and present Kuwaiti shoppers and visitors a new standard of retail that is expected to set the bar for many projects to come. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/e37dc9c2-7f4e-4a7f-af68-664610df88c1.jpg","","","","As new housing projects come to completion, Kuwait's persistent housing shortages are expected to be alleviated, and a new generation of citizens will enjoy a new standard of residential living.","","","the-good-life-kuwait-2017","1572","552ef2b0361618126878404e","578390fb86b7b02314e1b5ac","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-14T05:12:00.000Z","2017-06-14T05:12:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Crossing the Bridge","<p>Widely considered to be the flagship infrastructure project planned under the government's five-year development plan, the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway Project (SJSC) is on schedule to be completed by the end of 2018. The causeway constitutes a prime example of the government's successful implementation of the public-private partnership (PPP) model to not only bring about much-needed infrastructural renovations, but also to provide a sustainable financing solution with it. Despite staggering temperatures of up to 53 degrees Celsius, sandstorms, and high humidity levels at the construction sites, thorough feasibility studies and novel concreting methods have been crucial to meeting the operational challenges of one of the region's most complex infrastructure projects. With a total estimated project cost of more than KWD738.75 million, which is equivalent to more than USD2.5 billion, the megaproject will accommodate one of the largest ocean-crossing causeways in the world. </p><p>Consisting of two causeway links, the SJSC's main link will encompass a 36.1km bridge with six lanes in both directions across Kuwait Bay, connecting Shuwaikh Port in Kuwait City to newly developed Subiyah New Town. Tendered by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) until 2013, major engineering and design powerhouses including SYSTRA Design, Hyundai, and DONGBANG Engineering eventually formed a consortium to design, construct, and complete the flagship project's main link. With traffic congestion being especially preeminent in Kuwait City, the SJSC's main link will not only decongest the country's capital, but will also expectedly shorten travel time between Shuwaikh and Subiyah by 40 minutes. Moreover, Kuwait City, which is part of the Al-Asimah Governorate, as well as neighboring governorates, such as Mubarak Al-Kabeer, or Hawalli, constitute areas of high population density. In this regard, the new causeway will further contribute to bridging the gap between Kuwait's “North-South"" divide. Furthermore, two artificial islands on the SJSC's northern and southern side will house maintenance and fuel stations. On the other hand, the SJSC's additional “Doha link"" will reduce road congestion and provide a faster connection between the Shuwaikh Port area and Entertainment City in the western Doha peninsula. Adjacent to the SJSC's main Subiyah spur, the causeway's Doha link will also extend across a 7km sea bridge across Sulaibikhat Bay and ultimately connect with Doha Expressway. With estimated costs of up to KWD169 million, the causeway's Doha link roughly accounts for one-fourth of overall project costs. Given the project's complexity, however, the causeway's two links have separately been called for tenders. Accordingly, a different consortium, consisting of GS Engineering &amp; Construction, Dar Al Handasah, and SSH Design, was formed to handle the design, construction, and maintenance of the Doha link. Moreover, nearly two years before the project's contractual end date of November 2018, the MPW recently announced that more than one-third of the causeway's Doha link is already complete.</p><p>With the constructing site reclaiming more than 1.5 million sqm of land, the SJSC is set to transform the country's infrastructure and the mobility of Kuwaitis for years to come. In addition to catering for a host of much-needed viaducts, bridges, drainages, and intelligent transport services, the causeway is a success story in terms of foreign companies being directly involved in turning Kuwait into a regional transportation hub. In view of this, the causeway project is on a par with various infrastructural improvements including port redevelopments, the construction of a new terminal at Kuwait International Airport, as well as major road renovations. Incorporating various state-of-the-art construction technologies and intelligent transport systems, the SJSC nonetheless constitutes the centrepiece of the government's infrastructural ambitions to align Kuwait with the rest of the GCC to enable the country's transformation into a post-oil “knowledge economy."" </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","Due to be completed in 2018, the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Causeway Project is the government's flagship project to transform Kuwait into a regional transportation hub.","","Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway Project","crossing-the-bridge","1682","552ef2b0361618126878404e","57d0140486b7b005041ffeab","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Announced as part of the government's strategy to meet its deficit targets in a low oil price environment, fuel prices increased by roughly 80% in September 2016, eventually triggering the resignation of the cabinet and the dissolution of the national parliament. Although the gridlock over fuel price increases followed a number of policy disputes over subsidy cuts, it should come as no surprise that Kuwait's automotive segment and its burgeoning consumer base have become key economic players.</p><p>According to the 2015 Annual Statistical Bulletin of Transport, the number of operating vehicles has been estimated at more than 1.9 million in 2015. With more than 75% of vehicles in private ownership, the 10-year trend suggests that the number of vehicles has not only incrementally risen over the past 10 years, but will further increase until 2020 at the very least. These numbers are further reflected in the regional automotive industry, given that the GCC car fleet steadily increases at a growth rate of 5%. In fact, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait are expected to make up nearly 75% of the GCC's car fleet until 2020.</p><p>These positive developments have been crucially facilitated by long-standing distribution authorizations and import dealerships between international automobile manufacturers and a number of family-owned companies. As the authorized distributor of Toyota's cars—the most popular automotives in Kuwait—Al Sayer Group, for instance, has obtained a significant share in the Kuwaiti automotive segment. The group has not only sold Toyota's cars for more than 50 years, but has also cemented its leading position in the car rental industry—a market segment that is expected to reach overall revenues of almost USD300 million until 2020. Most notably, however, a number of family conglomerates such as Alghanim, Behbehani, Al-Mulla, and Al-Babtain either started off in the automotive segment or eventually managed to obtain a crucial market share. In an interview with TBY, Al-Babtain's Group CEO Saleh A. Al-Babtain described how a car dealership with Nissan marked Al-Babtain Group's rise to success: “Operating for 65 years now, we are one of the oldest groups in Kuwait. We started in the automotive business in the late 1940s and, after that, we grew along with the discovery of oil in Kuwait. Eventually, we diversified and invested in automotive and real estate development which aligned with the business needs of the country. […] It is important in terms of size and revenue and I would put it as over 50% of our business but the other sectors of the group's investments should not be undermined. With regard to the automotive business, however, we are the agents for Nissan and are the second-biggest dealer in the world after Thailand.“ </p><p>With international automobile manufacturers having cemented a top-performing supply chain with local family businesses over the years, various macroeconomic factors have facilitated a continuously rising demand for cars. While Kuwait's strong currency and its population's high disposable, tax-free income encourages high consumption patterns, the country's vast retail banking segment provides favorable loan and insurance options. Moreover, despite the recent surge in fuel prices, gas still remains at an affordable cost. Although Kuwait's infrastructure has been rather unprepared for the vast increase in operating vehicles over the years, a wealth of large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly new roads and bridges, are further set to significantly reduce traffic congestion in Kuwait. What finally remains unaddressed, however, is a comprehensive strategy to deal with the most fatal consequence that the burgeoning automotive industry has brought about: Over the past 10 years, the Ministry of Interior registered more than 4,265 motor vehicle casualties—a staggering number that is unfortunately set to further increase in light of the automotive industry's upward momentum. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Automotive industry","two-lane-blacktop","1519","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This time, the Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) initiated the Clean Fuels Project (CFP) to place Kuwait amongst the top producers in the downstream industry.</p><p>The project aims to expand and redevelop the Mina Al-Ahmadi (MAA) and Mina Abdullah (MAB) refineries, with 346,000 and 454,000bpd, respectively, bringing total capacity to 800,000bpd. The two refineries will also be linked to create an integrated refining complex, with increased flexibility to cater to growing and changing local and international demand. Lastly, the project envisions enhancing the performance of both refineries by optimizing energy usage and implementing better safety and operational regimes. As part of the project, KNPC plans to permanently close the Al-Shuaiba refinery and channel its outpost into the expanded refineries, as well as into the new greenfield refinery complex, Al-Zour, which will open in 2018.</p><p>The primary innovation is the conversion of high sulfur oil with low value into higher-value products with sulfur levels of no more than 5%. To achieve this, new technologies include a gas oil desulphurization station, a vacuum distillation unit, and a delayed coking unit, as well as a sulfur-recovery system. Furthermore, the two refineries will be upgraded to produce diesel and kerosene for export.</p><p>In line with commitments made by HH Al-Amir during the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, Kuwait is taking steps toward the production of fuel with cleaner output in integrated and more energy-efficient production facilities.</p><p>In April 2016, KNPC concluded a domestic loan of USD3.9 billion for investments in the CFP project, put together by NBK and Kuwait Finance House and supported by a group 11 banks. For further financing, KNPC anticipates to attract another USD4 billion loan for further investments, this time with foreign lenders. According to KNPC's CEO, Mohammad Ghazi Al-Mutairi, the loan will be backed by South Korean, Dutch, British, and Italian export credit agencies.</p><p>Due to available resources, manpower, and the overall scope and impact of the project, the contracts were divided into three packages: one for MAA and two for MAB. The EPC package, the first for MAA, was inked by a consortium of the Korean GS E&amp;C, SK E&amp;C, and the Japanese JGC Corporation and has a total value of KWD1.36 billion. The second package has a contract value of KWD1.1 billion and is led by Petrofac and supported by Samsung Engineering and CB&amp;I Nederland.</p><p>The third package, for the redevelopment of the Mina Abdullah refinery, went to a consortium led by Fluor, in cooperation with Daewoo Engineering &amp; Construction and Hyundai Heavy Industries, for KWD962 million. Fluor was also responsible for the front end engineering design (FEED) of this project, with preliminary design support of the Engineering Consultants Group (ECG).

Whether through the expansion of critical business lines or by embarking on a fresh approach, local companies are taking the appropriate steps to ensure that Kuwait's industrial output increases by 25% in coming years, a goal laid out by Mohammad Al Ajmi, Director General of the Public Authority for Industry (PAI). Increased production will, in turn, play a vital role in boosting export revenues. Recent figures show that organic chemicals were valued at 2.2% of total exports, followed by plastics and plastic products at 1.7%, revealing that there is still much room to grow.</p><p>Kuwait's key petrochemical products include ethylene glycol, which used in polyester fibers, polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging, antifreeze and coolants, paints, resins, deicing fluids, heat transfer fluids, and construction materials. According to the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority, the country's petrochemicals output is set to increase from 7.6 million tons per year in 2014 to 10.5 million tons per year in 2019</p><p>Such growth would support Kuwait as it fends off a budget deficit of roughly USD40 billion going into 2017. With the ambitious Kuwait Development Plan 2015-2020 and over USD100 billion of infrastructure investment spearheading the non-oil sectors along, the industry sector overall could see up to 4% growth in 2017.</p><h4>CHEMICAL CONNECTION</h4><p>Kuwait's petrochemical giants represent the lion's share of industrial activity in the country, with EQUATE Petrochemical Company, Hempel Kuwait, and Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC), as well as its subsidiaries, being some of the forerunners.</p><p>EQUATE, Kuwait's first international joint-venture petrochemicals company, is the source of over 60% of Kuwait's export value from non-oil sources. Since its inception, the company has influenced the local plastics industry by directly triggering substantial 450% growth. In turn, much of EQUATE's activity has supported local manufacturers as they seek to launch export operations. Adding to its list of firsts, EQUATE is pioneering in the US market by investing in the development of a world-class ethylene glycol plant with a capacity of 750,000 metric tons annually. The plant's construction is set for completion in 2019. Now the world's second-largest producer of ethylene glycol with a 12% market share, EQUATE has its sights set on rising to the number one rank among ethylene glycol producers.</p><p>Coming off the heels of a successful year, EQUATE's main achievement has been the acquisition of MEGlobal as a wholly owned subsidiary, shifting the company from being a local operator in Kuwait to becoming a global player with operations in Canada, Germany, and the US. “EQUATE is the first Kuwaiti company to issue 144A transaction bonds that are tradable in the US. With a value of USD2.25 billion, the bond issuance is considered the largest-ever in Kuwait's history and it is the Arabian Gulf's largest bond issuance since 2014,“ Mohammad A. Husain, President &amp; CEO of EQUATE Petrochemical Company, told TBY, adding, “This is following EQUATE securing  investment-grade ratings by S&amp;P and Moody's, two of the largest independent rating agencies.“ The company is also moving into sukuk, with plans to issue its first sukuk in the short term. In 2016, the company finalized a critical de-bottlenecking project, increasing its polyethylene production capacity from 825,000 tons annually to almost 1 million. The joint venture, which is comprised of US-based Dow Chemicals as well as local firms Petrochemical Industries Company, Boubyan Petrochemical Company, and Al Qurain Petrochemical Industries Company, also announced plans to build a 200,000sqm industrial complex in Al Shuaiba.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hempel Kuwait is continuing its many years of success in Kuwait by capitalizing on the need for industrial-grade paint and other supplies. Originally founded in response to demand for paint for storage tanks and related products, Hempel Kuwait switched over to supplying architectural protective coatings for a wide variety of buildings. Although the company's products primarily serve as decorative coatings, its paints also protect against deterioration. “On the group level, we also manufacture other coatings for containers… Hempel Kuwait is also exporting to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Qatar, as Kuwait was the only producing hub for them,“ Sukumar Pampala, General Manager of Hempel Kuwait, explained in an interview with TBY. Over the short term, Hempel Kuwait will be commissioning a state-of the-art paint products plant on July 1, 2017. Currently, approximately 80% of the factory is complete, with the remainder in progress.</p><p>Complementing private sector actors, state-owned oil producer KPC produces 1.8 million tons of ethylene, 825,000 tons of polyethylene, 1.2 million tons of ethylene glycol, and 829,000 tons paraxylene per year. Showing promise, Kuwait's Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) has designed a strategy for the year 2040 aimed at expanding the volume of its petrochemical production up to 16 million tons annually. PIC's output currently stands at 8 million tons, including 3 million tons of fertilizer, 2 million tons of olefins, and 2 million tons of aromatics.</p><p>In October 2016, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry announced that it had approved a request from KPC to establish a new subsidiary, Kuwait Integrated Petrochemical Industries, for a series of refinery and petrochemicals projects. The company is planning to launch with USD6 billion of capital and will be responsible for the execution of several major downstream projects, such as the Al Zour refinery and petrochemicals complexes. The complexes, which are slated for completion in 2019, will boast a combined production capacity of 615,000bpd.</p><h4>IN THE ZONE</h4><p>Kuwait's indsutrial sector thrives largely due to the abundance of tax-friendly industrial zones—regions set aside specifically for the development of the diversification of the economy and the promotion of manufacturing.</p><p>The USD528 million Al Naayem Industrial Zone was launched by the PAI in 2015 for companies operating in the area of heavy industries. This recently established zone complements Sabhan Industrial Zone, which recently received investments totaling in excess of USD39 million and uniting to form Block 11.</p><p>In 2016, the Kuwait Industries Union (KIU) unveiled its intentions to put 1,056 industrial plots on the market within the USD264 million Al Shadadiyah Industrial Zone, spurring increased activity and development in the area. As of October, the KIU had already approved more than 230 applications for new industrial projects in West Shuaiba, Amghara, and Sabhan. West Shuaiba, for example, is the new home of over 35 industrial investment projects valued at well over USD3 billion. This announcement trails just behind an initiative led by KIU and the Public Authority for Manpower to establish a single-window electronic portal designed to facilitate registrations in industrial zones. By the end of 2016, the KIU had already completed more than 150 transactions under the new system. Simultaneously, new regulations introduced as part of Kuwait's 2013 FDI law make it easier for local operators and zone authorities to attract foreign tenants. Now, local companies can benefit from up to 100% foreign equity or a branch of an international company to invest in the country.</p><p>However, Kuwait's industrial activity is not restricted to zones within the country itself. The Kuwait-based Integral Plastic Industries is slated to establish a USD272 million plant in Abu Dhabi's Khalifa Industrial Zone (KIZAD) in 2017. Currently being developed over a 2.16ha plot, the manufacturing plant will produce 15,000 tons of plastic bottles, caps, and packing strip rolls per year. The target date for production at the facility is currently scheduled for 1Q2018. Remarking on the project in an interview with the press, Khaled Al Saleh, CEO of Integral Plastic Industries, explained, “Our decision to invest in KIZAD was a result of its attractive business model which features an integrated infrastructure in a prominent location and easy access to regional markets through Khalifa Port.“</p><h4>ALTERNATIVES</h4><p>As oil prices remain low, some industry players that have typically relied on oil and gas production have braced for change by seeking profitable alternatives. Investing in capital while prices are low and adding value to the renewable energy sector are two ideas on the table.</p><p>Ikarus Petroleum has taken the initiative by purchasing oil tankers at a discount rate, with hopes to resell the capital in a few years' time when prices increase once again. Prompted by dwindling share value in its investments in Saudi Arabia, where 75% of the company's equity portfolio is located, Ikarus Petroleum is also turning toward renewable energy as a way to diversify. “A revival of [the oil and gas] industry will occur hopefully in early 2018, so in the meantime Ikarus has to find alternative sources of profitable ventures, which is why we are looking at opportunities in tankers and renewables,“ Nader H. Sultan, Chairman of Ikarus Petroleum Industries, told TBY.<br></p><p>In response to climate trends and price forecasts, Kuwait has set up sector-specific funds that include industrial manufacturing in renewable energy, with the aim of attracting technological innovation to Kuwait itself. EnerTech is Kuwait's USD50 million renewable energy fund, focused on projects in collaboration with Kinetic Renewable Energy Services, a Dubai-based developer of renewable power plants. If EnerTech discovers any promising technology, the government of Kuwait will step in to help it set up manufacturing and distribution in Kuwait, as well as several other Gulf countries. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/d3925d26-2a2a-406a-84c6-0454d5821d56.jpg","","","","","","","thick-thin","1959","552ef2b0361618126878404e","5537a9ba86b7b412f8a4631d","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The government is sparing no expense or effort on its development plan, and the construction sector in particular is set to be the largest recipient of state funding, one of the largest in the region even though lower oil prices have dampened spending in most oil-exporting countries. The amount of construction projects has consistently grown in recent years, jumping from USD25 billion in 2014 to USD47.2 billion in 2015, and the National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) noted in a report that the government sought to sign up to USD55 billion in contracts for 2016 to ensure that development projects would continue as planned. Given the slew of contracts across a vast array of sectors, the Kuwaiti construction sector has seen consistent growth even in challenging times in the region, posting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.23% between 2011 and 2015. Timetric in a report on the Kuwaiti construction sector predicted that the various initiatives by the government to boost infrastructure development will ensure that the sector will see a CAGR of 6.44% from 2016 to 2020. Infrastructure construction in particular comprised the third-largest market in the local construction industry in the last five years, accounting for 20.5% of the total industry's value in 2015. The market grew at a CAGR of 8.82% that year, increasing from KWD446.8 million in 2011 to KWD626.6 million in 2015. Timetric in fact believes infrastructure construction will grow to be the largest sector in the country by 2020 and record a CAGR of 19.22%, worth USD5 billion in total and primarily the result of the government's grand infrastructure plan.</p><p>To support a further increase in private participation and entice private-sector companies to work on the many multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects in the country in the coming years, Kuwait has revamped its public-private partnership (PPP) legislation, which has subsequently led to an uptick in PPP activity. A slew of foreign and domestic investments has come in on projects to develop Kuwait's road, railways, highways, and port infrastructure. In particular, amendments were made to the Direct Investment Law, PPP Law, and Capital Market Authority Law to provide greater clarity on the exemptions available to foreign investors and the associated procedural requirements, cutting down on red tape, for example new regulations that allow companies to be set up in just 30 days. The 2015-2019 Development Plan envisions the participation of the private sector through at least eight PPPs and the NBK expects the total value of awarded projects in 2017 to reach USD38.1 billion. Mutlaq Mubarak Al-Sanei, the General Manager of the Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects (KAPP), the agency behind such projects, noted in an interview with TBY, “It is a challenge to introduce PPP laws to Kuwait's business culture and guide it to adapt and adjust. We have to disseminate awareness of such projects and their requirements, as institutions need time to adapt and deal with this new culture successfully."" Commenting on the status of key projects in the country, Al-Sanei said, “While some projects such as the Kuwait National Rail Road Project or South Al-Jahra Labor City are in the pre-tender phase, others such as the Az-Zour North Power Generation, the Water Desalination Project phase 2, the Umm Al Hayman Wastewater Project, and the Municipal Solid Waste Project are currently under tender.""</p><p>The lion's share of awarded contracts in 2016 was in transport infrastructure, with the sector accounting for 34% of the value of planned projects in 2016. The Ministry of Public Works' USD11.3 billion-plan for infrastructure projects in 2016 featured several key projects. One of the largest is the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway across Kuwait Bay, built at an estimate cost of USD3 billion and linking Kuwait City and the Subiyah area. The project, one of the largest and most challenging transport infrastructure projects not just in Kuwait but in the Middle East, is set to be completed in 2018 and will include a 36km, cable-stayed bridge and two man-made islands measuring 30ha in total. The islands will feature government buildings, a marina, and green spaces. The ministry in 2016 also awarded a contract for the construction of a terminal at Kuwait International Airport. Due to be completed by 2022, the USD4.4 billion project involves the construction of a new terminal building over an area of 708,000sqm able to accommodate 25 million passengers a year, 51 gates, a 400-bed hotel, waiting rooms, and parking for 5,000 vehicles. The government also separately launched work on development projects worth USD4 billion for the construction of new roads and bridges across the country and upgrading existing road networks. Other projects on the cards include a USD600 million road connecting the sixth ring road to the Salmi border crossing with Saudi border, developments of the North and East Regional Highway estimated to cost USD1.6 billion to facilitate the growth of inter-regional and international trade with GCC states, and 18 different contracts worth USD541.5 million to construct and repair roads all across the country. In June 2016, the Ministry of Public Works also awarded a USD1 billion contract to an Italian-Turkish consortium for major infrastructural works for the South Al Mutlaa City project, which will house close to 400,000 people when completed. South Al Mutlaa is the first of five major new cities being developed by the Kuwaiti government.</p><p>Given that about 95% of Kuwait's total export earnings come from the oil and gas sector, it is no surprise that energy and utilities construction comprises one of the largest markets in the Kuwaiti construction industry, accounting for 26.1% of the total value in 2015. Kuwait Petroleum announced in 2016 the country had earmarked USD98 billion for oil projects over the next five years, including the construction of four gathering centers, a new 615,000bpd refinery, a project to upgrade two refineries under a clean fuel project, and a platform for LNG imports. In addition, some USD4.8 billion of the total USD12 billion in contracts awarded in Kuwait in the first nine months of 2016 were oil and gas-related contracts. According to the NBK, one such project is a USD2.9 billion contract handed out by the Kuwait National Petroleum Company for the construction of a LPG import and regasification terminal. The Kuwait Oil Company also conducted tenders for three projects worth USD5.7 billion on a Jurassic non-associated gas reserves project that seeks to produce 10,400 tons of natural gas a day. Other projects in the pipeline include a USD480 million project to develop the Sabriyah and Umm Niqa fields and a USD785 million pipeline to connect the Al Zour oil refinery in the south and the South Tank farm in Ahmadi. The Kuwait National Petroleum Company also seeks to develop a refinery near Kuwait City with the capacity for 615,000bpd, which is expected to be the largest chemical plant in the world when it opens. In addition, given the national aim to increase the share of energy generated from renewable sources to 15% by 2030, the power sector similarly is expected to continue to receive significant funding. One such key project is the Az Zour North independent water and power project (IWPP) during the first half of 2017. KAPP's Al-Sanei affirmed that the agency had received the bids for phase two of the Az Zour North IWPP, noting that “The Az-Zour Phase I project has been proof of the huge success of PPPs and its benefit to the economy.""</p><p>Financing of construction projects in healthcare was also one of the main drivers of the construction industry's growth in 2016. There are currently more than 20 large-scale mega healthcare projects currently in the pipeline in Kuwait estimated at USD12 billion, Business News Construction (BNC) reported in 2016. In addition, six of the largest 10 projects in Kuwait in 2016 are based on the construction or refurbishment of hospitals, worth approximately USD5.5 billion in total. The largest such project is the Kuwait Maternity Hospital, a USD790-million, 600-bed hospital that can accommodate 36,000 births annually. Other projects in the healthcare sector awarded in 2016 include the Jaber Ahmed Al Jaber Al Sabah Hospital over an area of 47,000sqm and valued at USD1.6 billion, an expansion of Farwaniya Hospital estimated to cost USD1 billion, and a dedicated children hospital set to cost USD850 million.</p><p>With extensive funding for major infrastructure projects, a revamped approach to PPPs, and key developments across major sectors, the only way forward for Kuwait's construction is up. </p>","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/articles/db931c75-f70f-4a2f-aee0-18a997641765.jpg","","https://thebusinessyear.com/Content/headerImages/bb72f281-930d-47b0-9320-1685125dd456.jpg","","Massive investments across several sectors, in particular infrastructure, energy, and healthcare, will continue to drive construction activity in Kuwait.","","","built-to-last-kuwait-2017","2079","552ef2b0361618126878404e","57d0140486b7b005041ffeab","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2017-06-13T10:54:00.000Z","2017-06-13T10:54:00.000Z","TBY","","publish","Oversight  Spells  Underwriting","<p>Despite some upward movement in penetration over the years, the Kuwaiti insurance sector, compounded by the economic fallout of new oil, faces key headwinds, some of which are familiar to other sectors of the economy. Meanwhile, the lack of a regulator has curbed the streamlined and efficient growth of the sector, today largely prone to price competition in a crowded market.</p><h4>Building Premiums on Infrastructure</h4><p>""When in doubt, build"" seems to be a widespread political response to an economic challenge. And certainly, despite efforts to curb public spending, Kuwait's Vision 2035 foretells investments of around USD100 billion, toward economic diversity. This will no doubt be felt warmly in the insurance sector, notably the non-life segment through vast engineering schemes, while the expatriates arriving to work on them will build life product premiums. Consumer confidence, too, often results, whereby consumption of insurable quantities such as property and cars heads north.</p><h4>The Paternalist Enigma</h4><p>While rightly beloved by the citizen with ingrained life-long expectations of the state, Kuwait's welfare system is the bane of the private sector, fundamental to economic diversification. This applies to insurance, too. The country provides all citizens with free medical care, whereby a tiny life segment (one-third of non-life) is largely capped by the comprehensive, and gratis, provisions of the social security system. Nonetheless, the current health insurance policy for expatriate personnel costs a foreigner a minimum of KWD130 per annum, although discounts apply for families. And since the expatriate community comprises two-thirds of the total population, it follows that this is a lucrative proposition for the insurance sector.</p><h4>Indifference and Concentration...</h4><p>The insurance sector in Kuwait printed a total gross premiums written (GPW) of USD1.01 billion in 2014, thereby contributing approximately 4.5% to regional GPW. As of that year, insurance penetration and density were respectively at 0.6% and USD291. Life insurance growth, while moderate, has been limited by the above-mentioned public indifference to insurance as a wealth management and savings tool. That said, greater affluence plus an educated workforce are seen as fertile soil to chase policies on, going forward. The insurer, though, is hard pressed to foster public awareness of preparation for the unforeseen. Unsurprisingly, then, Moody's in late 2015 identified the local sector as fractured, where 23 domestic firms, two being reinsurers, and 10 foreign entities chased premiums. Furthermore, the crowd since 2000 had swollen due to the opportunity of 100% foreign ownership of a business. Yet by 2014 the leading five insurers, namely Gulf Insurance Group, Kuwait Insurance Company, Warba Insurance Company, Al Ahleia Insurance Company, and Boubyan Takaful Insurance Company, sat on a combined 63% market share. The remaining smaller players were thus making do with an average premium per insurer of USD13 million.</p><h4>...But No Consolidation So Far</h4><p>Moody's noted, too, that Ministry of Commerce and Industry policy to bolster insurers' capitalization by hiking core capital requirements in 2011 to KWD10 million (USD33.1 million) for composite insurers and KWD15 million for reinsurers did curb the entry of new players to some extent, but failed to see smaller existing players hang up their hats, or opt for consolidation. Furthermore, these players are also owned by large liquid businesses, and as such continue to swim the same familiar pond, rather than diversify by product or geography. Indeed, GPW is 80% comprised of non-life policies, chiefly from the motor branch. And so the only partial success of changes made since 2011 to prevailing insurance law, dating back to 1961, prompts the need for...</p><h4>...Differentiation</h4><p>Tareq A. Wahab Al Sahhaf is the CEO Gulf Insurance &amp; Reinsurance Company (GIRI), which, established in 2007, is the largest insurance firm by written and retained premiums. He explained to TBY the steps taken to hone human resources and leverage ICT to make precisesly such a difference. The results, he argued, were clear. “Having been upgraded from A- to A by A.M. Best, GIRI is now the fourth insurance company in the Arab world to obtain such a rating.“ Furthermore, being a part of Gulf Insurance Group (GIG), a diversified insurance group operating in the Middle East and North Africa, “we can always leverage our sister companies in Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Algeria, and Turkey.“</p><h4>Regulation-The Virtue of Checks and Balances</h4><p>The government has been petitioned to provide an independent industry regulator, staffed by those, professionally speaking, in the know, in the interests of realizing larger plans for Kuwait's financial universe. GIRI's Al Sahhaf adds that “You simply cannot install a regulator that does not have a background in insurance.“ Moreover, with the right oversight, “(the) regulator would be able to impose ratings for companies, as well as solvency margins, capital adequacy, reserving, and actuarial studies, (paving the way for) products that cannot be sold in the market without approval by the regulator.“ Those calling for such a regulator talk of the lack of reliable sector data needed to analyze market trends and draft strategy, where results, collected quarterly, appear up to a year later. They argue that only then could the sector gradually shift away from margin-eroding price competition. In their defense, they cite the regional and local measures taken to foster a leaner and more robust industry, such as the 2015 doubling of minimum capital requirements in Oman and stiffer liquid asset requirements in Kuwait and the UAE. Yet, in October 2016 Kuwait's Ministry of Commerce and Industry decided not to appoint a separate insurance industry watchdog, although adjustments would follow subsequent developments in the industry. The country is in the throes of public spending austerity, and this need to slim down a vast state apparatus could in part have been behind the decision.</p><h4>Tank Half Takaful</h4><p>Al Sahhaf points out that these players, again, are also competing with conventional companies with one perceived advantage. “When it comes to the takaful license, it is better than the traditional one, as a takaful license allows for both (activities).“ Accordingly, “GIRI is labelled a conventional insurer, but Islamic insurers can cover both conventional and Islamic businesses. They are not supposed to, but this happens.“ Yet their performance, regardless of this would-be head start, is limited by their obligation to distribute excess profits to policy holders, rather than turning profits like conventional counterparts. Where a deficit is experienced, takaful entities end up funding payments via interest-free loans, with shareholders taking the brunt of the loss. Ultimately, too, takaful players, while increasingly sophisticated, have fewer products green-lighted by sharia rulings, and therefore rely heavily on deposits at the central bank, curbing innovation.</p><p>By way of a conclusion, we may look to the 2017 prognosis of the Middle East Insurance Review. It, too, notes that regional economic reform in support of diversification will reduce business concentration in the insurance sector. Indeed, as the economy chapter reveals, Kuwait is working to stimulate its SMEs, which will eventually require more diverse coverage given sufficient awareness and incentive. And, meanwhile, global security concerns are seeing businesses across all sectors working to protect themselves against all eventualities, such as cancelled contracts or instability. Those same concerns, and the realities of price competition, too, are bringing risk management into sharper relief among the insurers themselves. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Insurance","oversight-spells-underwriting","1460","552ef2b0361618126878404e","552ef2b03616181268784057","Middle East > Kuwait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
