		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities does the South Pars gas field offer?</h4><p>The Iranian part of the South Pars field encompasses almost 14 trillion cubic meters (tcm) of gas (which measures some 500 trillion cubic feet [tcf]). It is a very rich field. There is a large portion of condensate, with some 18 billion barrels of condensate in the reservoir. Also, 1.5% of the gas comprises ethane, which is of great significance to petrochemicals, and we have a good portion of C3-C4, which makes it rich in terms of LPG as well. It is a sour gas with 5,000 parts per million (ppm) of sulfur content. Iran's strategy has been to develop the field, as we are in need of the gas and we can export it in the form of LNG. On the other hand, the Qatari part of the field is developing very rapidly because Qatar began to develop it 10 years earlier than we did, and the migration of the gas in the Iranian field to the Qatari field was very probable due to the high pressure levels. So we started with phases located near the border. The whole area was divided into 28 phases, and each phase is expected to have a daily production of 1 billion cubic feet (BcF) of gas, 40,000 barrels of condensate, 1,500 tons of LPG per year, and 1.5 million tons of ethane per year. It presented Iran with a real opportunity to take a global role in gas and in substituting gas for other liquid products such as gasoline. That is the reason why the share of gas in our energy basket has risen to 65% from 10% in the last 30 years, and this could further increase in the future.</p><p>Iran's total production of gas measures more than 135 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, while Europe's total import requirement is about 200 bcm per year. This means that our domestic consumption rate stands very high. In the future, we believe there will be more gas exploration, as so far the exploration activities have focused on oil, and we will be able to find more gas reserves. The portion of gas in our energy basket will also increase, and hopefully our ability to export will increase simultaneously. The strategy is to divert gas production to exports, not to domestic consumption.</p><h4>Which new phases of the South Pars field are now being developed by your company? Has the financing of the new phases proved more difficult to secure?</h4><p>We are now developing Phases 12 and 19. Petropars is responsible for the financing of projects, as we have contracts within a buy-back scheme. We have experienced some critical situations in financing the new phases. Many companies were ready to cooperate with us like OMV and Statoil; however, they had to withdraw. Now we have Sonangol from Angola. We have had long and productive negotiations with ONGC from India together with another private company in India. They are making the decision on whether to participate with their government, and we are waiting for a final answer. However, we have managed to secure the financing of the projects with the support of NICO and the indirect support of NIOC, and in 2009 we accelerated our activities. We have attained 38% progress on the Phase 12 project, and within two years we will have early production from it. Phase 19, on the other hand, is a very new contract that is directly financed by NIOC, and we have only just begun work. Based on the experiences we learned during the implementation of the other phases, we are now in the process of finalizing the basic engineering.</p><div class="quote">“One of our main visions [is] to expand our activities within Iran and internationally. "</div><h4>Are Petropars's activities limited to the phases of South Pars gas field? Or is your company planning to expand its activities to other gas fields?</h4><p>No, our projects are not limited to those of South Pars, and it has been one of our main visions to expand our activities within the Islamic Republic of Iran and internationally. We already have the Kish Project, in which Petropars acts as the main operator. We have two partners in this project. This project has a buy-back scheme and the Petroleum Engineering and Development Company (PEDEC), as an affiliate company of NIOC, is acting as the client for this project.</p><p>This field is located in the Persian Gulf, in the area of Kish Island. According to estimates, this field's gas in place is approximately 48 tcf, with a recovery factor of 75%. The volume of condensate produced from this field is estimated to be 514 million barrels. We are finalizing the MDP of the project with our client, while we have started the work as the operator of the project.</p><h4>What sort of expertise has Petropars gained from all of these projects?</h4><p>Fortunately, Petropars has been capable of managing and running all these projects, and our competency lies in the upstream part of the value chain. The reservoir engineering section of the company is very competent in its field, and we are capable of carrying out everything related to geology, seismic interpretation, reservoir modeling, and calculations about the capacity of reservoirs. We also have a very qualified drilling team, and our record so far in Phase 12 has been as good as that of Statoil and other international companies.</p><h4>Did the production in previous phases meet your expectations? Were they profitable undertakings for Petropars?</h4><p>In Phases 4 and 5, the rate of return for Petropars was well below that of our foreign partner. We made a profit of $90 million. In Phases 6, 7, and 8 we split the profits with NICO, and it gained 90% of the remunerations. Out of that phase, Petropars earned a profit of only $100 million. Our expertise does not lie with the financing of the project, and we have to give much of the profit to the project's financiers and partners. Currently, the value of the company amounts to about $500 million, which is already favorable for us. Yet, it can be improved and promoted in the future. The value of our contracts is more like $20 billion and we have a turnover of $2.5 billion annually. We have to increase our fixed assets so that we can conduct our business more confidently.</p><h4>It has been a priority for Petropars to work with Iranian companies. How has this worked so far?</h4><p>Petropars has taken a leadership role for Iranian companies so that they can build their capacities in onshore and offshore activities. Offshore, especially, has been a new area for Iranian companies. Like a mother who feeds and raises her children, we also help Iranian companies to grow and develop. Maybe, therefore, some of them grew bulkier than us. This will be our future strategy as well, although there is always a contradiction between the targets of the project and this strategy. Sometimes we have to increase the duration of a project because we are working with Iranian companies. On the other hand, it is a very good investment in the future.</p><h4>In which areas do you work mostly with foreign companies?</h4><p>We work with well-known foreign companies mainly in the basic engineering processes. For example, in previous phases we worked with Foster Wheeler and Worley Parsons of the UK, and Toyo of Japan. Our engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) packages can amount up to $8 billion, and we usually offer them to consortia of local and foreign companies. International companies that have taken part in these consortia so far include Tecnimont from Italy, Daelim and Samsung from Korea, and JGC and Toyo from Japan, just to name a few. We normally buy our high-tech machinery from European and Japanese companies, such as our turbo compressors from Siemens, and for fixed equipment we collaborate with Iranian companies. We also have experts from India and Europe working with us.</p><h4>What do you do to keep expertise in the country?</h4><p>We have a very young and well-educated workforce, mainly coming from universities like Sharif and Tehran. In our company, these young professionals are provided with very good opportunities to interact with foreign experts through business tours and factory visits. We also have many applied workshops and on-the-job training courses for these young professionals. Further, we collaborate with universities for our training programs.</p><h4>You have been collaborating with Petróleos de Venezuela in the Orinoco oil belt. What is the current status of this collaboration?</h4><p>In the Orinoco oil belt, we benefit from our expertise in upstream studies. Quantification studies are ongoing in many blocks of the Ayacucho. Foreign companies also certified the results of our quantification studies. We also wanted to develop some of these regions, but the terms of the contracts were not so feasible for us. In the Dobokubi region of the Orinoco, now we are conducting feasibility studies and working on a new model of contract. We are also performing feasibility studies in Angola, Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria, all of which could easily turn into development projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Getting Ready to Liquefy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[getting-ready-to-liquefy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Iran was well known for its oil exporting capability, but when did it decide to enter into the field of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports?</h4><p>The main feasibility studies started in the early part of the new millennium, and the government decided to initiate three or four LNG projects. This had two important repercussions: First, in changing the strategy of the country from only oil and oil products to gas and gas products; and the second being the entrance of the private sector into the country's mega projects. By allowing the private sector into major areas like liquefaction and the other mega projects can make institutions powerful enough to change the strategy of the country's economy. The government never had a large enough budget for the expansion of the LNG sector, so this became a very good case study of the private sector coming in and showing its ability. The government remains a minor investor in my project, at 49% at first, but its share will fall to about 20% by 2012.</p><h4>Was it difficult to persuade the government to allow private sector participation in this industry?</h4><p>It was a challenge because everybody, including those in government, wanted to keep the best part of the economy in their hands. Nobody wanted to lose it. However, because of policies introduced some four or five years ago on the privatization of state assets, they started to think about the possibility. We don't want only Iranian private sector players but also the private sectors of other countries to come and help us make this privatization program real and efficient. We want to deliver LNG on time and make the private sector of the country more powerful.</p><h4>The oil and gas sector is dominated by state companies. When did you start the company, and how are your relationships with the other state-owned companies?</h4><p>We established our company at the end of July 2006, but the project really started in July of 2007. A year was needed for its establishment, its branches, central office, and the employment of staff. Outside Iran some international companies think that we are a state-owned company, and we have experienced some complications because of that. Inside Iran we have some problems as most of the state-owned companies hesitate because we are a private sector company.</p><div class="quote">“By allowing the private sector into major areas like liquefaction can make institutions powerful enough to change the strategy of the country's economy."</div><p>They say if we were a state-owned company they could work with us more efficiently, but because we are a private company then they are unsure as to what the policy is on working with us. So, we have a few issues to resolve, but I think that step-by-step we will find ourselves in a better position.</p><h4>So you founded the company to buy gas, liquefy it, and then export it to international customers?</h4><p>Yes, but we are buying sour gas. Usually, when you say gas you mean sweet gas, but that's not what we're buying. We are buying sour gas from the South Pars region and then liquefying it. We first purify it, make it sweet, then we liquefy it and store it, and then export it through our shipping, marine and port services companies, of which we have two. These companies are our subsidiaries.</p><h4>At what stage are you now?</h4><p>At the main plant, which is located close to Assaluyeh in Kangan, our progress is at about 38%. We had some problems because of cash flow, and this has been the main reason why we could not reach the goals of the project. We hoped to be about 54% complete by this stage. Also due to the lack of capital we had to change our policy to complete the internal projects step by step. We started the production of electricity in August. We are going to expand our power plant within a year to reach a full production capacity of about 1,100 MW. Our sweetening plant will also start production by approximately early 2012, and it will produce 56 million cubic meters of sweet gas a day. We are receiving 58 million cubic meters and exporting 52 to 53 million cubic meters a day of sweet gas to the national grid until the liquefaction projects are complete.</p><h4>And these liquefaction projects will be completed in 2012?</h4><p>Yes, in 2012 we will start the production of LNG if we receive the necessary budget from our shareholders. If we can achieve this goal, then we will send our first export cargo of liquefied natural gas in 2012.</p><h4>Did the global financial crisis also affect your plans because you have foreign investors?</h4><p>Not only because of the presence of foreign investors, but also because of their decision-making processes—they had some problems during the recession. They had to think twice about making new investments. We also experienced difficulties because of the finances of our internal shareholders, because petroleum prices were falling, and we were not able to obtain the investment we had targeted from both the government and private sector.</p><h4>When liquefaction begins, what will be your production capacity? Will you export it all?</h4><p>For the transportation of gas you have different means. If you have a pipe with a diameter of zero inches, then gas can be transported zero miles. If the diameter is 56 inches, then a maximum of 2,000 miles is logical to transport the gas by pipeline. Any more than this, and LNG is better. In the smaller diameters for pipelines, LNG is more logical for lower distances. But you can assume that for a radius of about 2,000 miles we can export the gas by pipeline. It's logical and economical. For more than this, it is better to liquefy the gas. This demonstrates that we are not going to export the LNG inside of this radius. We have to export LNG over longer distances to markets such as India, Japan, China, or Europe.</p><h4>Does Europe have a large demand for natural gas?</h4><p>Not now. The more attractive markets for us are India and China as I don't think that the countries of Europe are going to undergo big changes in terms of GDP growth. China's growth pattern means that every year it needs an additional 5 million tons. But in Europe, for example, if it needs 20 million tons this year, next year it might need 20.5 million tons or so, not much more. When we start we have to enter new markets. These markets mostly comprise India and China, although Korea and Thailand are also under consideration.</p><h4>The domestic consumption of gas is very high in Iran. Do you think this level of consumption will allow you or other companies to increase exports?</h4><p>Yes, because first I think that domestic consumption will change drastically after the lifting of subsidies. Also, production is set to increase in Iran to about 1,000 million cubic meters in the coming years (400 million cubic meters more than now) by 2015 at the latest, and this is more than enough for injection and export.</p><h4>Are you going to take all your feedstock from the South Pars region or are there other onshore fields you are looking to utilize?</h4><p>We have many onshore as well as offshore fields that have only one owner, and this owner is Iran. But when you have something like South Pars where there are only two people on either side of the table, you want to at least have your share in your hand.</p><h4>How does Iran LNG and its exports compare to other countries, like Qatar? How much do you look to export by 2015?</h4><p>With the right funding, then in no more than one year from now we can stand on our feet independently. By that time we should have six to seven trains producing about 38-40 million tons of LNG and about 3.5 million tons of LPG. I think by then we will also have trains under construction for 20-25 million tons of LNG and 20 to 30 ships as LNG carriers. We will be a company with sales revenue of about $25 billion to $28 billion per year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[competition-leads-to-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Safa Industrial Group has a long history in Iran. What are its origins?</h4><p>This is a 100% privately owned company established by my great-great grandfather. The group was first established for steel trading over 160 years ago, and I am the first generation to take the business from trade into industry. We now have 35 years of experience in the production and manufacturing business. Under Safa Industrial Group there are 22 companies, and of them five are trading companies, one is in the oil business, one is in the baby food industry, and another company produces pens. The rest of the companies in the group are related to steel. For example, they manufacture pipes and structural materials. With an annual production of 4 million tons of a variety of pipes from an outside diameter of 10 mm up to 3,000 mm, we are one of the biggest pipe manufacturers in the world and are responding to the huge demand present in the Iranian market. We employ some of the highest technology means in the global pipe industry in our manufacturing processes to ensure quality.</p><h4>What does your production focus on?</h4><p>Industrial pipes, housing structures, construction materials, the automotive industry, as well as water, gas, and oil pipelines. There are some different methods of pipe production. We started 35 years ago with structural steel sections. Pipe production started 30 years ago, and 20 years ago oil pipeline production began with an outside diameter of up to 168 mm. Ten years ago we started to produce larger diameter pipes of up to 3,000 mm in size. Iran is sitting on one of the world's biggest oil and gas fields, so we decided to move into this business. Before then all the pipes were imported, especially the large diameter pipes used in the oil and gas industry. You can easily say that 95% of the current domestic demand for oil and gas pipelines is supplied domestically by Safa Industrial Group and its local competitors. As Safa Pipe Mills, up to now we have produced some 50,000 kilometers of oil and gas pipeline. More than 80% of domestic projects in the water, gas or oil sectors belong to us. Of course, we use a different technology when producing pipes for water transportation.</p><h4>Does Safa Industrial Group export its products?</h4><p>Just over 95% of all Iranian steel pipe exports are made by our companies. We mainly export to Germany, Britain, Canada, Finland, most of Europe, Australia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, CIS countries, and Armenia. The fact that we can supply Australia with our pro-ducts should be seen as a huge success, and we have very competitive prices to compensate for the high transportation costs.</p><div class="quote">“With an annual production of 4 million tons of a variety of pipes... we are one of the biggest pipe manufacturers in the world. "</div><h4>When energy subsidies in Iran are removed are you going to be able to maintain these competitive prices?</h4><p>If you calculate all the factors and make an average price for energy then you will find that energy is not that cheap here. You must also calculate other things like labor and other costs. Energy may be cheap, but if you consider it as one of the factors and calculate the other costs, you cannot say energy is cheap. If you are comparing it to Europe, of course we are cheaper. When the energy subsidies are removed then the cost will probably become equal to Europe. The government is obliged to come up with an average cost for energy. If the energy cost itself increases, then the government is obliged to reduce the cost of other factors so as to make the average cost less than Europe in order to allow us to compete with Europe's cost base.</p><h4>Are there new markets that you are targeting for exports?</h4><p>There are some restrictions on exports. If the restrictions become smoother and easier, then we should develop our exports to new markets. That is our aim. We are currently negotiating with the government precisely over this issue.</p><h4>What is the capacity target for the new production facilities you are bringing online?</h4><p>The target is mainly to go ahead and develop our existing capacity. One of the main expansion projects we have is the Karun Rolling and Pipe Mills project, which will be the largest steel manufacturing facility in the region. We intend to produce 9.2 million tons of a variety of steel coils and plates. The coils are up to 2.2 meters in size and the plates are a width of up to 5 meters. Also in our Safa Rolling and Profile Mills Company there is an ongoing project for the production of coil and plates of a width of up to 2.2 meters. We are entering the steel production business because we were not so happy with the materials we were acquiring from other domestic producers, which are mostly state-owned companies. We will enter the market as the first major private steel producer.</p><h4>Why did you select production and manufacturing over trading? Was it to create jobs?</h4><p>My main interest was in production and manufacturing. Getting people into jobs is also a part of that. For your information, the unemployment rate of the city of Saveh is zero or as close to being zero as can be possible when compared to the rest of Iran. The reason we consider it close to zero is because of the immigrants who come to Saveh to work. We have employees from every province in Iran.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on privatization in Iran?</h4><p>Privatization in the past years was in the best interests of the government. The reason is obvious, because the government is trying to reduce its deficit and expenses. Privatization is also one of the main issues of the current government. Of course, these privatizations give a chance for competition to emerge in the market. Competition will be there, and therefore every field of business becomes more successful. If there is no competition, there is no success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When was the firm established and what was the vision behind Azar Ab Industries?</h4><p>Azar Ab was established approximately 26 years ago. Actual production began when the manufacturing equipment was installed in our factory in Arak, which was around 1986. The aim was to produce heavy equipment for industry, boilers in particular: utility boilers, industrial boilers, and package boilers.</p><p>Azar Ab also produces equipment for oil refineries, the petrochemical, cement, and steel industries, and heavy equipment for other modern industries. All these products were imported from abroad before the establishment of Azar Ab Industries. Once the company was established and our technology transfer contracts with IHI and JSW of Japan were realized, we began supplying equipment to industrial users.</p><p>So far, Azar Ab has manufactured over 200 industrial, package, and utility boilers in Iran and  abroad. At the moment, we have contracts for the construction of a complete power plant, like Bisotoun Power Plant, which is for two units of 320 MW, and Hormozgan Power Plant, which is for a 500 MW combined cycle plant. Also, we have built many more industrial boilers for petrochemical  plants. We have also supplied over 50 heat recovery steam generators for combined cycle power plants and also for refineries.</p><div class="quote">“Azar Ab has manufactured over 200 industrial, package, and utility boilers in Iran and elsewhere."</div><p>In addition, we are also active in the cement business. We have constructed cement plants on a turnkey basis for Shahrekord recently,  which was handed over to the client. We are also involved in the manufacture of hydro turbines. We have delivered over 40 hydro turbines, all of which are operational at the moment.  Azar Ab hydro turbines can produce up to 250 MW of electricity. What we have discussed so far involves the engineering, construction, and equipment manufacturing sides of our business. As far as the steel industry is concerned we have only been involved in manufacturing. However, we have supplied large-scale equipment for the steel industry, such as for the Mobarakeh and Esfahan steel plants.</p><h4>You have an interesting place in Iranian industry because you are an EPC contractor and a manufacturer of industrial equipment. Do you treat these as separate businesses or do you look for synergies when applying for projects?</h4><p>Most of our projects at the moment are on an EPC basis. For the equipment that we are manufacturing for the first time, we try to get involved in the design and engineering process as well. We are  developing  our technology when we engage in the EPC process.</p><h4></h4><h4>How do you ensure the continuous transfer of technology?</h4><p>Until recently we were in contact with our technology providers. The contract is finished, but  technology development  is continuous. We are continuing  our efforts.</p><h4>Are you still working with foreign companies and contractors?</h4><p>Yes. Before it was based on our contract. Now it is on a project basis.</p><p>You have a long-term program to update your technology to be able to compete on a global level. What are the cornerstones of this program?</p><p>Since our factory is basically designed and equipped for the production of power plant utility boilers, our main aim is to push forward this product line as our basic product. To do this, we are involved in continuously updating our technology base.</p><h4>How many people do you employ in the Arak facility currently?</h4><p>We employ 1,650 in our factory, and for the entire company you can add another 170 to that.</p><p>The production capacity of cement factories in Iran is on the rise, and has reached 100 million tons per year. Do you think the cement market has reached saturation point?</p><p>It all depends on our national economic growth rate, then there is a market for 100 million tons and more. There are many big projects in Iran that need to be implemented. Once they start, I am sure that more than 100 million tons will be required.</p><h4>There are many countries around Iran that need cement. Do you have plans to export your expertise and build cement plants there?</h4><p>We are at the moment negotiating with our neighbors for these projects and are very hopeful. In the near future, once our negotiations are complete, we will build cement plants for our neighbors. We have been discussing this possibility with Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Perhaps we will talk with Azerbaijan in the next phase.</p><h4>Have you ever built a cement plant outside of Iran?</h4><p>No. We have manufactured and supplied equipment to customers outside of Iran, but we supplied it through another contractor. Also a company that is involved with the implementation of cement plants has installed Azar Ab equipment in Syria.</p><h4>Are there any new projects on the hydro-electric side of the business?</h4><p>We have a project called Saimareh, which is named after a river, and we are working on a hydro-electric plant there. There is another project for which engineering work is being done now. Maybe some of the manufacturing will be done through Azar Ab.</p><h4>What do you think your expertise is in oil, gas, and petrochemicals?</h4><p>Our know-how is in the manufacturing of equipment for the power, oil and gas industry, the specialized equipment that is needed, is unique in the region, as is our qualified workforce. Most of our workforce was trained in Japan or by our Japanese partners IHI, in particular our engineering staff. We also have a technical cooperation agreement with FW of Spain.</p><p>Which major projects have you been involved in?</p><p>We just finished the supply of our equipment to  Marun Petrochemical Company, where we supplied the utility units. In the petrochemical industry, we have supplied equipment that we specialize in, such as boilers and utility units. Now we are also supplying the Lorestan Petrochemical Plant, the Kurdistan Petrochemical Plant, and the Mahabad Petrochemical Plant.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest opportunity for expansion in the future?</h4><p>Our company is involved in equipment that is needed in the petrochemical, oil, and hydro-power business. We are well equipped to supply this equipment because we have specialized equipment for all of these areas. If demand picks up in any of these industries, we are able to respond. Our major turnover base is going to be power plants, and this is our aim.</p><h4>Do you have plans to expand your production?</h4><p>Yes. We are in the process of expanding our factory in Assaluyeh. The plant will be operational in 20 months and we will then be able to expand our exports to other countries. When we get a location closer to port facilities we will be in a better position to export worldwide. We have big plans. First we want to focus on the region, and then on the whole world. Azar Ab is the largest producer by far of boilers and heavy equipment in Iran. There is no other company like Azar Ab in Iran that combines engineering, design, and fabrication of a variety of boilers and specialized and unique equipment. Moreover, the government does not allow any power plant to waste energy anymore, and all of the plants will become combined cycle. This means more business for us, so we have to expand production.</p><h4>Are you a private or public company?</h4><p>We are a private company. In the beginning it was public. We were privatized about six  years ago.</p><h4>What was the effect of being privatized?</h4><p>In a private company, the level of efficiency is much higher. Projects are treated in a more efficient way. When you are a government company you are not experiencing the full force of the market. Therefore, your projects, jobs, and marketing are easier. You get a lot of government jobs and so the marketing is not so rigorous. Once you are private you need to be much more vigorous because your finances depend on it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sort of products does Marun Petrochemical offer to its clients?</h4><p>It's currently one of the biggest petrochemical companies in Iran. On an annual basis we produce 1.1 million tons of ethylene, 200,000 tons of propylene, 300,000 tons of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 300,000 tons of polypropylene (PP), and 400,000 tons of monoethylene glycol (MEG). In addition to that we also have a 64% share in the Laleh Petrochemicals Company, which produces 300,000 tons of low density polyethylene (LDPE) per year. Since we have over a million tons in capacity, we are classified as a “mega olefin" company and have the second highest production capacity in Iran after Jam Petrochemical, which is actually the biggest in the world. Originally we were a state-owned company, though we were privatized about two years ago. Marun Petrochemical is now 100% privately owned.</p><h4>What effect did privatization have on the Marun Petrochemical Company?</h4><p>It's been very good. Privatization is the norm throughout the developed world, and we believe that it is also a very positive development for Iran. Privatization has brought with it many advantages. For example, the decision-making process works a lot faster. It has also enabled us to branch out and become involved in new joint ventures, such as with Bushehr Petrochemical Company (BPC), which we started to construct recently. It will be a large complex that includes olefin, polymer, MEG, and methanol plants. In addition to that, we are also involved in a joint venture in Salman-e Farsi that produces propylene from propane dehydrogenation (PDH). We also have subsidiary plants that produce PP, HDPE, and MEG. We are also branching out and looking for foreign investors, be they from the East or West, so that we can get involved in bigger projects and investments in the future.</p><h4>What do you think should be done to increase the production of petrochemicals in Iran?</h4><p>Fortunately, the conditions are good in Iran for the development of the petrochemical industry. Iranians produce most of the equipment and make up most of the workforce in the olefin plants. We have the technology, we have the raw materials, the manufacturing equipment, the chemicals and catalysts, and we have the skilled workforce. There's no reason why the petrochemical industry should not grow and expand.</p><div class="quote">“Marun is classified as a mega olefin company, since we have over one million tons in capacity."</div><h4>Do you have a sufficient worldwide network of clients for your products?</h4><p>Yes, we export to China, Europe, Turkey, India, Pakistan, and other nations. A lot of other industries have been seeking to invest in the petrochemical industry in Iran, as they realize its growth potential. We also have a lot of support from the banking sector. Credit is easily available.</p><h4>How much of what you produce is exported?</h4><p>Approximately 50%. We are also looking out for new markets, like in the Middle East and India, for example.</p><h4>Do you encounter any challenges with exports?</h4><p>We don't encounter many problems because it's a high-demand market that's not at all saturated.</p><h4>Who are your biggest competitors?</h4><p>SABIC of Saudi Arabia is our main competition.</p><h4>Are you also trying to attract foreign investments for your new ventures in Bushehr and Salman-e Farsi?</h4><p>We are open to all offers, and our evaluation criteria change according to the market. But yes, we are looking for foreign investors. However, Marun has a high capability and will go ahead with these projects with or without foreign investment. We also have local investment offers, mainly from banks. And in Bushehr we have a joint venture with SATA, the Armed Forces Pension Fund.</p><h4>To what extent do you see your production capacity increasing as the new projects in Bushehr and Salman-e Farsi are completed?</h4><p>Our joint venture in Bushehr will produce another 1 million tons of olefin. As for Salman-e Farsi, it will only produce propylene.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you think the current high demand for cars in Iran will be sustainable, especially after the removal of energy subsidies in the near future?</h4><p>Over the past 10 years, the Iranian market has experienced a rising trend in passenger car demand. In 2009, when all global manufacturers were suffering from an economic and production downturn, we experienced a 13% increase in production. We forecast that this rising trend will continue in the upcoming years. For 2021, we forecast that demand will increase to 2.3 million units for the local market in terms of passenger car and light pickup vehicles. And precisely because of this, we are actually increasing our position in the global ranks. In 2008, Iran was ranked as the 16th largest car manufacturer in the world, and in 2009 we were the 12th largest manufacturer in the world. We believe that this increasing trend will continue until 2016, while from 2016 onward we will begin to experience flatter demand in the market.</p><p>There are some factors that may speed up or slow down demand. Among them is fuel price and the removal of subsidies. We believe that this will have a short-term effect, but after that short period the growth trend will return because a vehicle is perceived to be an investment commodity in Iran, and we can maintain this status in the future. On the other hand, there will be factors that will affect demand positively, and the most important of these is the introduction of a vehicle scrappage scheme. As a large part of the Iranian local fleet is made up of older model cars, replacing these vehicles can help compensate for the flatter demand caused by higher energy prices.</p><h4>Do you have any special plans to replace old vehicles?</h4><p>Yes, there was a proposal made by the motor vehicle manufacturers and submitted to the Iranian government last year. IKCO is one of the main figures behind this proposal, which outlines for the government how much liquidity is required to perform the scrappage scheme on a yearly basis. The government and the Central Bank approved it. Based on this proposal, IKCO will be responsible for replacing 200,000 vehicles and Saipa will be responsible for replacing another 200,000 of them within one year. The government has decided on a special loan to be given to the owners of older cars, and these vehicles will be valued as well. So, based on the price, the cars will be purchased, a loan will be given, and within this scheme the owners of older model cars will increase their purchasing power, and we can implement the scheme. This loan will be at least 60% of the car price.</p><div class="quote">“When all global manufacturers were suffering from an economic and production downturn, we experienced a 13% increase in production."</div><h4>What is the current production capacity and nominal production of IKCO?</h4><p>The production capacity of IKCO is around 1 million units per year for passenger cars and light pick-up vehicles. Last year we produced 680,000 passenger cars and light pick-up units. The year before we produced 600,000 units, and for this year we plan to produce 780,000 units.</p><h4>The market share of IKCO is around 50% right now. Are you looking to maintain or increase your market share by 2015?</h4><p>Our market share from 2008 to 2009 has increased, and we have planned that by 2015 we will achieve a 55% market share. By 2015 our production volume will be around 1.4 million units. We have begun taking advantage of increased demand, and in parallel we have planned to increase our production capacity.</p><h4>What will be the focus of IKCO's strategy going forward?</h4><p>For the past 10 years, our investment has focused on increasing production capacity. But for the next 10 years our investment focus will be on the development of new products. We have already established our production capacity inside Iran, and some of these facilities are still under construction. Our production facility in Tabriz is busy with the production of pickups. In Mashhad, we have another site that produces two Suzuki and Peugeot-branded cars and one IKCO-branded car. The capacity of this site is 150,000 units per year. The site in Kermanshah will produce light commercial vehicles, and is now under construction. In September 2010 our production site in Mazandaran, in the city of Babol, was opened by the Deputy President of Iran, and it will produce luxury cars. There is another site under construction in Shiraz that will produce one IKCO model and two Peugeot models.</p><p>As IKCO, we are at a certain stage as a car producer. We started with the assembly of cars, and then we increased the localization level of the parts and components. After that, we introduced the Samand project as a national car. With this project, we learned how to design the body and trim of a car. After that, we arrived at the development and design of the power train and related components. With this project, we introduced some engines to the market that are now available and are in use in IKCO vehicles. We are now ready to produce our own cars suited to our own needs. In the next phase, we are going to design platforms. The design of national platforms is on IKCO's agenda.</p><h4>With the latest investments, IKCO is fast becoming an international company. Where are your production sites abroad and how did you decide to establish these production sites?</h4><p>Parallel to the local sites, we have established some international sites with regard to the amount of export demand we have received. Some of them are still under construction. One of the largest sites for IKCO is in Syria. It was opened in 2009 with a capacity of 30,000 units per year. We have another site in Venezuela, which was opened in a joint ceremony by President Ahmadinejad and President Chávez. In 2009, the production capacity was 25,000 units. We have another large site in Belarus, which is under construction. The capacity will be 30,000 units per year. We have another large site in Senegal. This site will be opened in the first week of November 2010 by high-ranking officials from Iran and Senegal and is set to produce 25,000 units of IKCO-branded cars annually. In all of these production sites we produce IKCO-branded cars, with the exception of in Egypt. In Egypt we have a cooperation agreement with Peugeot's representatives and produce Peugeot-branded cars.</p><h4>Does IKCO export cars from Iran to other countries?</h4><p>Six years ago, we developed plans to export our products to target markets. In 2007, we reached our highest figure, which was around 45,000 units. In 2008 and 2009, due to the global financial crisis, we saw a decrease in exports. However, for 2010 we have planned on 60,000 units for export. We will achieve this export target through two methods. One of them is the direct export of CBUs (completely built units) to export markets, and the other is the export of CKD (completely knocked down) units to our international sites. We believe that we will reach these targets since we will be introducing two new products, and we have already received strong demand for these products.</p><p>In 2015, we are looking to allocate 15% of our production to exports. One of the hindrances to foreign exports is the regulations and standards that are being introduced in these countries in the coming years. As part of our product-development investment, we have developed our products in a way that they are able to meet these new standards and regulations.</p><h4>For these product development plans, which will be the biggest part of your investments in the near future, and which international companies are you working with? Will you continue your relationships with Peugeot and Renault?</h4><p>We have worked with Peugeot for about 22 years, and Peugeot is one of IKCO's major partners. It has been about six years that we and the Saipa Company developed a joint, common-platform project with Renault of France (Logan). Based on this, we have introduced the Tondar to the Iranian market. There is another partner, Mercedes-Benz, with which we have been working for about 30 years, specifically in the commercial segment, for buses and trucks. We have another company called Iran Khodro Diesel, which is responsible for the production of IKCO's commercial vehicles. In Iran Khodro Diesel, we have established a 30,000 unit capacity for the production of commercial vehicles. We have another Japanese company as a partner, Suzuki, with which we have recently started to work. We have plans to develop our cooperation with Suzuki in the coming years.</p><h4>What percentage of auto parts is produced locally?</h4><p>The localization rate depends on the product. For three products, Peugeot Pars, Peugeot 405, and Samand, the localization rate is almost 100%. For the Peugeot 206, we have achieved 60% localization. There is another product in development phase called the Runna. This will be introduced in the C-segment of the market. The price will be between $10,000 and $12,000. This will be introduced under the IKCO brand, and we have targeted 100% localization at the time of its introduction to the market. The Runna will be engineered, developed, and designed by Iranian engineers. Based on the lessons we learned from the Samand as a national car, and the technologies that we achieved and received, we plan to develop and introduce the Runna as the second brand for IKCO. One of our major targets for developing the Runna was exports, so that we are able to produce the Runna beside the Samand at our international sites.</p><h4>Iran aims to improve its public transportation system, which means that the country will need more new buses. Does IKCO have any plans to address this demand?</h4><p>Yes, one of the important plans of Iran Khodro Diesel is to increase the production capacity of its bus and minibus production lines. In 2009, we experienced a 10% increase in production of Iran Khodro Diesel. However, the demand for public transport vehicles in Iran exceeds that of the capacity of local manufacturers. In order to be able to decrease the level of imports in this segment, just as in the passenger car segment, we have increased the local content of our commercial segment. For example, for some heavy-duty trucks, more than 70% is localized and we are developing a national project called the National Bus in order to meet market demand. We expect to introduce the National Bus by the end of 2011.</p><h4>What about the environmental pollution issue in Iran. Do you have any plans to improve emission standards?</h4><p>Yes, this is one of the important points that we have taken into account. In Iran, vehicle manufacturers are obliged to meet Euro 2 and Euro 3 standards. In 2012, all manufacturers should meet the Euro 4 standard. In line with this requirement, we have plans to develop our engines in a way to be able to meet such standards by 2012. Besides the pollution issue, fuel consumption is also very important for us because of the increasing price of petrol. We have developed many plans to make our engines more energy efficient. We have developed plans to develop hybrid and electric vehicles using IKCO engines, and we have defined some projects in this regard. As you know, we have large gas reserves in Iran, and because of this we developed plans six years ago to introduce compressed natural gas (CNG)-capable products. Currently, 50% of the production of IKCO is capable of using CNG as a source of fuel. We have set a 70% target for next year. Taking into account the news about the increasing price of gasoline, we have seen that in the past few months there has been a sharp increase in demand for CNG-capable products in the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Solico Group become one of Iran's largest agro-industrial producers?</h4><p>In 1976 I started in distribution with processed meat products that were locally made. Then in 1977 I opened up my own facilities for the production of hamburgers. Since then I have become famous as “the one factory a year entrepreneur".</p><p>I started in 1979 with my first sausage and processed meat factory in Shiraz under the Demes trading name. Later in 1980 I opened a second plant in Tehran under the name of Solico Tehran. In 1982, I began Almol Meat, another processed meat company.</p><p>In 1983, I branched out into fish products, and opened a plant in Bushehr that produced fish filets, deboned fish, fish sausages, fish fingers, and tuna fish. At that time, the level of domestic meat production in Iran was not sufficient to satisfy national demand. In 1984, I started another meat processing company in the city of Bushehr. Then, in 1985, I diversified into licorice, starting up a company called Aser in this field. In 1986 we diversified yet again into synthetic casings for sausages. By 1987 I was exporting natural casings to Europe. At the same time I was also exporting carpets. In 1988 I was exporting Salambur (sheep leather), to Italy. In 1990, I started a new meat factory in Kermanshah, in the west of Iran.</p><div class="quote">“We are continuously adding more machines to our lines to meet our sales targets..."</div><h4>Kalleh Dairy is one of the biggest producers of dairy products in Iran. Where did your interest in the dairy industry come from?</h4><p>I started in the dairy industry in 1990 with just 3 liters of milk. I began by collecting milk from farmers through collection centers that I introduced. Then I began selling milk as a raw material on a pilot-scale production level, starting with yogurt, cheese, and ice cream.</p><p>The reason I originally went to Bushehr, starting with fish products, was because of the insufficient level of domestic meat production in the country. I wanted to introduce fish products as a substitute to red meat, but it was not very successful because at that time most people preferred red meat over other products such as fish.</p><p>In that period, during the 1990s, there were insufficient numbers of sheep and cattle in the country. I was importing beef then, which was mostly used in my processed meat companies, but again there was an insufficient supply of red meat in the market, and that's why I diversified into fish and seafood products, as a nutritious substitute product for red meat. But the market acceptance for fish products was low, and there was little demand. One major problem was the geographical habits, tastes and food preferences of the people. Obviously, the demand for fish products was mostly found in regions close to the sea, where there was a stronger preference for fish, though in all other areas of the country the people showed a much stronger preference for red meat like lamb and beef.</p><p>So I came to a decision: I should pay a lot more attention to the red meat sector of the economy and improve the incentives for farmers to raise more cattle. That's why I started in dairy, in order to make sure that farmers were induced to invest more in raising cattle and have a secure source to sell their milk, as well as send their animals to slaughterhouses, and so incentives were provided. The milk they produced was bought in any quantity that they produced it in, so the farmers were encouraged to produce more and more. Consequently, the production of milk and beef both increased considerably, as non-milking cattle were sent to the slaughterhouses for processing. Therefore, this planned approach made me become more self-sufficient in my raw material requirements, and I was also freely procuring the beef that I needed for the Group's meat processing companies. Both dairy and processed meat production are complementary in terms of industry, and their raw material requirements come from the same source, which is cattle. Now you can see why I entered the dairy industry.</p><h4>How many dairy products are your facilities capable of producing?</h4><p>For cheese, we produce something between 130 tons and 150 tons on a daily basis, and the projection for the coming Iranian New Year is 200 tons per day. For yogurt, our production capacity is 400 tons but our actual sales are 800 tons. Right now I am outsourcing most of the production to private label producers.</p><h4>Are your facilities working at full capacity?</h4><p>Including our outsourced production, maybe more than that. We are continually adding more machines to our lines to meet our sales targets and reduce the quantity of private label products. For dairy drinks, our actual production volume is 300 tons, and after the installation of a new line in the next 6 months we will surpass the 700 ton mark. We produce a broad range of UHT products, flavored milk, cream, and desserts. We are also involved in the sale of condensed powder milk, and we import large quantities of butter—1,000 to 2,000 tons per month.</p><h4>As the market leader in dairy products, how are you distributing your products to smaller, regional locations?</h4><p>We have 20 centers throughout Iran providing direct sales to retail shops and supermarkets. They provide services to 45,000 retail shops throughout Iran, and are visited on frequencies of one to six times per week, according to their classification. Our future expansion plans include increasing the number of distribution centers to 32 in Iran.</p><h4>What is the size of your company, and in which areas are you focused on producing?</h4><p>We have about 6,200 employees spread across the Group's companies, and are  involved in dairy, ice cream, meat processing, packaging, and non-dairy beverages like juices and alcohol-free beers. We have a daily turnover of $1.4 million to $2 million.</p><p>In dairy, we're producing 1 million liters per day, although our plan is to increase this to 2 million liters. This is the planned target for the production plant that we have in the city of Amol in the north of Iran. We are opening a second plant in nearby Tehran. We're also thinking of opening a third plant, though haven't come to a decision yet on where to locate it.</p><p>We have two ice cream plants. The second is still under construction and production hasn't started. Current daily production is about 80 tons, and we are looking to increase our projected sales to 300 tons. In addition to ice cream, it will produce chocolate and frozen pastries.</p><p>In the meat sector, we are currently allocating 100 tons of raw materials, and we are looking to reach 300 tons in our forecasts. A meat processing plant is under construction, and machinery is being procured. The range of products to be produced includes meat cuts, frozen ready-to-eat meals, sausages, salamis, and many others.</p><p>We are also in beverages, sauces and dressings. We produce juices and non-alcoholic beer, which is a new field of the industry for us. Our daily production for sauces is somewhere between 15 and 20 tons. With the new production facilities the production volume should reach 100 tons per day. We are in packaging as well, producing cups and containers, prints, and also casings.</p><h4>How has the Iranian market changed since you first went into the dairy business?</h4><p>The infrastructure of the country is changing rapidly. Before, those who lived in the city received their milk and dairy needs from the villages. Now it is changing, with the cities providing the villages with their dairy requirements.</p><p>Consumer trends and expectations are also changing. We see there is an increasing demand for manufactured products of higher hygienic standards. I visited a village with 400 families in the northeast of Iran, and astonishingly enough there were a number of little corner shops selling our branded dairy products. Equally, as the urban population is increasing, you will see rising demand for processed food products.</p><h4>What do you export mostly, and to which countries?</h4><p>Our sister company in the group for exports is called TOP, which stands for Trading Organization Premium. We export large volumes of assorted products to Iraq and our target is to increase our export sales to even higher volumes. We do direct sales and distribution in Kurdistan, Karbala, Najaf, Rahdod, and Basra, and we are also active in other parts of that country. We have joint-venture companies in a number of countries including the UAE, the Far East, and Afghanistan. We are planning to reach a marketplace of 300 million people in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the opportunity you managed to identify in 1977 that led you down the path of heading up one of Iran's largest processed food manufacturers?</h4><p>I wanted to get away from the contractual work that I used to do and play a very different game. We started our business from our own 12 square meter kitchen with the help of my wife and family. I was distributing these products with one small car and my own two hands to nearby grocery stores. If you flash forward 35 years, I now have over 1,500 workers involved in preparing Behrouz food products. And if you include the other people who are related to our business it might amount to 10,000 in total, including all the distributors, contractors, and farmers. There are six plants that either belong to me or work under license with Behrouz Foods in Mashhad, Mino near Bandar Abbas, Shiraz, and Karaj. There are six plants strategically placed in different parts of the country, central, south, north, and I am currently in negotiations to acquire two more manufacturing facilities.</p><p>Just think, in 1977 we started out with 11 people at the time from my kitchen who were helping us to produce these homemade food products and the Olivieh salad. Now I have 40,000 customers affiliated with Behrouz Food Industries and the distribution of its products. We have 20,000 stores, supermarkets and wholesalers in Tehran and another 20,000 in different provinces around Iran.</p><h4>Did you ever expect to get this large in the food business?</h4><p>Seriously, when I started out in the food industry I wanted to be the number one food and condiments manufacturer and distributor in Iran. That was my first goal. The growth of Behrouz in terms of its physical development is a product of my mind's development. I first develop an idea in my mind and then I put it into practice. At the moment our production capacity is 30,000 tons per year for canned foods. I am in negotiations with local producers and I am currently attracting cooperation to obtain the raw materials, investors, and technology needed so I can double this output to 60,000 tons.</p><div class="quote">“People definitely like variety... the product should first visually please the consumer."</div><p>At the moment, we are working at just 60 to 70% of our production capacity. There are numerous reasons for this, including financial ones, though the raw material supply issue is the main concern that we have to deal with in Iran. We need to better manage issues such as planting, cultivating, cropping, and harvesting, as well as the transportation of fresh produce to our facilities for processing. We cannot actually train the farmers, it is out of our hands. However, the overall management of plantations, harvesting, planning for transportation and the like all need to be improved by state organizations.</p><p>I have two research centers that assist in developing the food industry in Iran: one for food production and another for the improvement of agricultural production. They are the top research centers of their type in the country and I share my research with farmers about how to improve their farming and cultivation methods.</p><h4>How much of a role does packaging play in consumer decision-making?</h4><p>People definitely like variety. From my point of view, the product should first visually please the consumer. So the role of attractive packaging in regards to the sales of the product is very vital, like water for living. As a producer you should never think that the last touch you gave to your packaging was the last modification. You have to always modify and adapt to try and please the eyes of the consumers.</p><h4>What changes do you expect to see in the agro-industry business as a whole?</h4><p>Iran started off with 300 factories prior to the Revolution, and now it has 10,000 because there was a need for development. Let me tell you about the future. In terms of figures we might see a reduction in the number of facilities in the future, but the new generation of factories will utilize larger machinery and more technology and this will increase productivity.</p><p>A merging of small factories, as happened in Europe where companies merged together, is likely to occur. After all, the future's slogan is “Technology and Mass Production with Quality". The existence of many of these small factories was a policy of the past. The new policy requires the merging of these factories, higher quality, and improved mass production techniques.</p><h4>What is your market share, and in what sector do you want to move into next?</h4><p>In the mayonnaise sector I am one of two largest producers, while in canned foods I am one of the top three producers. Overall, I am one of the top-five processed food producers in Iran. I am always looking for new opportunities, and my colleagues at other companies might be a little afraid of this development if we manage to secure the right investors. We have done a lot of research on the market and into consumer behavior that we are going to utilize to improve the company's market share in the near future.</p><p>The thing for me is that the culture of cultivation should be institutionalized in Iran. It hasn't been as yet, and this is primarily due to the inexperienced management of the agricultural sector in Iran. For a start, we should not be cultivating crops in urban areas. We have to designate special regions to certain food products with the optimal conditions for those products, as was practiced in the past. Unfortunately, in Iran important factors such as climate, water, crop type, and method of cultivation are usually not considered.</p><h4>So you believe Iran needs better planning and management in its agriculture sector?</h4><p>That's right. Other countries are enjoying the benefits of such practices. We have to think globally and act locally, the way other countries are doing, actually.</p><h4>What led you into entering the processed foods industry?</h4><p>Before establishing Behrouz Food Industries, I lived two different periods in my life. At first I was a teacher at high school. I taught mathematics, literature, and Farsi literature, and then I became the headmaster of the school. After a while I gave up my teaching career and joined the steel industry in Esfahan. It was interesting at that time because I was teaching in the morning and studying at university in the evenings. I attended courses in management and public relations, and eventually obtained my business management degree. For a while I was a building contractor and I helped to establish 19 sugar production factories.</p><p>I am one of those who have had experienced many ups and downs in my life. I started making an Iranian salad called Olivieh and then I started the real business as it is known today, Behrouz Food Industries, by making this type of salad and other homemade food products and distributing them to small grocery stores in and around Tehran.</p><h4>You have also been made an ambassador for UNICEF?</h4><p>Yes, Behrouz Food Industries has had a long-standing relationship with UNICEF and was actually the first private company in Iran to partner with the organization.</p><p>UNICEF approached me as they wanted to choose an ambassador from the private sector and I was fortunate to be selected for the position. Our cooperation with UNICEF includes helping displaced Afghan children and development work in the southern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, as well as in West Azerbaijan and Hormozgan.</p><p>Before establishing Behrouz Food Industries, I lived two different periods in my life.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>HEPCO has become one of Iran's main producers of heavy road and mining machinery. What is the story behind its success?</h4><p>HEPCO was established in 1972 in Central (Markazi) Province to produce mining machinery so as to help develop mining activities in the area. HEPCO's first partner was International Harvester of the US for the assembly of mining dozers, and then we partnered with Japan's Sakai, Sweden's Dynapac for rollers, and Poclain of France for the assembly of excavators. To achieve this, the 40,000 square meter HEPCO plant in Arak was equipped with two large assembly halls and parts warehouses. The partners we worked with helped HEPCO improve the technical training of our staff to upgrade aspects of our business such as with the assembly lines, overall quality control, and after sales service.</p><p>After the Islamic Revolution, HEPCO increased its production area to 60,000 square meters in line with transfer technology agreements involving steel parts manufacturers. In 1991 HEPCO, assisted by Liebherr of Germany, for the first time established a plant to manufacture a variety of spare parts. It included different sections such as cutting, welding, milling, light and heavy die making, and running a computerized and comprehensive quality control system for the production line. Liebherr also participated in the technical training of our staff. At first, the plant produced steel parts for dozers, Liebherr excavators, and then, the light and heavy parts of Volvo loaders. Three years later, we underwent management quality system reviews and we received ISO standards for our attention to production, design, and the environment. These are still being updated and developed for staff to improve the processes and information systems of the company.</p><p>In 2003, 40% of HEPCO's stock was sold off in an IPO on the stock exchange, while the rest of the company's shares were transferred to the private sector in 2006. At present, HEPCO enjoys the largest share in the production, supply, and support of the heavy machinery sector in Iran. This in turn covers a great variety of products that are used in road construction, mining, and agriculture.</p><div class="quote">“HEPCO enjoys the largest share in the production, supply, and support of the heavy machinery sector in Iran."</div><h4>Does this mean that international brands grant HEPCO production licenses and then you go ahead with the production here?</h4><p>This is our repeated practical experience with a number of brands. At HEPCO, one of our main principles is that we are active partners in technology transfer agreements. This principle has transformed HEPCO into a premium company in the Middle East that has some of the best technical staff, modern equipment, and technology that rival even the largest of our competitors regionally. Our company strategy has led HEPCO into the fields of design and production, while still maintaining high purchase levels of other products from the main international suppliers. We also have won, on the one side, the loyalty of our current partners and, on the other side, the willingness of other international brands to initiate cooperation agreements with HEPCO for the production and after sales service of heavy machinery throughout the region.</p><h4>What are your main product lines and what is your production capacity?</h4><p>We are now producing and supporting seven types of rollers, five types of hydraulic excavators, one type of motor grader, three types of loaders in road construction, two types of heavy loaders, one type of heavy dozer, two types of dump trucks, three types of heavy hydraulic excavators in mining handling and transport, one type of backhoe loader, one type of skid steer loader in municipality services, one type of heavy tractor, and finally one heavy combine in agriculture. This means that HEPCO has the capacity to plan 20 different machinery models and simultaneously produce 2,400 units per year.</p><h4>The Agriculture Ministry wants to up the level of mechanization in agriculture in the coming five years. Will HEPCO be heavily involved in producing the machinery needed to achieve this goal?</h4><p>The plan to increase the level of mechanization has become a must of late, especially following the widespread drought that affected the rural sector in recent years. HEPCO is planning to take a strong presence in this movement while accessing development assistance from the great international brands we work with and our own experienced production and after sales service staff. In addition, HEPCO is planning on providing extensive spare parts support and we will also help train our customers in the correct operation of the machines we produce and sell.</p><h4>Has HEPCO maintained its roots in the mining and road construction industry?</h4><p>Our client list includes many big companies that are actively engaged in road construction and mining. These customers are well enough financed to not have to rely on the banking sector for credits to purchase our machinery as they have strong fixed capital levels and are able to sign significant contracts. Here at HEPCO, we are looking to establish a leasing company to supply a part of the credits needed by some of the smaller players in the industry, as we see such customers as playing an important role in HEPCO's future sales as well.</p><h4>How is HEPCO dealing with its competitors as a private company?</h4><p>Prior to the privatization of the company, the government's strategy in the past was to protect local manufacturers so that they could increase their own capabilities. This forced competitors who produced the same products as HEPCO to leave the field as they were only allowed to manufacture or sell products that HEPCO did not produce. However, as HEPCO has now become a private company, the picture has changed considerably. International companies have begun importing many types of light and heavy machinery into Iran through their sales and representative offices here. This, in turn, has reduced our market share in some of the products we produce. Our main competitors are those companies that have cooperation agreements with HEPCO and also distribute machinery directly. It should be noted that these agreements only cover those products that are produced by HEPCO. However, there are some companies that share the production of some products with HEPCO and sell them on the local market. Of course, the cost of the locally made product is much less than the imported version.</p><h4>Have Chinese companies also made their presence felt in the Iranian market?</h4><p>Chinese companies are widespread in Iran only for light loaders. These are mostly sold to less well-capitalized customers that are engaged in small-sized road construction projects and municipality services. These are not necessarily our target customers at HEPCO. However, they have attracted some of our smaller customers. The fact is that importers are just looking for higher profits without studying the market, understanding the technical capabilities of Chinese products, or respecting their customers. This has caused many customers to turn away from our competitors and back to HEPCO.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the market for light and heavy machinery in 2009, and how is HEPCO reflecting the overall trend?</h4><p>The global recession has affected the major manufacturers around the world, though in Asia Iran was the least affected. The global crisis arrived at HEPCO's door late in the picture. The operational income of HEPCO in 2008 and 2009 did not change significantly, though the crisis was felt in 2010 when we were running operations at only 45% of nominal capacity. Due to its capabilities in production and engineering, HEPCO is able to weather the storm, and is utilizing its unused capacity by producing industrial equipment and heavy machinery for power plants.</p><h4>Have you exported machinery or services to other countries?</h4><p>In recent years, HEPCO has been busy with the local market so there has been no drastic need to engage in exports. Only a small share of our production has been devoted to exports to regional countries like Afghanistan and some parts of the CIS. However, as local demand weakened, HEPCO has been active in looking to export to the region over the 2010/2011 period.</p><h4>How much  do you allocate to R&amp;D and what have you gained so far?</h4><p>HEPCO's research and development activities fall in three scopes: studying the market, improving products, and upgrading quality management systems. These activities enjoy 3% of the company's annual budget.</p><p>The research department collects customer views on the advantages and disadvantages of our products. This, in turn, has led to a steady improvement in the quality of HEPCO products. Based on this, to our customers, some of HEPCO's products such as its motor graders and rollers can compete with those of other well-known global brands. It may be interesting for the readers to know that our staff in our research and engineering sections can handle quality and production improvement on 10 products simultaneously. This is rare in the region.</p><h4>What is HEPCO's strategy to expand its cooperation with its foreign partners?</h4><p>The long-term business relationships between HEPCO and its partners as well as the mutual interests that have developed show how well our strategies have functioned in the past. HEPCO selects its partners based on win-win conditions. We are ready to hand over some parts of our market to a foreign partner, but they are expected to respect the Iranian customer's right to select the parts, products, and services they require. As HEPCO's 'capabilities increase, new collaboration projects with foreign partners will be developed. Among them, one may refer to supply and distribution of services, spare parts supply, and comprehensive training in Iran and throughout the region. HEPCO can help provide many opportunities for those who are looking for business cooperation in Iran.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-tci-way]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When was the TCI's monopoly on telecommunications ended, and how has the competitive environment evolved ever since?<br></h4><p>Seven years ago, according to legislation passed by the Parliament, other companies were permitted to engage in telecommunications activities. The largest of these is MTN Irancell. Since four years ago, according to the orders of the Supreme Leader, the privatization of TCI was put on the agenda. And so three years ago TCI launched an IPO on the stock exchange.</p><h4>And this was the biggest privatization known in the history of the country?</h4><p>I think so. Until nine months ago, just 10% of that was on the exchange and the remainder belonged to the government. In the last nine months, a 50% managing share has been sold off. The company is managed privately at present. Some 51% belongs to one private shareholder, another 30% is listed on the stock exchange, and the remaining 20% is still owned by the state, but the government does not have any say in the company's management.</p><h4>What has changed since the privatization of the company?</h4><p>The government laws were removed. Now we do not face any limits on providing services to people. We can now engage freely in the expansion of our services.</p><h4>Fixed-line penetration levels have increased in the last four years from 22 to 34%. Is there still room for growth?</h4><p>Yes, there is. There is room for growth all over the country. As the country is moving forward, there are more buildings, new companies, and new houses that need new subscriptions.</p><div class="quote">“TBY talks to Saber Faizi, Managing Director and Member of the Board of the Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI)."</div><h4>Does the government have any plans to open up fixed-line services to competition?</h4><p>Currently, there are another six companies that provide fixed-line services. These are all regional companies, not national companies, and they are private. However, we still provide 90% of fixed-line services in Iran.</p><h4>How many people currently use mobile phones in Iran?</h4><p>According to the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, 72% of people use mobile phones. We think that the market is not completely saturated and there is still room for growth. The market is very competitive. There is already a high level of competition between us and MTN Irancell, and there will be a third operator soon called Tamin Telecom.</p><h4>Do you provide both pre-paid and postpaid services for mobile phones?</h4><p>Yes, both of them are provided. We cannot talk about a specific trend in the sector, it is 50-50. We have a market share of more than 60% of the mobile phone segment.</p><h4>Is there room for new mobile competitors?</h4><p>Yes, there will be. Even though the competition is tough, new service providers would be interested in the market as it is open and free. Any foreign company can come in and participate.</p><h4>Are you going to utilize 3G technology?</h4><p>Currently, only Tamin Telecom, which is the third operator, has a license to provide 3G services in Iran. We will have permission to activate our 3G services two years after the third operator comes into the market, and we are preparing for these investments.</p><h4>Are there plans to build new infrastructure so you can provide improved regional coverage? Can you currently provide mobile internet all over the country?</h4><p>We can currently provide mobile services in all parts of the country. However, because of continuous technological advances we always need more infrastructure, but for the current technologies we do not have any worries. About the quality of services, the network is on the verge of renovation and improvement. We are working on providing better services for our clients. We mostly contract with foreign companies that cooperate with domestic Iranian companies to improve our service quality.</p><h4>Does TCI also manufacture the materials it uses in its infrastructure, like fiber cables?</h4><p>In Iran, we have six factories that manufacture fiber optics and related equipment. The companies are private, and they do not belong to us. Six companies provide us with such cables and equipment. Before privatization they were sold to personal owners.</p><h4>What about the prices of communication services in Iran, how do they compare internationally?</h4><p>In some countries, like in Turkey, people pay very high taxes to receive telecommunication services. If you omit the taxes in Turkey, the prices in Iran would be equal to those in Turkey. The tax ratio is only 5% in Iran. So, we have very competitive prices by international comparison.</p><h4>And you also began to export technical and engineering services as TCI to other countries. How are you engaged in these services?</h4><p>Most neighboring countries and their companies are allied with our engineers, who have been there. You can find experts from Iran in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey—in all the neighboring countries.</p><h4>What are the challenges to increase the quality and quantity of telecommunications services in Iran?</h4><p>Before privatization we only had government limitations, but afterwards we were free and could provide a greater variety of services. In another year service quality will reach a good point for subscribers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Did people have difficulties accepting your desire to join the transport sector?</h4><p>Not about the rules, the government and the rules did not stop me. It was the attitude of the people. They could not accept what was going on when a woman worked in a type of job that was traditionally done by men. It is not just Iran. All over the world in transportation they cannot accept that a woman is going to do this job. That is why I started to prove that if somebody wants to do something, it depends on their mentality, not on their gender. I started as a manager at first during the four years that I was at this job. At this time I started to show that I have the ability to have an influence on the people I work with. My education is in civil engineering. Maybe it was far from the job that I was going to start, but I thought that it is better to start there. After four years I tried to receive permission to establish a transportation company by myself. My application was refused by officials as they said it was not possible for a woman to do this type of occupation, and I said I want to prove that I can. After I approached them many times they gave me temporary permission. I passed so many exams and went to so many classes just to show that I could do this. Eventually I received one-year temporary permission, and so I started up in business. Fortunately, all of the people that worked with me during the previous four years—the drivers, clients, and the merchants—said they would like to be in business with me. During the first year I had more than 200 drivers in my hands. I had a contract with them and I showed them I can do this business.</p><h4>Did you own the trucks?</h4><p>No. Most of the drivers in Iran are the owners of the trucks, and the companies do not have enough capital to have their own trucks. That is why we contract with the drivers and they are self-owner drivers, and they have their passports in the name of the company. Then they load shipments from the main points in Iran and export cargo, as well as import cargo from other countries to Iran. Sometimes it is transit cargo that is passing through Iran. Of course, we had many difficulties getting the visas for drivers and preparing everything. But after 31 years working in this job I can say that it is a great job for women.</p><h4>Why do you say that?</h4><p>Many of the drivers leave the country for other places. It takes maybe three weeks to one month for the journey. This means  that their family needs somebody. Maybe they need somebody to work with them. Maybe they need some money or maybe they need help with some trouble. If the manager of the company is a man, of course the woman in the family will have some trouble getting in touch. As a woman, I always had a good friendship and relationship with the families of the drivers. If they have any problems they come to you. Of course, on the other hand you have many problems with your drivers in other cities and countries. For example, you may have smuggling or an accident, a short or lost shipment. Sometimes they fail, and you have to be brave, and you have to be on call all the time, like a doctor, I say. They can suddenly call you in the middle of the night with a problem. You need to be on call and solution-oriented all the time, because you have to inform and advise them on what to do.</p><div class="quote">“At this point we have so much transit cargo going via Iran because it is a north-south and east-west corridor."</div><h4>How do you select and train your drivers?</h4><p>So many drivers do not have enough education or they are unable to make the best decisions at the time. We have many classes for the drivers where we train them. They have to be trained, and they have to know the international transportation rules. We have a book and a syllabus of education we have to teach to the drivers when they are going to drive outside of Iran. Things like how to load the shipments, how to stack the pallets and boxes, how to secure shipments properly, because they have to check what is going on. If something goes wrong with a shipment in a different country, the penalty will go to the transportation company. However, if they have some training, insurance may cover some of the damages.</p><h4>How many drivers are you working with currently?</h4><p>We work with 70 or so drivers. I am not just working in the transportation of import and export shipments. Most of the time I am working with transit cargo. This means that I do not need to involve the company with so many trucks. We need inland transportation because it comes to the ports or to the borders and we load shipments on Iranian trucks for inland transportation across Iran and they unload at the other border.</p><h4>So your activity now focuses on transportation from the port to the city?</h4><p>We transport goods to border cities for re-export. As you know, at this point we have so much transit cargo going via Iran because it is a north-south and east-west corridor. Unfortunately, we are in the position that we have conflict in the neighborhood. It is unfortunate because, of course, war is not good. But as it is happening we have to make our way in the world. For example, In Iraq and Afghanistan we have so much potential to load and send shipments. That is why we shifted the position of our company to transit cargo.</p><h4>So that way you avoid problems with them coming into Iran and doing it themselves?</h4><p>We have to do as they need. It is all a part of multi-modal transportation. Sometimes you have to arrange it via road and rail. Sometimes you have to go by ship. Sometimes someone wants to send something to China. How can you send it? Of course on land we are going to carry it from Tehran to Bandar Abbas, and then from Bandar Abbas we go by sea.</p><h4>Do you have any type of tracking or GPS in your trucks to monitor their location?</h4><p>Yes, and when we want to talk to clients about the position of their cargo or when we want to inform the factory when the trucks will arrive we know where the trucks are. In the past we could call the drivers. Sometimes when the driver did not want to answer he would switch off the mobile and maybe he would lie, but with the GPS he cannot lie. Then you find that he has stopped for more than six hours. It is a problem that you can ask him about.</p><h4>What do you think about the road and transport infrastructure in Iran? Are more roads and ports needed?</h4><p>Of course. When the capacity of transportation is growing it means that you have to renew so many old roads and build new roads. You have to establish other facilities for the drivers on their way from point to point. For example, we have to build rest areas for the drivers. That is why we need some investment inland, and we need some investment from other countries.</p><h4>What about the ports? Where do you see room for progress?</h4><p>With the ports it is going to be through privatization. There are so many companies at the moment that get shipments in the ports. We have so much potential to be the hub for this area. It did not happen until now. Privatization will be very helpful. The government is going to help in this respect. I am sure that this area has good potential to grow.</p><h4>What about customs in Iran? Do you see any improvements on the horizon?</h4><p>Unfortunately there are old rules in customs at the moment. They are going to renew them. We have new rules that are going to the Parliament. I know that they will be approved.</p><h4>What will the new regulations change?</h4><p>For example, declarations at customs will get easier. If these rules are approved by Parliament, they will be closer to the rules of the WTO. Some cargo we do not have permission to bring in because of legal and cultural reasons, and some because they want to protect the production of Iranian factories. Many people tell us that when they try to import something they have difficulty with customs. There are some problems with the bureaucracy, though this is because the customs laws were made 40 years ago. They need to be updated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your company uses Iran's mineral wealth for a very special product: bitumen. How many factories do you have devoted to bitumen production?</h4><p>There are seven refineries in Iran producing bitumen, six of which belong to Pasargad Oil, separated from the mother refinery. Our six refineries are near Tehran, Shiraz, Bandar Abbas, Arak, Abadan, and Tabriz.</p><h4>Were you a public or private company when you were created?</h4><p>We were affiliated to the Welfare Ministry, which has an investment company known as Shasta. This company has investment holdings, one of which is Tamin Oil and Gas Investment. Our company, meanwhile, is managed under this division, but the system of managing our company is done in accordance with Iranian commercial law. Meanwhile, it is managed as a private company, including its supervisory board and its general assembly. The main shareholder is Shasta. Our annual turnover is $2 billion.</p><h4>Are you the sole producer of bitumen in Iran?</h4><p>No, there is another company in the country, Jey Oil, and it belongs to the Oil Pension Fund Organization.</p><div class="quote">“We have 70% of the domestic market. Internationally, we supply 57% of Iran's bitumen exports."</div><h4>Nonetheless, you have a dominant market share with six of the seven refineries.</h4><p>Yes, within Iran, we have 70% of the domestic market. Internationally, we supply 57% of Iran's bitumen exports.</p><h4>Why is bitumen an important product in Iran?</h4><p>Bitumen is one of the most important and critical materials for developing countries. In recent years, the importance of the product has grown because emerging markets in the Far East, China, Africa, and other places need it for road construction and insulation for new buildings.</p><p>Until now, no one has discovered an effective alternative to bitumen for roads. There is one new material, but its use is not widespread yet. As a result, more than 95% of the materials used in the construction of roads and the insulation of buildings are made from bitumen. This means that day-by-day the use of bitumen is growing. Moreover, in developed economies like Europe and the US there have been moves afoot to convert refineries into low fuel or no fuel. This means that they convert all the components of crude oil to light products, meaning that they have omitted producing heavy products like bitumen. They no longer produce bitumen and this means that bitumen-producing countries like Iran are well placed to take advantage of this. The super-heavy oils are found most in the Persian Gulf, as they are the most conducive for the manufacture of asphalt.</p><p>At the moment, the current production of bitumen around the world stands at 110 million tons, while in Iran, this figure stands at 4.5 million tons. However, we have a much higher capacity, and because the demand for bitumen is only going to increase, we will be able to play a much more serious role in the future.</p><p>Looking back at the export volume in Iran over the past two or three years, the total amount exported by the country in the Persian year 1386 (2Q 2007-1Q 2008) was 400,000 tons. Since the second quarter of 2010, however, it has been 1 million tons and by the end of the first quarter in 2011 it will be 2 million tons.</p><p>The price of bitumen in the Persian year 1387 (2Q 2008-1Q 2009) was $250/ton, but currently it is $415. These figures show that demand is really strong at the moment, and this means that we need to increase our production capacity. We have the capability to double our annual production capacity. Pasargad can produce about 3 million tons, while Jey Oil has 1.5 million tons of capacity.</p><h4>Do you have plans to increase capacity in the medium term?</h4><p>The goal of Pasargad Oil is to hit 4.5 million tons within five years. Meanwhile, I think Jey Oil will increase its capacity to 2 million tons. In 2010 we invested a lot, especially in export facilities—for instance in jetties, pumping systems and short tanks at the ports. This will allow us to load ships more easily. When transported as a liquid, the temperature required for bitumen is extremely hot, at 150 °C. If you want it to be cooler, you need to find an alternative, for instance transporting with steel barrels, or polybags. This is much more expensive and there are also environmental issues with the residue. As a result, we generally transport it in bulk, in which case it is very hot. We thus transport the bitumen through both bulk methods and in barrels.</p><p>We increased our barrel exports this year because some countries, especially in Africa, are far away, while transport from the port to the destination is difficult. Because of this, they prefer the bitumen to come in barrels, and they just heat it up when they want to construct the roads. We can respond to both needs actually. We have a big barrel plant in Bandar Abbas with a capacity of 3,000 tons per day.</p><h4>Is the increase in production at the moment mostly for export?</h4><p>Not necessarily, it's for both export and domestic use. In 1387 (2Q 2008-1Q 2009), 15% went for exports, while 85% was used domestically. Now, however, this has changed. This year, only 60% was for domestic use, while 40% was for export. I expect that this ratio will be 50-50 in the coming years.</p><h4>Do you need more investment to increase your production capacity?</h4><p>Companies are like organic systems—without investment they will wither and die. I think the company will receive at least $100 million in investment per year. In the last three years, we have certainly done this.</p><p>This investment has gone into storage tanks, a pumping system, a new plant in Abadan under construction, as well as new facilities that assist ships to export at Port Imam Khomeini in its oil zone.</p><h4>Where does Iran rank among other exporters of bitumen?</h4><p>We are the biggest in the Middle East, while Pasargad Oil Company is the 11th largest bitumen-exporting company in the world, according to the reports of various consultancy companies.</p><h4>Do you think more players will enter the Iranian market to produce bitumen if there is such an advantage here?</h4><p>Yes, some new players are certainly trying to enter the market, but their ability to compete with us is not so high because we have the advantage of being in close  proximity to the refineries, whereas they are not.</p><h4>Who are your main clients in the domestic market?</h4><p>The contractors of the road ministry, as well as the local municipalities, are our potential customers. In this, the contractors are private, even if the projects belong to the government. All over the world, most of this work is done by private contractors.</p><h4>Iran, too, is an important regional player, with projects in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</h4><p>Yes, some of our customers have projects in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and they buy from us. Furthermore, bitumen is sold on the Iranian Mercantile Exchange, or IME, which is composed of a domestic ring and an export ring. All of the bitumen sold here is done on the open market. Two days of the week are devoted to export sessions, while the other five days are for the domestic market.</p><h4>So the price you mentioned, is that only in Iran, or around the world as well?</h4><p>For the export market, it is all over the world. There are two magazines, Platts and Argus, and they are the reference sources for bitumen. In this region, we are the price maker as the dominant player in the market. The two reference magazines give our prices as the price of the region.</p><h4>You are now providing far more environmentally friendly bitumen, or green bitumen. Can you tell us a little bit more about that?</h4><p>Yes, we have built six emulsion plants, 49% of which belongs to us, and 51% belongs to another company. These are for producing green bitumen, but it hasn't been easy because it is difficult in terms of usage, and it has not really caught on in the domestic market. At the same time, exporting it has also been difficult because 30-40% of its weight is water. This means that when you want to export this product, the customer has to transport 30% water. Many people thus prefer to buy bitumen and then emulsify it closer to the area where it will be used.</p><h4>We heard recently from cement companies about plans to use cement on the roads. Do you see that as feasible?</h4><p>It is not a new technology; many years ago, they used cement on the roads. There are both pros and cons to the material. There are some places on highways, particularly where there is a lot of acceleration and deceleration, where cement can be useful for a kilometer or so. However, if you look at the roads overall, it is not a good idea, since it is expensive and is not so soft. When you have big swings in temperature, there can be problems. Ultimately, when you look at the market, 90% of the material is bitumen in its different forms, whether of a conventional grade, a polymer grade, emulsified grade and so on.</p><p>We, meanwhile, produce in all grades, but mostly in the conventional grades, which is common throughout the world in its 40/50, 60/70, 85/100 grades. As far as I know, only Switzerland and France uses more polymer or emulsion.</p><h4>Which countries are you most targeting for export at the moment? China?</h4><p>China perhaps less so, because it is close to Korea and Singapore, both of whose traders have good connections with the Chinese. We do our best, but it is a difficult market for us. However, for us, Kenya, the UAE, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore are important. The World Development Bank has many new projects in these countries, which ultimately helps us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main sources of cement demand in Iran? Do you see this demand profile changing in the coming 3-5 years?</h4><p>Iran has a very large young population that doubled in size over the past 30 years, and the need for rehabilitation, the establishment of new towns, infrastructure projects, and the country's ever-growing economy all account for this high level of demand. Cement consumption per capita was about 640 kilograms in 2009. We expect cement consumption will grow at the rate of about 10% per year for the next three years. We are also in pursuit of creating new areas for the use of cement. For instance, we are trying to promote asphalt cement and persuade local governments to use cement instead of bitumen on roads and pavements for construction. This new usage of cement in Iran will produce a sizable demand for our products.</p><h4>The production capacity of the Iranian cement industry is growing steadily through the entrance of private firms. What are your goals and strategies for this changing market?</h4><p>With the arrival of the new private firms, Iran's cement production capacity will increase to 89 million tons per year by 2013. It is expected that local cement consumption in that year will be about 67 million tons per year, however. The surplus is therefore planned for export to overseas markets in the region, at first, by means of effective promotion and marketing, by focusing on the development and utilization of appropriate transportation means, whether by land, sea or rail, as well as creating the relevant terminals to service these transport modes. Also, we will seek to implement a production distribution management system, assigning cement plants near the border for exports and devoting the rest to the local market.</p><p>We also aim to protect our share in the local market. One of the strategies we will follow will be through buying stakes in other companies through the Tehran Stock Exchange. Thus, as a holding company, we will preserve our market share.</p><div class="quote">“One of the strategies we will follow [is to buy] stakes in other companies through the Tehran Stock Exchange."</div><h4>FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is the largest cement producer in Iran. How would you describe its structure?</h4><p>The Social Security Organization is the main investor in the Iranian cement industry and is FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding's major shareholder through its two main holding companies. In total, there are 17 cement companies (having 18 plants) and more than 15 specialized companies related to the cement industry under the control of FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding.</p><p>Our current clinker production capacity is about 23.3 million tons per year, while its market share in August 2010 was almost 35%. The value of cement and cement products sold in 2009 reached $980 million.</p><h4>After the export restrictions, which ended recently, Iranian cement companies began regional exports. What will be the role of exports in the future for the Iranian cement industry?</h4><p>Until 2008, the demand for cement was higher than the supply, and therefore the government had to control exports, prices, and logistics. With the current expansion of the cement industry, a surplus in cement products is foreseen in the near future. Taking into account the strong demand for cement in Iran's neighbors, this surplus can be exported to these markets. Iraq, Afghanistan, countries of the CIS, and Persian Gulf states are the immediate markets, though more distant markets could also be considered.</p><h4>The government has plans to remove energy subsidies. What would be the effect of this policy on domestic producers?</h4><p>Around 40% of total costs for a world-class cement producer come from energy, while in Iran this share is about 14% of total costs thanks to the government's subsidies. It is now planning to lift this advantage gradually in three to five years. The government, of course, will help industries overcome any disadvantages they experience, by improving energy consumption, for example, through financial and technical assistance. The effect of this policy on the cement industry will mostly be on profit margins. Producers will have to work hard to minimize any potential losses by improving management, productivity, and efficiency. Producers will also need to work hard to maintain their market share both in foreign and local markets in the midst of the tough competition between the older players in the public sector and newcomers in the private sector.</p><h4>What is the role of foreign investors in your future strategy? What are you doing to attract foreign investment to your company?</h4><p>FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is currently negotiating with a leading international company to explore and expand into overseas markets by establishing a joint-venture company. Other companies in Iran have also benefitted from the technical and financial assistance that foreign investors can provide.</p><h4>Do you think the Iranian cement industry could do more to improve its record on the environment?</h4><p>Like many other industries in the world, the cement industry in Iran is facing the challenge of protecting the environment. FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is one of the pioneers of environmental protection activities in the Iranian cement industry, and we have an active engineering services company that controls pollution levels. We have been active in installing dust collecting equipment in several cement plants and in applying other measures to ensure compliance with environmental standards. FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is a sponsor of Iran's biodiversity and has a strict policy of periodical site visits to control environmental issues. The Iranian Department of the Environment supervises all of these activities.</p><h4>What do you think foreign investors should know about Iran and the local cement industry?</h4><p>Iran's cement industry has the capability to attract investors and enjoys a great deal of potential for development and progress. Its geographical advantage for the international trade in cement products is just one among many, thanks to its suitable location in the heart of the Middle East and its natural connection to all parts of the world through the Persian Gulf waterway as well as via overland connections to states in the CIS region and Turkey. All this has turned Iran into a unique strategic area.</p><p>In raw materials, Iranian cement plants have many desirable deposits of limestone, gypsum, and clay close to production facilities, and in many cases there is no need for extraction using explosives. Kaolin, pozzolan and many other additives and raw material mines are also readily available.</p><p>Iran can produce the best quality cement in the region. The Iranian national standard for cement was published 50 years ago, and the observation of this standard is mandatory for all cement producers in Iran. All cement plants have specific and specialized labs for quality control. In addition, more than 20,000 skilled employees are working in the management, engineering and technical departments of the cement industry and more than 80% of the equipment and machinery needed for greenfield projects is manufactured locally.</p><p>Our engineering services company has the capability and know-how to carry out and execute engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects, including management, plant design, mechanical and electrical installation, and construction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[plowing-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us a little background into ITMCO?</h4><p>ITMCO was established more than 40 years ago. It started off with a single tractor assembly line, which at that time was considered sufficient for the company's initial objective of meeting domestic needs. Since then we have grown to the point of not only supplying local demand, but also exporting our products overseas. Although we started off as a state company, we have over the past two years become a completely privately owned company.</p><p>We have 12 subsidiary companies, and we are the only company in Iran that now produces and assembles tractors. Our main production plant and head office are in Tabriz, but we also have factories for assembly in many different regions and cities across Iran.</p><h4>Which tractor parts do you produce yourselves?</h4><p>We produce the engines, the die-cast parts, the forged parts, everything. Our company Motor Sazan produces the engines under license from a British company, Perkins. All engine parts are made here in Iran, and our localization rate for parts is virtually 100%. The tractors are produced under a Massey-Ferguson license, but they carry the ITMCO brand, and they are all produced by us.</p><div class="quote">“exports is neighboring countries like Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan... We also export to some African countries..."</div><h4>The mechanization rate in the local agricultural sector is steadily increasing. How has the demand for tractors evolved in the last few years?</h4><p>Our Agriculture Ministry has made it an official government policy to increase the national mechanization rate to 1.1 horsepower per hectare. That rate is currently at around 0.8 horsepower. This new goal is a great opportunity to expand the market for our products, and of course it's also a great new opportunity for farmers to make their production much more efficient.</p><h4>How many tractors do you sell per year, and how much are you planning to expand production in the near future?</h4><p>We sold around 30,000 units last year. Hopefully, with the government's new strategic cap, our units per year could reach up to 35,000 this year. Our aim is to eventually double our production to 60,000 units per year.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Agriculture provide support for this mechanization plan?</h4><p>The state provides loans to farmers so they can buy tractors. The state also subsidizes our production.</p><h4>How have farmers responded to the new mechanization project?</h4><p>They accept it wholeheartedly, because it means the modernization of the entire sector. It means more production for them for less time and effort. However, the development of mechanization isn't only dependent on tractors, but also on combine harvesters, improved irrigation facilities, better implements, and the like. In all these areas, our agricultural sector is progressing step by step. In the last years, Iran has become self-sufficient in agricultural production. For us, the internal market is the main priority, then exports.</p><h4>Which countries do you export to?</h4><p>Our first priority for exports is neighboring countries like Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, and we export to all of them. We also export to some African countries like Kenya, Sudan, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Senegal. We have a good brand name, a good reputation, and we offer very competitive prices. We also offer excellent worldwide after-sales services, because we believe this is crucial in creating brand loyalty and ensuring that when a customer wants to buy another tractor, they will buy it from us.</p><h4>How large is your sales and services network?</h4><p>In Iran we have over 2,200 dealers selling our products and offering after-sales service. For foreign markets, we dispatch a team of experts to train partners who can offer the necessary after-sales service for ITMCO tractor owners. We pay them the cost of the after-sales service, so we don't make any profit from this. We offer free after-sales service for one year after purchase, or for 1,000 hours. After that a warranty applies, so we give spare parts and after-sales service by cost. We also give incentives and offer certain rewards to dealers who have the best sales figures.</p><h4>Do you have production facilities in other countries as well?</h4><p>Yes. Besides tractors that are exported abroad, some of the parts of our tractors are assembled in foreign countries, such as the tires, sheet metal, and the exhaust. Some countries we export to have small assembly lines, such as in Venezuela, Uganda, Senegal, and Tajikistan, where we have affiliated companies that produce brands like VENIRAN, UGIRAN, SENIRAN, and TAJIRAN, respectively. The reason we do this is so we can pack six tractors per container and thereby reduce shipping costs.</p><h4>How do you think the end to energy subsidies will affect your company?</h4><p>We have our own power station, and besides supplying our own energy needs, we also contribute to the Tabriz city power grid. So, we should be fine.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-their-hands]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How many private hospitals are there in Iran, and what is the national trend in terms of growth?</h4><p>We have around 150 private hospitals in all of Iran, though just 15 top-grade hospitals in the capital Tehran. The Ministry of Health uses different criteria to evaluate hospitals as a public service for citizens and only a limited number can receive the top grade. Atieh Hospital is one of these hospitals that has received a top grade.</p><h4>Do you specialize in any particular medical conditions, or are you more of a general hospital?</h4><p>We are a general hospital. We have specialists in every branch of the health services: oncology, midwifery, surgery, neurology, pediatrics, ICU, CCU, and open heart ICU. We even do plastic surgery.</p><h4>How many physicians do you employ?</h4><p>Over 300, and 130 of them are shareholders in the hospital.</p><div class="quote">“One of the policies the government is debating is on possibly privatizing some state hospitals."</div><h4>What is your bed and patient capacity?</h4><p>We have 350 beds, but only 303 are active. We host 24,000 patients and perform 12,000 surgical procedures annually.</p><h4>Who are your main clients?</h4><p>We have different patients, though 60% have private insurance, and 40% do not use insurance. The reason they come to this hospital is because they are able to pay for their medical care.</p><h4>There is actually a vast network of public health care in Iran, but the number of private hospitals is increasing. Why do you think this is the case, and how do you see the future of this trend?</h4><p>Maybe it is because the people have improved economic means. The more incomes improve, the more private hospitals there will be. These are the policies of the government. Since the Second Five-Year Development Plan, private medical centers and hospitals have been on the increase. One of the policies the government is debating is on possibly privatizing some state hospitals.</p><h4>In Parand City, for example, the developers are looking for someone to build a hospital. Do you have any plans to expand and establish other hospitals in the country?</h4><p>We have bought land near here so we will first expand our hospital in Tehran. In the future, maybe we will go to Turkey to consult with the engineers of their hospitals, such as Anadolu Hospital, to help establish that style of healthcare facility in Iran. We want to use Turkish architects and experts to design and construct hospitals in Iran.</p><h4>Do you have plans to open hospitals in other cities?</h4><p>It is our goal to have a chain of hospitals, but we have some legal limitations from the government. If the government allows us, we will become a chain-style hospital in the future. We aspire to have a brand name.</p><h4>Talking about the future, 70% of the Iranian population is under 35 years of age. As older people tend to frequent hospitals more, how do you see that affecting your hospital in the future?</h4><p>In 10 years, there will be three important diseases. These diseases are diabetes, coronary issues, and psychiatric illness. Our goal is to focus on these three deficiencies, and to have the best services for these three complaints. We have also established some tourism facilities using the Atieh brand name. We have a hotel complex in the north of Iran and a water park, and all of them use the name Atieh as a brand.</p><h4>Is it related to medical tourism, for example, to attract medical patients from abroad?</h4><p>Not now, no. If we have some patients from abroad, we have a contract with companies that arrange the hotels, and provide services to these patients, and we give the clinical services to them because it is our specialty.</p><h4>So there is no project in the future for your hospital or Iran to develop medical tourism?</h4><p>No, because of legal limitations. If someone comes here for services and there is an accident and the worst happens, we cannot coordinate what needs to be done with their country. Because of this legal limitation, we are obliged to use an intermediary company for these patients.</p><h4>From which countries do you receive most of your patients?</h4><p>Azerbaijan, Iraq, Afghanistan, the UAE, and other Arab countries. They come here because we have very good physicians and doctors.</p><h4>As a hospital administrator, how do Iranian doctors compare to their international counterparts?</h4><p>It depends on many factors. Fertility treatment is one good example. Because of the culture and beliefs of the Islamic countries near Iran, and because of the specializations we have in Iran, they come here for treatment. Maybe some people prefer to come to our country because of the experience of our physicians. For example, many rhinoplasty procedures are performed here. Because of that, maybe they prefer to come to an expert physician because of his or her experience, and they want to have that procedure performed here.</p><h4>Are you looking for foreign investors to help finance the new hospital?</h4><p>We would be glad to receive the cooperation of Turkish institutes. One of our limitations is that the process of cooperating with other countries takes too much time in Iran. If we go to Turkey and we want to have a contract with a medical institute, maybe after six days we can get a license. In Iran it could take two years to obtain a license. Because of this limitation, foreign investment is difficult, though it is something we are working on.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Very Good Market Again]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-very-good-market-again]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Construction is one of the current needs in Iran. At the moment, government statistics suggest that we need more than 1 million housing units to be built every year due to the rapid growth of Iran's young population. This young population is approaching marriageable age and they need homes. This is the first factor driving this industry. The second factor is that if you look at construction as an opportunity to invest in a field of production, then we feel that this field is, and will continue to be, very profitable in Iran. As far back as I can remember, for the last 50 years, it has always been a profitable field. People need new homes regardless of inflation.<br></p><p>The construction industry in Iran is the locomotive of the economy. I believe that 80% of our industries are related, in some way, to construction. If you want to put it in terms of who has the dominant role in construction, then, at the moment in Iran, it is the government with its mass housing program. The Mehr Housing Project consists of a number of very large projects. On the other hand, there are also private sector players whose activities are completely different from those of the government. We concentrate on more luxurious projects in order to create a quality living atmosphere, and this cannot be done cheaply. Therefore, in the luxury segment of the construction industry, the government is not the dominant player. Especially when you look at profitability, a greater percentage goes to the private sector.</p><p>At the moment, we may say there is a stagnating real estate market because, two years ago, we had a very fast rise in inflation in the real estate market. Since then, this rise in prices has stopped, but this doesn't mean that the prices have come down. Now, how has this affected the cost of the square meter? It depends on the location. In the northern part of Tehran, the cost per square meter starts at about 4 million tomans, which is about $4,000 dollars. In other areas I've heard almost 12 million tomans. In this part of Tehran, you will find the most expensive residential and commercial areas, although prices have come down over the past two years.</p><div class="quote">“We invest in both residential and commercial projects. In our case, they have all been luxury developments..."</div><p>This may be a classic case of a real estate bubble, but the effects of the bubble were not that severe because at the moment we have a very good market for cheap houses and raw materials for construction are cheap in Iran. As an example, when you look at prices and the cost of construction, the cost of construction for luxury units reaches a maximum of 30% of the sales price. This is very profitable, and this is the reason why I told you that the stagnation at the moment is due to the bubble. The bubble is broken, so we have stagnation, but I'm sure within the next year we are going to see a very good market again.</p><p>At the moment, the construction of commercial developments is the best opportunity, because more private firms are entering the market, and there is an increased need for quality shopping malls. More and more retail chains are arriving because there is a great demand for them in this country. So, as I've said before, there are a lot of opportunities in Iran.</p><p>In order for Iran to improve, I think it is a very good idea to introduce Iran to the international business community and to show that Iran is a good and safe place for investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[elixir-of-life]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's mission in the pharmaceuticals sector, and how is it planning to reach this aim?</h4><p>We want to be a life sciences company, and not only be focused on manufacturing medicine. Life sciences comprise all the biological sciences supported by large sections of complementary sciences and technologies, such as bioinformatics and telemedicine. Our company believes we are providing treatments, not just pharmaceuticals. Treatment covers a wider spectrum, and can help people receive more support from companies. Nowadays, pharmaceutical companies support and educate patients, and provide other requirements. For example, in diabetes you can't just produce insulin, you must also educate the diabetic patients, physicians, nurses, and care providers. Also, we have developed some plans for monitoring patient blood glucose levels and are helping to screen people to find pre-diabetic patients. Therefore, Exir is contributing to the overall health level of the society. Indeed, we want to expand our activities and penetrate further into the market via this approach.</p><h4>How does a life sciences company differ in approach from a pharmaceuticals company?</h4><p>Life sciences is a term that covers different segments of the healthcare environment. We are one of the stakeholders in the healthcare environment. Every stakeholder has their own needs and requirements, such as the government, policy makers, and universities, and a life sciences company should establish relationships will all these different stakeholders. We are the manufacturer, so we should make a bridge between ourselves and the educational and research sectors. In my point of view, the meaning of being a life sciences company is to be a major part of the healthcare environment.</p><h4>Do you engage in any export activities?</h4><p>Yes, we have registered our products in 20 countries. Exir has been nominated as “the exemplary exporter of the year" in Iran for four years. It is the only pharmaceutical company in Iran that has such a position. Exir is Iran's leading pharmaceutical export company.</p><div class="quote">“We are providing treatments, not just pharmaceuticals..."</div><h4>Which countries do you mostly send your exports?</h4><p>We mostly export our products to Ukraine and neighboring countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. We have registered our products in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Belarus, which also means our vision is not bound to our neighbors alone. Currently, we are trying to register our products in Venezuela, Brazil, and in other parts of South America. In North America, we have established ExirPharma Inc. We are shareholders and are developing new brands in Canada, such as Mixnatural® and Maximed®.</p><h4>What are the challenges to exports, since Iran is not part of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and your customers in other countries are subject to high tariffs?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices—a general term for standards in the pharmaceutical industry) aspect of the company. For exports to highly regulated markets such as the European Union and North America the company must first be audited by their regulatory authorities. Every country has its own regulations, and some of them want documents in specialized formats such as CTD. It can take a long time to register a product in a new country as the health authorities are concerned about the health of their people. Therefore, the main barrier is the GMP condition of the manufacturer and then the ability to provide the required documents. The tariffs due to non-membership in the WTO do not affect us because we can offer competitive prices to our customers.</p><h4>In 2008, Exir Pharma was selected as the best R&amp;D division in Iran. How much of your budget do you spend on R&amp;D?</h4><p>The R&amp;D costs for Exir are around 5%of the total budget. The success of our R&amp;D department has been mainly due to our relationship with big multinational pharmaceutical companies and the manufacturing of under license products. Another important issue is the collaboration of Exir with successful research centers and universities for product development. Exir owes its rapid expansion and progress to the creativity, innovativeness, and continuous efforts of its management and staff.</p><h4>What are the benefits of being able to work with these major pharmaceutical companies?</h4><p>Under-license products get higher prices. It also allows the people in the company to learn different aspects of the pharmaceutical environment, for example in marketing, sales, and quality assurance. It is all a matter of technology transfer. Also, these companies help Exir bring its standards into compliance with international norms, which adds to Exir's reputation in terms of the quality of its products. It encourages other pharmaceutical companies to come and work with us.</p><h4>What do you think should be done to attract more of these companies to the Iranian market?</h4><p>Iran is an emerging market in the pharmaceutical sector. The rate of increase in the value of pharmaceutical market is around 25% per year here. With the $3 billion value of the market, in the next five years it will reach $9 billion. There are around 23 countries in the world that you can call emerging markets, and 30% of the growth in the global pharmaceutical industry belongs to these 23 countries. Iran is one of these emerging markets. Due to the financial recession and the problems in big markets like the US and Europe, most of the focus of the major pharmaceutical companies has been on these markets.</p><h4>Does the government support collaboration with other companies such as under-license agreements, or does it prefer generic production?</h4><p>The country's biggest focus is on generic production, because the government seeks to supply the people with cheap but high-quality products. Most of the products that are common to the market after one or two years receive insurance coverage, and some of them can even receive subsidies. The focus of the Iranian Ministry of Health is on local and generic manufacturing, but it supports under-license production and patents.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sort of products and services does your company provide to the medical industry?</h4><p>We mainly supply Siemens imaging products to hospitals and imaging centers, including systems such as MRI, X-ray, and ultra-sound. In addition, we provide machines necessary for endoscopy, though these are supplied by Olympus, a Japanese company. Also, we supply surgical products like staples and sutures for open and laparoscopic surgery, and we source these from different parts of the world. These are examples of some of the advanced surgical products that we supply to hospitals—both private and state. We also supply products from Getinge and Maquet, their products cover CSR, operating room equipment, and ventilators.</p><h4>What is the percentage of private institutions in the healthcare system, and what is the relationship between the Social Security Organization (SSO) and the public and private hospital systems?</h4><p>In the past it was mainly the government who took care of health care, but it is almost 10 years since the government decided to transfer part of the responsibility for health care to the private sector. Based on the figures we have, 10 years ago 90-95% of our turnover was coming from the public sector and the rest was coming from the private sector. Now it has changed, with maybe 50-55% coming from the public system and 45-50% from the private sector. These are our figures; I don't know the figure for the total market. In Iran, we have three different types of medical services. One is government owned and run, which is covered by the medical science universities. We have in each province a medical science university that covers a few hospitals. They also provide training for doctors and nurses. In addition to that we have the SSO, and it owns very good hospitals in each city. It's not strictly governmental, although very close.</p><p>The private sector has invested a lot in the last 10 years, and in the last five years the number of private hospitals has doubled. Parsian Hospital, for example, is a very good hospital with modern, high-tech equipment. Not that long ago we had a ceremony over there and opened a new integrated operating theater, which was a very nice combination of Olympus and Getinge technology. It's a new type of operating room where everything can be done by remote control.</p><div class="quote">“There is now active competition between private hospitals to invest more and more in their equipment..."</div><p>In Iran, high-income earners invest a lot in their own health, and they represent maybe 10% of the population, which is not a small number, maybe 7 million. There is now active competition between private hospitals to invest more and more in their equipment and on the quality of services they provide.</p><h4>How do you think the quality differs between them?</h4><p>For sure, the private hospital sector is the best because you have to pay and when you have to pay they have to offer you better services, that applies to the nursing system and the general attitude of the people. Then it goes to the medical science universities, because they are teaching hospitals they have good instructors and good expertise, although most of the operations are performed by the students and residents.</p><h4>So if you go to a private hospital, does the SSO cover the services you receive?</h4><p>If you have complementary insurance besides governmental insurance you can go to any hospital and private insurance will cover at least part of the fees. But if you are not covered by a complementary policy, and if you want to use government insurance only, many hospitals won't accept you.</p><h4>Do you have special agreements with the Ministry of Health or with the SSO to sell your products?</h4><p>It depends, any medical company who wants to work in Iran has to have a license from the Ministry of Health. It's quite a complicated process; we have to register for each company and each product. For the sale of products sometimes a tender is announced and then we participate in the tender and provide and supply the requested items. Sometimes it's not like that, with each organization, hospital, or medical science university buying a limited amount for itself by inviting a few companies to submit offers. Every few years or so the government decides to announce a large tender, for instance three years ago there was a tender for 25 hospitals. It bought all of the products it needed for these 25 hospitals from one supplier, and the contract was won by us. But I do not think this is a good way of doing business, because then the other companies complain a lot, and it also scares us because this means that in the next tender we may be put in a similar position.</p><h4>Medical tourism is beginning to increase in popularity in Iran. Where do you think the most medical tourists come from, the Middle East or Europe?</h4><p>There are different figures, but between 3 million to 4 million Iranians live outside Iran. They come back to visit frequently and plastic surgery has become very popular. Maybe one in five women has their nose redone. It's still not very popular for men, though. Many non-resident Iranians are coming from Europe and the US to have their operations done here. The other thing is that some people from Iran's neighbors, such as Kuwait and Bahrain, come here because they prefer to be treated in an Islamic country. Concerning the knowledge and equipment, we have no problem, but there are some other things that should be sorted out in order to absorb more tourists, such as relaxed visa requirements, social activities, and similar things. Because when you go to a city you go for a specific reason—but at the same time you look for social activities and other touristic attractions.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the quality of medical staff in Iran?</h4><p>After the Revolution the state trained lots of doctors and medical staff, so in numerical terms we are comparatively well off. Qualitatively it's also comparatively good because they have training and what they receive is good quality. The worst point is that we don't have the medical ethic. Medical staff do not obey the ethics of treatment as they do in other parts of the world. For example, those who work in hospitals should think differently from others, and if they see somebody sick and you are a doctor, no matter if he pays or not, you have to treat him. But here it's not like that and everything is related to money. The way that they approach the patient is not very professional. That's something that in many discussions with ministers and doctors we discuss because we need to improve this situation.</p><h4>Do you experience any problems with shipments?</h4><p>Fortunately, nothing very serious. The customs in Iran are very bureaucratic for any product that you want to release from the customs house. You have to have the permission of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Commerce and then go to customs to obtain its release. In other parts of the world, for example in Armenia, the products are shipped to companies via DHL, and then the day after that you receive it at your office, not in the customs house. Siemens has established a huge warehouse in Frankfurt and they told us that we would not need one in Tehran because of this huge investment. Yet, due to problems at customs we have to have a warehouse in Tehran. We aim to get rid of it, because it's an unnecessary cost for us, though we cannot do that at the moment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From which countries do you receive the most tourists, and what is the main purpose for them coming to Iran?</h4><p>Most tourists come for cultural reasons as they are interested in seeing Iran's cultural heritage, and they are mainly from Europe. After Europe the US supplies the second largest group of visitors to Iran. Then we have Australians, Canadians, and Japanese groups. Actually, the UK, although also a part of Europe, ranks second after Europe itself. We have lots of groups coming from the UK. There are also many international institutes, museums, and universities that trust Pasargad Tours to plan and program educational trips to Iran. Pasargad Tours is also involved in cultural and musical events such as concerts at Persepolis (2006), Saadabad Palace (2007), and Vahdat Hall in Tehran (2010). Another side of tourism is that of groups coming for pilgrimage purposes from Kuwait, the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and even from Turkey.</p><h4>What sort of obstacles do you face in trying to make Iran a better known destination?</h4><p>Persuading people in the West and around the world that Iran is a new tourism destination was something that took a lot of effort to market, promote, advertise, and present in all the international markets. That was one side of the obstacle that had to be overcome. The other was to convince the government, as it has other problems occupying its attention. However, the government did support us after we convinced it. I did a lot of talking with members of the government about promoting tourism in that era. After the few steps that I already mentioned were solved, we needed to address what tourists really require: hotels, transportation, and other facilities. The hotels were in a very bad state; they had to be promoted, reconstructed, and renovated. Transportation had to be revolutionized because the system had not been used to transport tourists in a comfortable manner. And third was facilitating the regulations and laws for tourist visas and other paperwork, which at that time were very bureaucratic.</p><h4>How did you manage to address all of these massive infrastructure deficiencies?</h4><p>In 1991 and 1992, when the first groups started to flock into the country, we didn't even have properly trained tour guides because there were no schools or universities with any courses to teach them. It was at that time that I established a research center in Pasargad Tours. This was a kind of tour guide school to educate those interested in tour guiding, and who had some background in Persian history and a good command of a foreign language. We taught them how to approach tourists and how to guide them; the ethics of the whole job. I am now very proud to announce that Pasargad Tours currently has  67 well-trained tour guides in many languages such as German, Japanese, French and Spanish; not just English. When the research center was first established its main purpose was to solve our own problems at Pasargad Tours and to provide us with properly trained tour guides for our own groups. In addition to that, Pasargad Tours also tailor makes itineraries to satisfy the needs of our clients in eco-tourism and historical interests. But after solving our own issues, we began negotiating with the government. With its help we opened training schools for tour guides and trained more people in order to promote tourism in Iran. In the course of all those negotiations and the opening of all those training centers, we have accrued over 3,000 certified tour guides, with 500 of them actively working in the business.</p><div class="quote">“One of the most important aspects of tourism is that it gives the opportunity to those visiting Iran to get a true feeling for Iranian hospitality."</div><h4>Aside from tour guides, is there any other skill set in demand to improve Iranian tourism?</h4><p>Actually, in the course of all these educational efforts two of the universities in Tehran also began teaching tourism management, and smaller training schools now cover hotel management and other services. One of them is Tehran University, which has a newly opened tourism faculty and another one that has been working for some years now. They offer hotel management and there are also smaller training schools that have shorter periods of training in order to obtain a certificate.</p><h4>Is the current skill level of these newly trained employees adequate for the industry?</h4><p>It is adequate and is improving day by day in parallel with the universities training highly leveled academic teachers. In Tehran, we have 18 training schools offering four-month educational courses, and even some of the managers and personnel of the hotels and tourism agencies are now being retrained in order to reach the same standard as the new generation coming into the business. With the increase in hotels being built and the increasing number of tourists showing interest in coming to Iran, there is higher demand for tourism courses. Even members of the younger generation are becoming more interested in the tourism industry and want to participate in the sector. It is the hotel sector that is now in need of training in order to improve standards. The transport segment is now being addressed, and there is no driver that has not been trained in order to know how to behave, drive, and understand the ethics of the business. You have to take the courses and get the certificates in order to be a bus driver for tourists.</p><h4>So the motive came from the private sector and then the government responded?</h4><p>Normally, the ideas and recommendations come from private sector operators. They encounter the problems first, and then reflect this to the government to obtain support in facilitating regulations or in making exceptions. For example, the private sector now receives a 60% discount from municipalities on building hotels. The government is now convinced that the tourism industry brings income to the country and that it provides work and creates jobs for the young generation, which in Iran makes up a significant percentage of the population. Also, one of the most important aspects of tourism is that it gives the opportunity to those visiting Iran to get a true feeling for Iranian hospitality. This changes the bad image provided by the press and media in Western countries in favor of something more accurate. By coming and seeing Iran for themselves, they can see that some of the things that have been said have no truth to them.</p><h4>Are there any other tax exemptions on those looking to build hotels?</h4><p>One of the major exemptions is that tour agencies that are members of the Iran Tour Operators Association (ITOA) are exempt from any sort of tax. They work tax free, which is quite a plus to promote tourism and help them focus more on marketing to tourists in Iran. Also, the government is covering 50% of the expenses needed for Iranian tour agencies to participate in European, American or international market events around the world like ITB, WTM, or USTOA or other major conventions.</p><h4>What is holding the tourism industry back from expanding? Have foreign investors begun to enter the market?</h4><p>If the image of Iran as a destination changes for the better, an increase of 2 million more tourists is possible, and then we will need to improve our offering to tourists. Foreign investment is very much allowed; it actually depends on how much demand is required. For example, Pasargad Tours is building hotels, but we are engaged in some other projects to build hotels around the country. But the first step is to build a five-star hotel, which is underway in Tehran. If the whole situation goes well, then foreign investors have expressed their willingness to participate in the project.</p><h4>How does ITOA help promote the Iranian tourism industry?</h4><p>If it wasn't for ITOA most of the achievements that we see in the tourism industry in Iran today wouldn't have happened.  ITOA is the house of the private sector tourism industry. It encouraged the government to facilitate visas, which was very difficult. Refurbishing and renovating hotels was also another demand and another way to make the government devote money towards reconstruction or even to facilitate or exempt some of the regulations of the private sector in order to encourage investors to engage more in the sector. ITOA is the main lobbying group setting the policies of the tourism industry in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Arya Sasol's vision is to be a leading polyethylene producer in the Middle East. How does your strategy match with your overall vision?</h4><p>The Arya Sasol Polymer Company (ASPC) is primarily a polymer producing company that has an excess of produced ethylene feedstock that we export. Arya Sasol's production assets are world scale, and at the time of investment they were the latest technologies and consist of an ethylene cracker and two polyethylene production plants. The original scope of the investment was to have a third polymer plants but this investment has yet to be approved. The original ASPC joint venture was between the National Petrochemical Company (NPC) of Iran and Sasol of South Africa and was formed in 2002. The investment decision was taken in 2003, and ethylene production started in 2007, with polyethylene soon after in 2008.</p><h4>What is the production volume of Arya Sasol?</h4><p>The production assets of ASPC are a one million ton per annum of ethylene cracker and two 300,000 ton per annum polyethylene plants, one producing low density and the other medium- and high-density polymers.</p><h4>What are some highlights from Arya Sasol's experience in 2011? What factors contributed to the company's strong performance?</h4><p>Our business achieved a world-class, 12-month recordable accident case rate of 0.25, for the Iranian year 1390. The year also saw the sustained and high volumes of supplied ethane, our feed gas for the cracker, from our current shareholder Pars Petrochemical Company. This enabled consistent production across all of Arya Sasol's production assets. The low-density plant exceeded its design capacity. Arya Sasol also began managing and exporting its own ethylene exports. Overall, it was a good year.</p><div class="quote">“There are significant synergies gained by being in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone."</div><h4>Your plants are located in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) and Arya Sasol was one of the first companies to establish operations there. What makes the zone attractive for business?</h4><p>There are significant synergies gained by being in the PSEEZ. The most significant being the shared process utilities ASPC receives from Mobin, the utility supplier. The site is very well integrated with pipeline interconnections on feedstock and product lines. These enable production flexibility between the various petrochemical businesses during periods of production and feed upsets. There is a common spirit of goodwill amongst the producers in the PSEEZ to ensure we all succeed.</p><h4>Which countries do you export to the most?</h4><p>ASPC is a joint venture. Our shareholders have appointed polymer off-takers to manage the marketing, logistics, and sales of the produced polyethylene. Ethylene sales are managed internally by ASPC. All of ASPC's products are marketed and sold to our customers in Europe, Far East Asia, and China.</p><h4>Arya Sasol puts a lot of energy into manpower training and environmental issues. How is your company implementing its strategies in these fields?</h4><p>There are some 800 permanent staff and a further 500 contractors working for Arya Sasol, making us a significant employer in the PSEEZ. There is a government initiative to maximize employment from local areas, which Arya Sasol fully supports. The local Iranian workforce is relatively inexperienced in petrochemical operations, as this is a relatively new industry to this part of the country. Therefore, sourcing experienced people for the industry is difficult unless you widen your search to the national population. Our strategy is to employ people from local areas wherever possible, but if the skills are not available we unfortunately have no other option but to recruit nationally. However, we have created a large number of training positions and apprenticeships within all disciplines of Arya Sasol, and these are designated for locals only. This gives locals the opportunity to gain experience and grow within Arya Sasol. In addition, we are also working with local universities on scholarships and related projects. Selected students are offered vocation work with Arya Sasol to gain experience in their chosen professions. All of these initiatives are coordinated with local government institutions in an effort to promote opportunities for local populace. I'm very pleased with the Iranian workforce. They're young, well qualified, energetic, and eager to learn. That has to be a winning formula. We are also an accredited ISO 14001 facility. We are audited every year by an accredited external company and pass these audits with excellent results. Similarly to our values regarding the safety and health of our employees, Arya Sasol has also set world-class standards for our environmental compliance. While we face many challenges, especially with the current lack of a formal hazardous waste landfill facility in the PSEEZ, our air emissions are monitored by an independent accredited authority, and both our air emissions and water outfalls more than comply with Iranian legislative requirements. As I have mentioned before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees and conducting responsible operations within our environment are primary Arya Sasol values.</p><h4>How would you assess the quality of your materials vis-í -vis your competitors in Iran?</h4><p>It is hard to answer this question as we export all of our products. Therefore in theory our competitors are all the other global and national polymer manufacturers. As a brand ASPC polymers are highly respected in the regions they are sold. This is due to the combined efforts of the operations and the off-takers to ensure product quality, grade planning and logistics sales and marketing are all focused to meet the customer's expectations.  There are large Middle Eastern capacity additions planned, under construction, or about to commence production, and so it is important for Arya Sasol to continuously monitor the quality, grade range, and packaging offer of its products in order to ensure that we remain competitive. Our capital spend is thus focused on improving these and productivity.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your appointment as CEO of UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) coincided with the organization's new five-year strategy to adopt a more entrepreneurial approach. What is the practical impact of this approach in countries such as Mexico?<br></h4><p>The reason we decided to embark on a more entrepreneurial approach at UKTI—and in the government in general—relates to the measures that the authorities have taken to control our domestic debt. Internal demand is inevitably constrained, and we have to support our growth through exports and foreign investments. This approach is also being implemented at a time when traditional markets are weak. For example, we know the issues that the EU and the US are struggling with; there has to be a particularly big shift in terms of attention to the large emerging markets where there is evidence of growth potential in the medium term. At the moment, the UK has obtained a 3.4% share of the imports of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Meanwhile, we have only 1.2% of the share of imports from economies registering huge growth. The principal challenge for the UK is to close the gap and boost the share of our exports to emerging markets, and there is no reason why this should not be the case. As emerging markets develop, their consumption patterns align with those of the markets in which there are already successful exporters. Considering a country like Mexico, it becomes a clear priority in that sense. It has a large emerging economy, sound macroeconomic policies, terrific demographics, and excellent opportunities—not only as a market itself, but also as a springboard to the US and the rest of the region. We have less than a 1% share of Mexico's imports. Although we are starting from a low base, we believe that it is possible to build strong ties from there. We have seen an increase in our exports to Mexico over the last couple of years, and we set the target of doubling our export volumes by 2015.</p><h4>In terms of FDI, which sectors of the Mexican economy do investments from the UK enhance the most?</h4><p>The energy sector is very interesting at the moment. The oil and gas sector in Mexico, which has been fairly closed in the past, is now opening up. There are huge opportunities onshore and offshore as well, particularly in terms of deep-sea exploration and extraction. The UK-based company Petrofac was the recent winner of the first two private contracts for operational rights in a Mexican oil field in more than 70 years. When we move to deep-sea offshore opportunities, which we will be doing over the next year, we will clearly need the technology of major firms such as BP and Shell, and it will be very competitive. I also believe that there are big opportunities in infrastructure. Huge developments are happening in Mexico—new cities, roads, and energy developments. The UK is strong and competitive in these areas. A third sector is retail, where there are a variety of good prospects. We are starting from the beginning, but the large and growing middle class already consumes many of the goods we offer. For example, high-end fashion such as Burberry is already operating in Mexico. Accessorize opened its first store in Mexico City in 2010, and has opened three new stores since then, leading the way for many other companies. Education is the fourth area where there are real opportunities for partnership and collaboration in a broader sense. Of course, we can attract Mexican students to the UK, but cooperation and partnerships between universities and specific areas is another important aspect. For example, we are focused on the energy industry in terms of forming academic partnerships.</p><div class="quote">“We are focused on the energy industry in terms of forming academic partnerships."</div><h4>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has approved £45 million to support SME exports. How does Mexico fit into this strategy?</h4><p>One of the messages that we are trying to get across to SMEs is that it is absolutely possible, with the proper preparation and proper engagement with experts such as ourselves and our trade team in Mexico, to engage in emerging markets like Mexico. There is an understandable fear of looking beyond the traditional markets of Europe and the US among many investors. However, the fact that we have witnessed many successful individual cases demonstrates the ease and opportunity of establishing an SME. Indeed, it is relatively simple to establish a business in Mexico, and tariffs and regulatory demands are relaxed. Therefore, Mexico has taken the center stage of our SME program.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENOC has noted the need for a driven strategy to increase its resilience in the face of an increasingly changing and competitive market. How is this strategy being put into practice?</h4><p>The energy market is changing. The complexity of doing business has increased, especially after the global financial crisis. The government of Dubai has set up the Supreme Council of Energy to focus on the future energy security of Dubai. Growth cannot be driven without securing energy supplies. In the past, because there were different energy organizations in Dubai, there was no proper coordination. The Council has brought all the entities that are working in the energy sector under one umbrella to undertake long-term planning and develop strategies to meet the Emirate's requirements. Hence, the 2030 Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy has been adopted.</p><h4>What is the next step in developing a strategy?</h4><p>From ENOC's perspective, we are looking at being more focused on securing upstream assets. We have created a dedicated team to evaluate asset opportunities. Of course, the market has been changing rapidly, and we are closely monitoring the situation. Historically, most of our focus was on Dubai and the Northern Emirates, but with the overall market conditions, and the rapid growth in the UAE, in Dubai in particular, we have also started focusing on driving international growth and finding opportunities to build on the experience we have gathered in the past. Internationally, there are a lot more opportunities to grow, and we are working on these too. Our operations are set to spread across East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In building upstream opportunities, we are also looking for growth opportunities. In the past we have not been involved in gas activities, and we are strongly considering gas trading and supply. This could become an integral part of our business. We are also evaluating other potential opportunities in the UAE, and in Dubai. This is only part of our strategic growth vision.</p><div class="quote">“From ENOC's perspective, we are looking at being more focused on securing upstream assets."</div><h4>The Supreme Council of Energy has declared its commitment to reducing Dubai's dependence on gas imports from elsewhere in the Gulf. What can be done to achieve this goal?</h4><p>Identifying alternate energy sources, focusing on renewables, and promoting a culture of energy efficiency across all stakeholders are keys to driving the goal of reducing the dependence on gas imports. ENOC has already developed concerted initiatives to promote the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) as a fuel alternative, and the response has been extremely encouraging. What is crucial is to roll out sustained customer and user awareness initiatives, and ENOC is supporting this through various corporate social responsibility programs. We established a long-term strategy to achieve this. The Gulf is rich in gas supplies, but today the supply of gas through Dubai comes from Abu Dhabi and the Dolphin pipeline. It is the only source today, and there is scope for expansion. Already, Dubai has established its first LNG facilities, which could address gas shortage and the Supreme Council of Energy is planning to diversify energy sources to find a good balance.</p><h4>What potential do you see for the development of the clean energy sector, and in what ways do you support its evolution?</h4><p>Promoting sustainable development is an initiative of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and is an integral part of our strategy. Apart from price volatilities, we have seen two key changes that are relevant not only for the region but also globally. The first is the increasing importance that the region's governments are placing on sustainable development. The second is the growing awareness among customers to adopt energy-efficient measures. ENOC is supporting the government's Green Vision as well as addressing customer requirements for a “greener" lifestyle through various initiatives. To promote the use of compressed natural gas, Emirates Gas, a subsidiary of ENOC, has been working closely with the Roads &amp; Transport Authority (RTA) to introduce CNG to public transport to enhance environmental protection. A unique model of pipeless natural gas fuel stations has been proposed in Dubai as part of plans to implement cost-effective and environmentally friendly natural gas transportation. At a macro level, recently the Sheikh Mohammed Solar Energy Park was announced, which will be the first of its kind in the region. Solar power is used heavily in the Gulf, but only by smaller communities and is not very effective as of now. By 2030 we are hoping that the energy mix will contain at least 5% generated through solar panels. The vision behind such initiatives is to utilize and develop the energy matrix. It is, however, very important to encourage the development of a regulatory system to handle it. Solar power has its own challenges, but today I think it is the most viable option. Part of our strategy is nuclear power. Today, Abu Dhabi is developing nuclear power and Dubai is a part of that vision. We have been negotiating to see how we can utilize this form of power. ENOC will continue to partner in environmentally responsible initiatives and promote a culture of sustainability, which is important in addressing the growing energy demand faced by the region, as well as mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><h4>The UAE's proximity to emerging Asian markets presents numerous opportunities. What do you foresee as being the key developments over the coming years?</h4><p>I believe that a large part of the demand for petroleum products will be led by the Asian economies, and the proximity of the Middle East to the fast-growing emerging markets in Asia serves as a tremendous opportunity for the region's oil and gas companies. The increased ties between the Middle East and the growing Asian nations will drive the oil trade, which will offset any demand reduction from the developed nations that are witnessing sluggish economic activity. Demand for petroleum products is expected to rise to 90.7 million barrels per day—an all-time high. A large part of this strong demand will be driven by the non-Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, with Asian economies taking the lead followed by the Middle East. Dubai's core sectors—trade, tourism, and transport—have supported the city's overall economic growth. The aviation sector has in particular been a driving force and we anticipate it to remain one of the strongest growth pillars of Dubai's economy.</p><h4>ENOC's subsidiary EPPCO supplies lubricant products to many countries. What developments can we expect from this sector in the coming years?</h4><p>ENOC Lubricants is already expanding its market presence in the Middle East region, the Indian Subcontinent, and African markets. In the coming years, we expect the company to further strengthen its market reach, and offer the full spectrum of products, especially with a focus on improved fuel mileage, increased cooling efficiency, excellent engine protection, and environmental friendliness. This was highlighted recently with the launch of a top-tier synthetic oil, the Protec Flex Energy SN, a first of its kind in the Middle East and Africa. The new product has the highest certification in the region. It also meets the requirements of all types of vehicles—from hybrid vehicles to model vehicles from the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How competitive is Mexico when compared to the rest of Latin America and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)?<br></h4><p>The global economic crisis that occurred in 2008 and 2009 marked a coming of age for the Mexican economy, making it behave in a mature way despite a dramatic shock to the real economy and a loss of employment, as well as a contraction in GDP. Mexico is now coming back in a strong position due to stability, which is in huge contrast to the Mexico of my youth when a crisis could break the country for a decade. Mexico has demographic strengths, relating to the amount of people in employment and the amount of people receiving pensions, and those too young to work. Our political system also received a shock during the 2006 presidential elections, but we managed to solve the political conflict through institutions and electoral tribunes, which also represented a coming of age for Mexican democracy. Compared to some of the BRICs, such as China, Mexico has succeeded in achieving a stable, democratic political environment. There is no better system than democracy. Mexico also has huge consumer power, on par with the BRICs. Its free trade agreements are also well developed, and this is positive when looking at the situation of other Latin American countries.</p><h4>What major steps have been taken to improve the competitive index?</h4><p>We cannot point to the government when discussing competitiveness. A famous political commentator once said that there are a number of centers of power, and one of those is Congress. Sadly, Congress is not up to the task of promoting reforms as fast as it should in order to keep pace and increase productivity to make Mexico an even more attractive destination for talent and investment. Mexico is achieving macroeconomic goals in many areas, including inflation, which Banco de México has kept at around 3%. Now, the challenge is to transform this low inflation rate into low credit interest rates, which are still at a level generally seen in developing economies. The country does, however, need to shake up its attitude to collecting taxes, as the collection regime has been too relaxed in the past.</p><div class="quote">“The Mexican government has made huge efforts to simplify the process of starting companies."</div><h4>What role does innovation in human capital development play in the development of Mexico's competitiveness?</h4><p>One thing we have found is that we need to improve the quality of Mexican schools. Having more years of education improves the income level of an individual. If you don't finish secondary school, you are severely disadvantaged. If you finish university, your income will be, on average, 150% higher than if you don't finish high school. Therefore, we need to improve the education sector, and guarantee that Mexican children stay in school longer.</p><h4>What have been the effects of the country's security concerns on its perception abroad?</h4><p>We receive a lot of foreign investment, but it is impossible to know what is going on in the boardrooms of potential foreign investors around the world. The issue is, would you stop going to New York because New Orleans or Detroit have high murder rates? Of course not. Certain regions are experiencing problems, yet most states have no trouble.</p><h4>You have defined competitiveness as the ability of a country to attract investment. How is Mexico working to ensure the attraction and retention of investment?</h4><p>The Mexican government has made huge efforts to simplify the process of starting companies. One of the best decisions it has made was to liquidate the electric utility that served Mexico City and the surrounding areas in 2009. That had two benefits; a huge improvement in the level of service in Mexico City, and improvement in the allocation of public services, as this company was collecting $4 billion in subsidies every year. One of the biggest challenges Mexico faces is to improve the quality of spending, especially in terms of energy subsidies, which also contribute to global warming, an issue we should be fighting. Fixing these issues will make the country much more attractive.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the creation of du, and what were the challenges to entering the market?</h4><p>The creation of du was the first step in opening up the telecommunications sector in the UAE to competition. It was the first time in UAE telecom history that the market was opened up to secondary players after 100% penetration had been attained in the mobile segment. That, in itself, was a great challenge. Another challenge we faced was that it was the first time that a telecoms start-up was offering the full range of telecoms services right away. Usually, start-ups begin with only mobile voice services and then move on to offer fixed broadband services and so on. From the very beginning, we had a mandate to offer services in mobile, fixed telecoms, fixed broadband, home TV services, IP TV services, and broadcasting. That was a very exciting challenge. The third challenge, and probably the most important, was that this is the first telecom start-up in the Arab world that was created without support from an existing and established operator.</p><h4>What have been the most instrumental factors in the exponential growth the company has witnessed in its short five-year history?</h4><p>We should be very proud of what we have achieved in just five years of launching our services. Today, we are a company that has a significant market share in the mobile sector in the UAE—over 46% in the most penetrated market in the world for mobile services is remarkable by any standards. We are now getting close to having 6 million active mobile customers. We have managed to reach close to AED9 billion in revenues in 2011. We have very good profit margins, as evidenced by our ability, in such a short period, to distribute our first dividend to our shareholders just five years after launching the service. We are very proud of these results, of our position in the market, the value created for our shareholders, and the pool of talented people that we have. We worked hard to get this talent onboard and create a strong corporate culture, and today I believe that we have one of the strongest brands within the Arab world. We have excellent infrastructure. Our mobile broadband network has recently been ranked the best in all of Africa and the Middle East. We also have solid foundations in our governance. We are so very passionate about the brand, which is not just about having a nice logo or campaigns; the brand is about everything that this company lives and breathes interfacing with its customers, employees, and shareholders.</p><div class="quote">“The creation of du was the first step in opening up the telecommunications sector in the UAE to competition."</div><h4>What trends have you seen in the growth of mobile data in the UAE, and what percentage of total revenue does mobile data comprise at the moment?</h4><p>Today, data revenues represent about 15% of our revenues. I expect that in the coming five years it will exceed 30% or 40%. Less than 20 years ago mobile telecommunications empowered the concept of mobility that transformed completely almost everything we do. Mobile data and broadband capabilities added a completely new dimension. It came with incredible power; the power of the internet, the power of new freedom, of enjoyment, of efficiency, and of prosperity, especially in emerging economies. Now, we are contemplating the moment when, in just a few years, the number of mobile devices will be higher than the number of human beings on this planet. The internet itself was a breakthrough, and later gave birth to social networking. I strongly believe that being connected is a basic human right. It is an idea that I am passionate about.</p><h4>Broadband internet in the UAE is still working on becoming more competitive in terms of speed and cost. How do you see this evolving?</h4><p>In terms of speed, I think that broadband internet in the UAE is already very competitive. The UAE will probably be one of the first countries in the world to have fibre-optic cables running into all homes and offices. In terms of cost, things have evolved a lot, especially in the residential market over the last three years, driven by competition. However, fixed broadband for businesses probably needs to see some more attention. It is becoming more competitive, though. All over the world, telecoms operators are looking at how to price it properly. I think that enterprise customers are willing to pay for a premium service. Capacity is going to become more vital. This is why we are going to spend billions investing in the right infrastructure.</p><h4>Looking at the UAE as a hub for potential innovation in the IT market, how is du leading the way?</h4><p>The idea of the UAE as a hub is a very important one. Things evolve, and depending on the pace of change, you feel the progress of evolution. The UAE first became a hub for goods and merchandise in this part of the world, helped along by the right infrastructure. It then began to transform into a hub for people through the creation of the right enablers: themed free zones, tourism, airport infrastructure, airlines such as Emirates, Etihad, Air Arabia, and Fly Dubai more recently. These developments are responsible for turning the UAE into a hub for capital inflow and investments. I am convinced that the next phase will see UAE becoming a hub for the digital space. It is a natural step. This part of the world generally missed the industrial revolution of the previous two centuries. We did not create the infrastructure for big factories that could drive innovation—we were buying and using. I believe that the digital age is a great opportunity. It does not require all the infrastructure of factories and R&amp;D centres. Dubai, over the last 15 years, has been through a brainstorming process and put all the right aspects in place to attract investment flows. In the digital age, we have the opportunity to cement the UAE's place on the map. Awareness at the level of decision makers, policy makers, regulators, industrial leaders, and the community to incubate entrepreneurship could create the right ecosystem to continue attracting these flows in this digital space.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives has the Secretariat of Energy undertaken to increase long-term investment in deepwater exploration operations?</h4><p>With the objective of increasing long-term investment to take full advantage of deepwater reserves, there has been a push in our hydrocarbon exploration policy. In the last few years, investment in the exploration and production of Mexican oil has reached historic levels. Investment in PEMEX's exploration decreased more than 3% from 1990 to 2000, whilst between 2001 and 2012 it had a real growth of almost 5.4 fold. Additionally, the 2008 Energy Reform opened the door to new contracts, which together with the integral services on offer, are a fundamental part of the federal government's strategy to promote investment. PEMEX and its subsidiary organisms' business plan for the 2012-2016 period defines in detail the strategies and objectives of exploration and exploitation. Regarding deepwater reserves, the plan foresees an increase in investment of approximately 9% per year over the 2012-2026 period. Amongst the main initiatives that are being contemplated are projects in the south of the Mexican Gulf. We are looking to conclude exploration activity and start developing the Holok Poniente gas basin. We are also looking to acquire and process 3D seismic information in areas where there is a lack of data of the right quality.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the strengths of the Mexican energy sector?</h4><p>Mexico is blessed with abundant natural resources. We have important hydrocarbon reserves to the equivalent of 43.1 billion barrels of crude oil and great potential in renewable energy. For example, our country stands out as having one of the highest averages for solar radiation annually—approximately 5.2 kWh per hour per square meter every day. This is a great combination because fossil resources contribute to the financing of the energy transition toward cleaner production and more efficient energy consumption. In addition, referring to so-called transition fuel, or natural gas, Mexico has important potential resources, since, according to the US Department of Energy, the country ranks fourth worldwide for prospective shale gas reserves, with 681 trillion cubic feet technically retrievable. These natural resources, together with the responsible strategy and long-term vision that the federal government has implemented, makes the Mexican energy sector not only strong, but an engine for the development of the country. In terms of strategy, our approach is comprehensive and covers each of the sub-sectors so we can maximize their potential. For instance, we have invested Ps1.2 billion to strengthen the hydrocarbon subsector. Also, during the current administration, there has been a drive without precedence in the development of clean energy sources. This has been achieved through the participation of both the public and private sector due to regulations that give more certainty and transparency to investors. It is worth mentioning that the use of renewable energy sources translates into important economic benefits. Additionally, their use allows for the diversification of the energy mix while reducing greenhouse emissions. Another contribution of the 2008 Energy Reform was the implementation of  three funds to drive the green agenda. The objective of the funds is to boost applied scientific research, such as the adoption, innovation, assimilation, and technological development of hydrocarbon reserves, renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, clean technology, and the diversification of primary energy sources.</p><div class="quote">“The Mexican power generation sector has a unique buying model in which the CFE acquires the surplus of external energy producers."</div><h4>How is the private sector contributing to Mexico's energy generation capacity?</h4><p>Since the inauguration of Mérida III, the first generation plant under the independent power producer (IPP) scheme, the benefits of private participation have become obvious. Since then, the energy sector's structure has revamped so that the country can benefit from its hydrocarbon reserves without compromising its interests. The main advantages of private participation in power generation is cost reduction, because the official agents compete through Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) public tenders and then compete for energy clearance. This participation also translates into better technologies, which, increase operational efficiency while reducing risk. It is important not to forget that when building power generation plants for renewable energy sources, the energy mix diversifies and the energy security of the country increases. Also, the introduction of better technologies in the country arouses innovation, diffusion, and technology adoption throughout the productive chain. This, without a doubt, generates economic benefits for the country.</p><h4>What impact has the 2008 Energy Reform had on the energy sector, and what measures should be taken to improve competitiveness in the sector?</h4><p>The collection of reforms and new laws that constitute the energy reform plan were the first step in a process that has the objective of transforming the hydrocarbon sector, strengthening PEMEX, and promoting energy security in a sustainable way. The reform has had a significant impact on the energy sector's structure with relevant results, such as the strengthening of PEMEX's corporate governance through the inclusion of four board members who will be ratified by congress. Other positive results for PEMEX include the reinforcement of control mechanisms and vigilance, as well as the creation of the Transparency and Accountability Committee. PEMEX's new fiscal regime also allows it to carry out exploration—the most complex and costly of its operations—with profitability both onshore and offshore. Furthermore, the 2008 reform allows more budget flexibility. Today, there are a series of far-reaching measures to incorporate national providers and contractors into PEMEX's operations. Also, the creation of work and service contracts allows us to go for more complex and long-term projects, maintaining our commitment to the nation over hydrocarbons. The reform has resulted in clear growth in the hydrocarbon sector. For the third consecutive year, in 2011, we restored more than 100% of the total proven reserves, for which we are replacing nine of every 10 barrels. On the other hand, the first integral contracts of services for exploration and production (E&amp;P) have been put to tender in three mature fields in the southern region: Santuario, Carrizo, and Magallanes. Also, in the Gulf of Mexico, PEMEX has incorporated three times more reserves than Exxon over the last year. However, there are still important challenges, since the implementation of these reforms requires the strengthening of institutions and organisms.</p><h4>Shale gas is gaining greater attention in North America and Europe. What opportunities does Mexico have in this regard?</h4><p>Shale gas has the potential to transform the energy landscape of the country. PEMEX has estimated that shale gas resources could potentially reach 459 trillion cubic feet. It is estimated that national natural gas production, without including shale gas, will increase by an average of 0.5% annually for the next 15 years, whilst demand will increase around 2.5% per year. If we develop an integral strategy for shale gas, imports could be reduced, strengthening energy security in our country and reducing exterior energy dependence. Additionally, the exploitation of shale gas could attract between $7 billion and $10 billion of annual investment while generating around 1.3 million jobs directly and indirectly.</p><h4>In what ways is the Secretariat of Energy working to minimize the negative effects that operations in the oil sector could cause in the environment?</h4><p>During this administration the Secretariat of Energy has put special emphasis on projects and activities that promote the reduction of CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and the use of clean development mechanisms. Also, incentives for activities that protect the environment, like the best use of water in industrial processes, are on offer. As a result of mitigation efforts between 2009 and 2010, PEMEX reduced its CO2 emissions from 50.2 million tons to 45.5 million tons. For 2011 it is expected to achieve an additional reduction of 3.8 million tons of CO2. It worth pointing out that PEMEX lies within a comprehensive management system that looks at industrial security and environmental protection as the main drivers in its activities.</p><h4>The CFE is currently producing 89% of the country's domestic electricity supply. How do you see the sector evolving?</h4><p>The Mexican power generation sector has a unique buying model in which the CFE acquires the surplus of external energy producers. Article 27 of the Constitution establishes that only the state can generate, drive, transform, distribute, and supply electricity for public use. In this sense, the CFE is the only entity that can carry out this service. However, following reforms to the public electricity service law in 1992, the participation of individuals in the electricity generation sector is allowed for self consumption as an independent energy producer, or for activities that are deemed for self-sufficiency, cogeneration, and small production, as well as import and export. As of November 2011, the external energy producers supplied 32.1% of total CFE generation. These percentages reflect the development of efficient mechanisms of electricity production, giving way to combined-cycle technology.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What should be the role of multilateral organizations such as CAF in the current worldwide context of economic crisis and recession in the US and Europe?</h4><p>At a time when the global economy is going through a period of uncertainty, Latin America is still producing good results in terms of growth and macroeconomic stability, despite the external vulnerabilities of the European crisis, the slow US recovery, and the deceleration in China. This is due to a combination of factors, both external and internal, and the sensible macroeconomic policies implemented in most Latin American countries. This situation suggests major challenges for the region that require the construction of integral agendas that include four crucial issues simultaneously: macroeconomic stability, microeconomic efficiency, social equity, and environmental balance. The region must reach growth rates higher than they are currently, to allow for an accelerated productive transformation process, higher levels of investment, and a more solid level of institutionalism. In that sense, CAF assumes an important role in assisting its member states in their development strategies, not only with financing but also with knowledge and technical support, for the capitalization of a favorable implementation of an integral agenda with a long-term vision that is national as well as regional.</p><h4>What are the essential elements that both Ecuador and Latin America need for development over the medium and long term?</h4><p>Among the challenges that the region will face in this new situation, it is vital to give up the concentration on raw material exports and diversify the economy. This demands that the region doesn't fall into complacency and focuses on an ambitious agenda to overcome the structural weaknesses that it still faces. Particularly important is the productive transformation that is going on through sustained increases in productivity and profits in terms of competitiveness. In this direction, a fundamental challenge is value adding for the natural advantages that the region possesses, through technological and human capital development. Another no less important challenge is the adaptation and development of infrastructure for regional integration, in order to boost the advantages that the boom in commerce with Asia is offering. The challenge is to channel resources by increasing savings and domestic investment, as well as the intelligent raising of foreign investment. To achieve these objectives, the region must keep working on improving the business environment for the private sector and the quality of its institutions. Although the reduction of poverty is one of the biggest accomplishments that Latin America has achieved in the past years, there remain important shortcomings, mainly in terms of income distribution. In that sense, it is indispensable to work on a wide and innovative social agenda that allows for a reduction in the high inequality levels that can still be found in the region.</p><div class="quote">“Over the past few years, Ecuador and Latin America have seen positive results in terms of poverty reduction."</div><h4>What are the main objectives of widening CAF's credit portfolio and how can Ecuador benefit from this process?</h4><p>The projects promoted by CAF in Ecuador are framed inside the investment priorities established by the government in key sectors for the development of the country, looking, above all, to improve quality of life. CAF is especially aiming to strengthen the economic and social integration of the regions and social sectors that lag behind. From 2007-2011, CAF approved $4.2 billion for its operations in Ecuador; at the end of 2011 the total portfolio reached $2.5 billion, which represented around 15% of CAF's total portfolio.</p><h4>How can CAF contribute to the achievement of Latin American integration that includes social, political, cultural, and environmental aspects?</h4><p>In this stage of great challenges for the region, CAF contributes in a pragmatic way to the efforts of regional integration, conceiving it as a decisive factor for the achievement of a relevant presence in the global economic and political context. The institution is one of the largest multilateral financing sources in Latin America today, and has a special emphasis on projects that promote regional integration. Its integral agenda for sustainable development aims at achieving a high growth rate that respects cultural diversity and the environment. These are indispensable conditions when facing collective regional challenges and problems with coherence and clarity. CAF's approvals in favor of Latin America over the last five-year period reached $45 billion. In 2011, approvals worth more than $10 billion were directed to financing economic and integration infrastructure (50%), social and environmental development (30%), and the productive sectors (20%). This integrated vision of development translates into complementary activities to our financial work, aligned with the objective of generating knowledge to provide technical support and contribute to the institutional strengthening of its member states.</p><h4>What is your opinion about the efforts made by Ecuador to reduce poverty levels?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Ecuador and Latin America have seen positive results in terms of poverty reduction, due to their favorable economic performance. These advances make it imperative to continue working on a wide and innovative social agenda that allows for deepened integration.</p><h4>What strategies do you intend to implement in 2012 to promote productive activity and support SMEs in Ecuador?</h4><p>CAF's contribution to SMEs is through projects that help promote sectorial development and competitiveness, and at the same time promote export diversification and generate direct and indirect employment in rural communities that fall below the regional poverty line. An example of this in Ecuador is the creation of competitive advantages for the development of SMEs in Cuenca. This will strengthen the electrical appliance and furniture industries, which bring together a significant amount of developing companies, by articulating work between the national and local government, the entrepreneurial sector, and the academic sector of the city.</p><h4>How does CAF support the regional capital market development?</h4><p>Latin American economies have developed their capital markets and adopted regulatory frameworks that include corporate governance best practices, which are factors promoting stock market development. Good corporate governance helps companies to operate at higher efficiency levels, attract capital, and protect themselves from corruption and bad management. This practice makes companies become more responsible and transparent, and reinforces investor trust in public and private enterprises. Fulfilling our commitment to sustainable development and regional integration, CAF has been promoting the Program of Corporate Governance, destined to promote best practice throughout the region. Through the promotion of best practices we look to contribute to responsible competitiveness at a company, sectorial, and macroeconomic level.</p><h4>How does CAF plan to facilitate the development of the stock market in Ecuador?</h4><p>The CAF support policy for stock market development is framed by regional integration and market efficiency, by supporting its country members in the creation of public policies, as well as their formalization and implementation. CAF, together with the Quito Stock Exchange and with the institutional sponsorship of the Financial Analysis Unit, recently presented a report generated by a project on the modernization of stock markets and the prevention of money laundering. To conduct this study, prominent national and foreign consultants were selected who carried out research into the laws of different markets and the practices and reports demanded by financial intelligence entities. On this basis, two documents were elaborated as references in the prevention of money laundering for the stock market. Additionally, CAF has promoted other projects in Ecuador to modernize the stock market such as the creation of the Corporate Governance Academic Unit, with the objective of deepening stock market development through the implementation of processes and mechanisms that improve efficiency and effectiveness as well as generate investor trust. The program has also allowed for the creation of an academic network supporting good corporate governance and the promotion of a stock market culture.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the defining characteristics of the banking industry in 2011?</h4><p>We were faced with a number of challenging issues throughout 2011. However, by facing those challenges, we managed to equip ourselves with a mechanism to greatly improve our internal control system and restructure the organization with a focus on our clients. It also helped us to put more of an emphasis on corporate governance rather than just focusing on growth. That was a great opportunity for us; every change strengthens you and makes you healthier with respect to the competition. It really was a year of change.</p><h4>How can these challenges be turned into growth opportunities?</h4><p>We turned the challenges into an educational process; you must constantly study the changes that are happening to the market and its legal framework and learn from it. Then you implement a system, in order for your organization to weather it with minimum loss. That's how we develop and educate ourselves. This has helped us to strengthen our internal procedures and it was educational in terms of restructuring our organization to be more agile, and to be more responsive to the challenges of the market more dynamically. When you live in a routine with few challenges, you get used to what you are doing. But when you face a challenge, you start thinking. When you get through the challenges successfully, you get to know the team better, find better solutions, and start thinking out of the box. What is better than that for an organization? Two years ago, when we developed our five-year strategic plan, we segmented it into three phases in terms of our focus: growth, internal procedures, and more growth. In 2011, our clients ranked us number one with respect to the loyalty index measured on a quarterly basis, and our deposits grew more than 39%, which was basically a record for the market. We started segmenting our clients into retail, premier, private, and corporate banking. By having a corporate banking unit, we achieved two aims: offering better services to our corporate clients, and concentrating all the large exposures of the bank into one business unit in order to better measure and supervise credit risk. Corporate banking involves not only dealing with lending, but also a comprehensive and A-Z client service. Our risks are now controlled much better and we are overwhelmed by new clients' requests, giving us the luxury of selection by running a “know your customer" (KYC) procedure at the international level. Our focus on retail banking is with a view on e-banking services, based on our historic achievement. Therefore, we are not focusing on growing the number of branches, rather we focus on increasing the number of retail clients by offering them the ease of use of e-banking services (on the transactional side), and utilizing the branches mainly for the purpose of offering new products and alternative banking solutions. By taking this direction, our client base has increased by 50% over the past two years. By implementing our CRM system, we now know the gender of each client, the category, their income, how and where they live, and basically their demography. That has helped us to introduce some new services customized to our customers' needs. In 2011, we also managed to successfully raise our capital to the new regulation stated by the Central Bank of Iran.</p><h4>Saman Bank introduced e-banking to the Iranian market. How would you assess the quality of this service and how do you create a competitive edge?</h4><p>We blend. We have access to an international knowledge base, especially in terms of e-banking products and services, and we customize them to our own needs. We mainly develop the applications ourselves. Our new website will be launched in late June and we implemented a new internet banking service in 2011 named “Saman NetBank." If you compare Saman NetBank with the internet services from other banks, you can tell the difference yourself. The usability, the interface, and the user-friendliness of the menus and toolbars are totally different from what people have experienced before in this market. And this was achieved just by bringing over the knowledge and customizing it to our own needs and culture. A local fund transfer is a very vivid example of this because the need in this market is repeat transfers to relatives, small businesses, or partners. We have a group transfer system, where you can transfer from one to many accounts. It allows timed transfers and automatic daily transfers, and these are what our customers need from us. In mid-June we are going to launch our new mobile banking, with a new brand name called “Samanak." We are the only bank that has apps in Apple stores and for Android, which can also work with SMS or GPRS, as well as switch between the two platforms when the coverage of either is not available. Saman Bank works with many internationally recognized experts in the e-banking field to maintain the quality of service.</p><div class="quote">“Saman Bank works with many internationally recognized experts in the e-banking field to maintain the quality of service."</div><h4>In which financial sector are there opportunities for you to grow and what new financial services can be introduced in the market?</h4><p>First of all, we are going to launch our new brand and logo. Other than that, we believe that SMEs and retail are the two markets where the risk is relatively lower, and they have not been developing greatly in this market. Everybody is after major clients, but in this society small communities matter a lot and we have a beautiful culture with respect to helping each other when in need: for that, there are few banking services available. I'm not talking about micro financing; I'm talking about communities of 10, 20, or 50 people living on the same street or neighborhood. They sit down, talk, and establish small funds in which everybody participates with a small amount, and they lend the money when in need to a member. These small funds are not regulated, and they are not supervised by any bank because it is community-based action built on trust. We are working on offering a product specifically for this market and establishing small funds for these communities. They will be able to open an account with us and transfer their funds on a monthly basis, or by using whatever mechanism they agreed upon among their community. We would like to participate in some of the successful funds by adding more funds at a preferred rate, because the whole transaction is within the bank and we can track the pattern. This is not microfinance, it's community lending—and it makes our bank different from the others in the market. On the SME side, we are focusing on small shops and businesses by offering point-of-sale (POS) terminals. By installing them we can see the pattern of their sales, and the level of revenues they generate, and subsequently design a product for them.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Iranian economy going forward to 2013?</h4><p>In corporate banking, our only focus would be on facilitating and financing food commodities and pharmaceutical products, as well as working capital financing. On the retail side, we will focus more on offering credit cards with the use of our newly implemented scoring system. SME lending is fairly successful for us, especially with merchants that use our POS terminals. Moreover, on the SME side, we maintain our focus on brokerage firms that participate in both the stock and commodity markets. This growth is driven by the development of the stock market and it's becoming deeper and deeper with respect to volume, value, and frequency of transactions in those markets; the participants are becoming more sophisticated, they require a variety of services, and we offer specialized services to brokers especially. We will try to stay on the edge and specialize even more in e-banking and international banking.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights of Unilever's experience in 2011, and how can this market be compared to the complexity of Unilever's operations in the region?</h4><p>I cover Unilever's operations from Kazakhstan to Cyprus, and Iran joined this group in 2007. This is a rather complicated geography and each country has its own difficulties. That is why we aim to truly understand how to operate in each country. We can be flexible as long as Unilever's Code of Business Principles is strictly adhered to. Despite having a somewhat more complicated bureaucracy, we are very comfortable in Iran. It is a rewarding challenge to understand the country, the consumers, and how the market operates. I came here in 2007 and with my Sales Director I travelled throughout the country several times to better understand local consumers, their shopping habits, and the trade structure. This contributed significantly to our plans, which turned the business around to deliver profitable and sustainable growth since 2009.</p><h4>Over the past six years, how has the Iranian market changed and what trends have you observed with respect to the goods you are introducing to the local market?</h4><p>The Iranian consumer is very conscious of the price-quality relationship, and they are ready to pay more for higher quality goods. Something produced abroad cannot simply be sold at any price—you have to deliver the right quality consistently. Iran has a very experienced and competitive industry in consumer goods. I can quantify the improvement in quality and the marketing skills of local businesses over the past five years. The quality of packaging has also become world class compared to other Central Asian states. Iran has a long history of trade and industry, and competition is welcomed and even encouraged. I believe the presence of multinationals not only accelerates market growth, but also the development of the local competition.</p><div class="quote">“The food segment here is much more advanced than anywhere else in the region."</div><h4>How do you customize international brands and products to suit this unique market?</h4><p>We separate our goods into two categories: foods and home and personal care. The need for the customization of products in the second category is minimal. The same toothpaste, shampoo, or deodorant can serve the needs of the people in Korea, Iran, or Kazakhstan. However, this is less valid in the case of foods. When we launched Knorr, we developed seven different kinds of soups only for the Iranian market after months of consumer research and development. They are totally different from the soups we offer in Turkey.</p><h4>What strengths and weaknesses are you observing in the Iranian food industry?</h4><p>I see strengths, especially in the ice-cream segment. There are excellent ice-cream products; three or four local companies produce delicious ice cream at unbelievably low prices, and we are thinking about partnerships or acquisitions with these companies. The food segment here is much more advanced than anywhere else in the region.</p><h4>What are the strategies are you putting in place to handle the tough competition and meet consumer demand?</h4><p>We haven't perfected our strategy yet. We have a long way to go in terms of soups and bouillon, and it's hard to compete with the local producers by importing because the margins aren't huge. Partnership with local ice-cream producers could be one choice, but the market is fairly saturated and it would be a very costly battle. We aim to focus more on the home and personal care areas.</p><h4>How will you improve the presence of your personal and home care products?</h4><p>We are confident in the quality of all our products. I know it sounds cliché, but what we've been doing so far is proof of that. Unilever researches heavily and its products are well known; Iranians are aware of what's happening outside the country. The brands are known and the product is good, and we discovered how to bring the product to the consumer. On a weekly basis, we support 28 distributors operating 65,000 outlets throughout Iran. For a product such as body deodorant, there are no local competitors and people are eager to try new and different things. For home detergents, it is different; it is very expensive to import the products and we are thinking about investing locally. However, we believe in the quality of our products, and we are heavily investing and looking at the long term. We use ads and television to promote our products in order to establish our brands; our support budget this year was ‚¬15 million. Unilever will continue to invest as much as is necessary to establish our brands; growth is our priority, while profitability comes later.</p><h4>Which of your products is the most popular for the average Iranian consumer?</h4><p>Oils, deodorants, and shampoos are widely popular. Product sales in these categories have been growing steadily by 50% for the last four years. I believe that Iranians appreciate the quality of these products.</p><h4>What is your evaluation on the openness of the Iranian market with respect to international products and investors?</h4><p>I believe that the market should be more open. My advice would be to let there be competition. In terms of products, our prices are three times more expensive than the local variant, but we offer higher quality. There must be room for local producers to increase quality as well. I don't mind the exchange rate difference, but I am interested in investing more and increasing quality. I'm optimistic; I think that by the end of 2012 there will be more market activity.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your Vision 2030 aims to create an integrated and universal healthcare system, granting access to all Mexicans. What strategy has been implemented by your Ministry to achieve the goals expressed in your long-term plan?</h4><p>The path toward an integrated healthcare system starts with the consolidation of universal coverage so that all Mexicans have guaranteed equal access to high-quality services, regardless of their labor status. This will be a reality in 2012. Additionally, we have worked with the social security institutions to develop clinical guidelines, a single-cost methodology underpinning exchange prices, electronic files in each institution with common characteristics, and a sectorial framework for exchanging services that facilitate the optimal use of public infrastructure through specific agreements in each of the 32 federal entities. There are also general exchange frameworks in operation, such as one concerning obstetric emergencies. Consolidating these efforts will allow for a comprehensive integration of the healthcare system.</p><h4>What strengths would you identify in Mexico's healthcare system, especially in terms of infrastructure and human capital quality?</h4><p>During this administration, Mexico has made significant efforts to expand and consolidate its infrastructure. We are proud of our human resources and can confirm that a great number of our doctors are considered globally competitive. Additionally we have regularized over 70,000 workers to guarantee that our staff have the best possible working conditions.</p><div class="quote">“We are proud of our human resources and can confirm that a great number of our doctors are considered globally competitive."</div><h4>How do you strike a balance between dedication to quality standards, pragmatism, and budgetary concerns?</h4><p>We are proud to inform that the budget for the healthcare sector has been constantly increasing since 2004, particularly with the introduction of the social protection system, Seguro Popular. As a result, health care currently composes almost 7% of GDP. While this is a historical effort, we are still facing challenges in terms of achieving the best use of our resources. Quality is extremely important to obtain real benefits from these efforts, and will be constantly improved upon. We are thus developing and implementing clinical guidelines as well as guaranteeing evidence-based medicine.</p><h4>How significant is nanotechnology in Mexico's healthcare sector?</h4><p>Nanotechnology is very relevant for the healthcare sector. Promising results in new molecular diagnose systems such as nanorays, nanopharmaceuticals, cell therapy and tissue regeneration, and nanobiomimetics are key areas in which to conduct medical R&amp;D in the future.</p><h4>What are Mexico's strengths in terms of clinical research?</h4><p>Mexico has 10 national health institutes devoted to medical education, research, and excellence in health care, which comprises the network of public clinics and hospitals across the country. These institutes contribute to R&amp;D in collaboration with public universities. Over 70% of clinical trials occur in public medical units, which is a direct result of our human resource training.</p><h4>How has your Ministry worked to create a legal framework that allows the participation of the private sector in the health system of Mexico?</h4><p>The best use of resources has sometimes meant that public health institutions could provide service to more patients if they outsource certain services to the private sector. While the federal and local governments are fully responsible for providing health care to the entire population, a variety of services are sometimes bought from private institutions in order to obtain the best possible results. This is completely acceptable with our current legal framework, and remains a possibility.</p><h4>Mexico ranks first in obesity globally. How is your Ministry working to reduce the impact of this chronic disease?</h4><p>A variety of actions have been taken to reduce obesity and its impact. We are promoting care through specialized health clinics offering a multidisciplinary approach, consolidating prevention campaigns through public media and focusing on children, in an effort to promote healthier nutrition in schools. Our aim for healthier life choices has started with the available information regarding chronic diseases and their impact. Significant efforts are being made to consolidate preventive actions with the support of organizations such as Consulta Segura, PrevenIMSS, and PrevenISSSTE, as well as teaching the key skills for healthier life choices.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the generics market in Mexico, taking into account the current income levels of Mexicans? How is your Ministry ensuring that access to medicines and medical attention is affordable?</h4><p>Mexico invests much of its resources in medicines, more than similar income countries or our commercial partners in some cases. This effort is necessary to ensure that the best possible pharmaceutical alternatives reach the population. When this is not the case, we are working hard to promote a strong bioequivalent generic market so that medicines are more affordable. Since October 2011, we have accelerated the process to provide pharmaceutical registries for medicines that compete with those that recently lost their patent. This particular action has resulted in around $76 million worth of savings per year, allowing us to treat more patients with the same budget. The impact of this administrative effort has been fairly surprising, and pushes innovator prices down by 50%. Our key challenge is to decrease our out-of-pocket expenditure through fully accessible public services, including free medical attention and medicines.</p><h4>What is your specific strategy to ensure healthcare access in the remote areas of the country?</h4><p>We have taken several actions to provide health care in remote areas, including the installation of mobile units that reach even the most remote communities where over 3.5 million Mexicans live. These small locations would not otherwise have permanent health units due to their size. Additionally, we work together with the Opportunities Program to guarantee that health is a pillar toward social development as a whole in most rural areas.</p><h4>What structural reforms should be implemented to improve the public healthcare sector in Mexico?</h4><p>The main long-term structural reform regarding health care is a transition toward general tax funding. This would be the last step of our integration-universalization process, and would imply that all Mexicans have equal access to equal services. Our current effort to guarantee coverage and financing is the first step toward equal spending per capita, but the process will be completed when there are no differences in amount or source.</p><h4>In which ways can a high€level health system boost the performance of the Mexico's economy as a whole?</h4><p>It has been proven that over one-third of long-term growth can be associated with better health. We are certain that our current investment and efforts will encourage a healthier and more productive workforce that will contribute to overall economic and social development. However, it is not a matter of performance, but a matter of being committed to a comprehensive, high-quality, and sustainable healthcare system for all Mexicans regardless of income or labor status.</p><h4>What is your outlook beyond 2012 for the health sector?</h4><p>The Mexican health sector will achieve universal coverage and higher quality standards through a better use of resources and a comprehensive understanding of the permanent right to health care. Those are the milestones for the creation of a universal healthcare system, based on a wide social protection approach.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Cinépolis is a leader in the film industry across more than 10 countries around the world. What organizational strengths have helped you to achieve this strong international presence?</h4><p>I think that the most important part of an organization is its people. We have put a lot of emphasis on attracting talent to the organization, motivating our workforce, and giving our employees good incentives. I think that the most important component necessary to be able to expand internationally is the executive team. Also, the robustness of our organization in Mexico and the fact that we are the market leader has allowed us to start exploring markets outside of the country. Since we have been the market leader for quite a long time, and because the Mexican market has been maturing, we have been able to expand into other countries. Another organizational strength is the ability to be present internationally with a very standardized operation. That has allowed us to replicate our business model successfully outside of Mexico. We have standardized processes that allow us to do that. We have invested a lot in IT. We are present in 11 countries, including the US, China, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and India.</p><h4>What is your strategy for continued international expansion?</h4><p>Our strategy for now is to focus on the markets where we are already present, develop them further, and gain market share. We want to focus mainly on two large markets: Brazil and India. Those are markets where we have enough room to grow for many years. Also, Colombia and Peru are interesting markets in which to continue growing. In the US, our strategy for growth is exclusively directed toward the luxury cinema niche. We are only in that segment. We will not open traditional cinemas; we are only going for the upscale market.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategy for now is to focus on the markets where we are already present, develop them further, and gain market share."</div><h4>As a promoter of the Morelia International Film Festival, how was 2011, and what are your expectations for 2012?</h4><p>We are very happy because in 2012 we are celebrating our 10th anniversary. Morelia is a small festival that has grown without losing its essence and quality. I think the whole mark of the Morelia International Film Festival is the high quality of all the content we select. The official selection goes through a very rigorous process. Also, we always invite special guests, carry out interesting retrospectives, and provide an important platform for young Mexican filmmakers. That is the mission of the Morelia Film Festival. I think the ninth show in 2011 was very good, but then again I think every year it gets better and better. We have hosted some of the most important filmmakers of the recent past, including Steven Soderbergh, Werner Herzog, Gus Van Sant, and Quentin Tarantino. In 2011 we had Béla Tarr and Volker Schlöndorff. In addition Todd Haynes, Stephen Frears, Bertrand Tavernier, Alejandro González Iñárritu, and Alfonso Cuarón were in attendance. There are too many to mention. We have had over 10 winners of the Palme d'Or, which is not an easy thing for such a young festival. We have never gone for size; we have always gone for quality. I think the essence of a good festival is being a little bit more compact in a city that lends itself to a nice festival.</p><h4>You will be the first Latin American entrepreneur to be co-president of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. How do you plan to represent Mexico internationally in this specific forum?</h4><p>I think the role of the co-chairs of Davos is to help develop the agenda prior to the meeting and then utilize the closing session to present some of the conclusions of the forum. In 2012, the forum is focused on shaping new models. Given the huge transformations we have been seeing in the world over the last year or so, and especially in 2011 with the huge social movements such as the Arab spring and Occupy Wall Street, in a way, citizens are becoming more empowered by connectivity technologies. In many of these countries the media was censored in the past, and people were not able to easily know what was happening around them. But through social networks they became reporters, played a part in what was happening around the country, and started mobilizing. That is how they were able to topple a number of dictatorships. I think that is a good example of how connectivity technology can empower people. Also, the Occupy Wall Street movement shows that citizens are not willing to just be passive observers, but that they want to be actively involved in what both financial and political leaders decide. In that light, the theme of 2012 is to try to find not only economic and political models, but models of participation as well. There is going to be a lot of debate about this. Of course, one thing that will be very present on the agenda is the continuing debt crisis in Europe, as it has not been fully solved.</p><h4>What led you to get involved in the documentary De Panzazo?</h4><p>This film is being produced by an organization that I am actively involved in, Mexicanos Primeros. It is an organization of which I am a vice-chair, and was founded with a number of friends—young businessmen mainly—five years ago. The goal of this organization is to promote educational reform in Mexico. One of the biggest problems in our country is the low quality of education. Among all OECD countries, we have systematically ranked last. There have been some small advances, a bit of progress in the recent past, but the progress is not enough to catch up to the rest of the world. If we want Mexico to be a competitive nation in the future and to be able to increase economic growth in order to solve many of its social problems, we need to increase the quantity and quality of education. We need more years of schooling, but we need a better quality of education during those years. Da Panzazo is a documentary being made to highlight the problem. We don't blame just one part of the whole equation. We do not blame the government or the teachers' union. We think we all have a responsibility to play in transforming education in Mexico, and the film shows that unless we take an active role in transforming the sector we will lag even further behind. Cinépolis is going to distribute the film. It is a documentary with an important social cause and we are going to distribute it for free.</p><h4>How would you assess the current development of the Mexican cinema industry?</h4><p>The Mexican film industry has been growing in recent years. As a nation, we have been producing between 60 and 70 feature films every year. That is already a good number. A number of these films do well at the box office. From 2010 to 2011, the number of admissions to Mexican films grew by about 18%, and this shows that there is a growing appetite for them. It still, however, accounts only for a relatively minor share of the total box office in Mexico. It is still very low, but at least it is on the right track. There have been some Mexican fiscal incentives to invest in films that have helped the rebirth of the Mexican film industry. Some years ago it was almost dying, producing just five or six films a year. We are now back to 70. Now that we have a lot of production, we should focus on how to raise the quality of those productions so that Mexican films are more successful inside Mexico, because that is the prerequisite for them to be successful outside of Mexico.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the competitive strengths of your firm's legal practice in Turkey?</h4><p>Paksoy is one of the leading independent law firms in Turkey and enjoys an extensive competitive edge over its rivals through its excellent reputation, strong relationship with clients and regulators, and its vast experience in a broad array of legal issues related to foreign investment transactions. The firm has over 40 fee earners, along with experienced senior partners and members who have the skill and ability to deliver robust, creative, and result-oriented advice to clients. A solid testimony to its transactional capabilities is Paksoy's representation of high-profile investors in big-ticket, cross-border transactions since its inception in 1997. With an excellent track record, extensive resources, tenacity, and organizational skills, Paksoy has proven its ability as a full-service law firm to provide advice in a broad range of sectors and issues, acting as a one-stop shop for its clients as a result of its diversified practice groups from corporate and M&amp;A, employment, energy, infrastructure, finance, regulatory issues, competition, securities, tax, and dispute resolution. Our experienced team of lawyers with in-depth knowledge and hands-on capability in various sectors, including financial services, energy, tax, and securities, are able to provide the best know-how and legal solutions for complex transactions.</p><h4>What have been some of the flagship transactions your firm has been involved in?</h4><p>We have acted for many high-profile and complex transactions in a wide spectrum, some of which have been extensively covered in the international media. These include Amgen's acquisition of a controlling stake in Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals in a competitive tender process worth $700 million; Turkish PE Turkven's acquisition of a 50% stake in Koton, a leading Turkish textile retailer with over 300 outlets; and US Dow Chemical's major joint venture planned in carbon-fiber production with an investment worth $1 billion. In the financial arena we acted for US insurance giant MetLife in its acquisition of a controlling stake in Deniz Emeklilik, a Turkish pension company, in a competitive process worth ‚¬162 million; the first direct Eurobond offering from a Turkish bank, Akbank; a 144A and Reg S $500 million 5.75% five-year Eurobond offering from VakıfBank, the first ever senior unsecured bond offering from a deposit-taking state bank; a Reg S sukuk offering from Kuveyt Türk, a participation bank, which marks the first ever sukuk offering from a Turkish entity; ArcelorMittal's sale of shares and a series of warrants in respect of shares in the Turkish steelmaker Erdemir by way of an offering; and Citigroup's sale of a 10% stake in Akbank, off the exchange.</p><h4>What are the strengths and challenges of Turkey's regulatory environment for foreign investment?</h4><p>In the last decade, Turkey has adopted an investor-friendly attitude to all foreign and domestic businesses, having ratified several significant regulatory changes, such as the liberalization of markets, while easing red tape, formalities, and procedures in setting up companies as well as improving corporate governance standards. The Turkish government and regulators of various sectors including telecommunications, media, securities, and banking enacted significant regulations to ensure and oversee a reliable, transparent, and efficient market for investors. These were very positive steps taken along the way by Turkish lawmakers and watchdogs, to improve the country's legal, tax, and regulatory framework in a vast array of sectors, thus facilitating an investment environment aligned with EU standards. Therefore, since the early 2000s, we have witnessed an increasing flow of foreign investment in grand capacities in almost every sector, creating a substantial business potential parallel to Turkey's economic growth average of 5%. Turkey's business performance stands out in its region and the world at large, while financial crises continue to constitute a serious threat to world economies including the US and EU member states, which are Turkey's major trading partners.</p><h4>What regulatory changes are we likely to see over the medium term?</h4><p>A major overhaul of the Turkish commercial law regime including corporate governance standards, significant audit and reporting requirements, disclosure obligations, liability issues, and efficient board and management structures has recently been promulgated in two main pieces of legislation—the Commercial Code and the Capital Markets Law—that affect both private and listed entities and the securities market in the country. This legislation is expected to further improve the legal and regulatory framework, while adding momentum to an already vibrant climate in the market.</p><div class="quote">“In the last decade, Turkey has adopted an investor-friendly attitude to all foreign and domestic businesses."</div><h4>What are the primary legal considerations for taking a company public in Turkey?</h4><p>Before a joint-stock company decides to go public, it should understand and be aware of the dimensions of the securities law environment designed to protect investors and ensure the effectiveness of the capital markets. Public companies are required to comply with, for example, disclosure requirements and better corporate governance rules, such as the appointment of independent directors. All capital market instruments, including share certificates to be issued or offered to the public, are required to be registered with the capital markets regulator. Unlike other jurisdictions, the only exemption to the registration rule is the issuance of capital market instruments by government entities. Offering rules vary based on the type of securities offered. As a general rule, however, while it is mandatory to prepare offering circular-type disclosure documents for public offerings, it is not mandatory to prepare a disclosure document for private placements or offerings targeting qualified institutional investors. The companies planning to go public should also consider the listing requirements of the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). While some public offering preconditions are eased by the Capital Markets Board, the listing requirements remain the same and should be taken into account before taking any action.</p><h4>What is your outlook for M&amp;A activity in Turkey?</h4><p>The first half of 2012 has proven to be very positive with increasing activity in M&amp;A despite the financial and political predicament in eurozone countries, including Turkey's main trading partners, such as Greece, Italy, and Spain. I expect more M&amp;A activity by private equity and strategic investors from all over the globe, and particularly from countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, in the second half of the year, with incrementally more of a focus on energy, infrastructure, financial services, and retail.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does tourism play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>Ecuador offers a unique lifestyle model that is gathering worldwide recognition. In a time of economic contraction in many countries around the world, people are questioning the traditional economic model. French philosopher Edgar Morin recently declared Ecuador an alternative model of socioeconomic development in the world. Tourism obviously plays a key role in this development. Simon Bolí­var declared that people from Latin America were a new race, for it is a continent with wide diversity in terms of culture and population, with the highest rate of biodiversity per capita in the world. For that reason, Ecuador has developed a new slogan; “Ecuador loves life!" It is a proposal for a new civilization, a new human age, in which love and the defense of life are the key elements of society. These ideals underline our tourism industry, as the country seeks to be an example to the world by developing a conscientious tourism. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) talks about three types of tourism: ethical, responsible, and sustainable. Conscious tourism brings together these three elements, but goes one step further in terms of loving life and becoming better human beings at both ends of the service chain. For example, the Ecuadorean people decided through a popular referendum that casinos have no place in a strong society, and therefore this is a casino-free country. For all these reasons, Quito will host the next WTO Congress on Ethical Tourism in September 2012, as well as a meeting of the ministers of tourism organized by the Organization of American States (OAS). The government of Ecuador aims to promote tourism as a key instrument for the development of the country, for we have a rich and wide touristic heritage that summarizes what Latin America is: the Brazilian jungles, the Peruvian and Chilean mountain ranges, Mexican and Guatemalan indigenous markets, the Caribbean coast, and, of course, the origin of the evolution of species; the Galapagos Islands. Ecuador and its tourism sector are already attracting worldwide interest. For example, investors from Qatar have already visited the country in order to implement large projects in Ecuador. Our country is aiming to develop a sustainable, ethical, responsible, and conscious tourism model.</p><h4>How has the sector evolved over recent years?</h4><p>Ecuador has only developed 15% of its tourism potential in the last few years; therefore, there is plenty left to be discovered. At the moment, we are building up a tourism brand that is attracting more interest throughout the world every day. Such a process has enabled us to experience important growth rates at a sustainable and responsible pace. We do not aim to grow for the sake of growing. For example, in the first quarter of 2012, tourism in Ecuador grew by 15%, whereas the rest of the world grew by 4.5% on average. For that reason, I believe Ecuador offers the best competitive advantages for foreign investors right now. Our country currently offers 12 touristic products such as cultural tourism, eco-tourism, sun and beach tourism, medical tourism, and even retirement tourism, which has grown considerably in the last few years, thanks partly to Ecuador being voted the best place to live in the world, in a poll carried out by International Living Magazine, security, health care accessibility, and the beautiful weather. In addition, the US Tour Operators Association (USTOA) ranked Ecuador as the third most important new destination to be discovered within the tourism sector. I would also like to say that there is  still a long road ahead of us; we need to learn a lot in terms of training and capacity. However, I truly believe that the events we are hosting here in September 2012 will help us to take a step forward in these fields. Finally, I would also like to mention that we are promoting tourism agreements with our neighbors Colombia and Peru, as well as Cuba, to implement tourism routes involving all four countries.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador has only developed 15% of its tourism potential in the last few years; therefore, there is plenty left to be discovered."</div><h4>What strategies is the Ministry implementing in order to attract FDI?</h4><p>We personally invite private businessmen over here, so they can experience first-hand what Ecuador offers. Apart from Qatari investors, we have welcomed delegations from Singapore and other Middle Eastern countries. At the same time, we are inviting large international multinationals to come over and develop large projects in our rich territory. The Ministry of Tourism has increased its budget 10 fold in the last six to seven years, which proves the increasing international exposure of our country. We are aiming to conclude business agreements with airlines, large international businesses, and also anybody interested in investing in the tourism sector in Ecuador, which offers a high return over the medium to long term, and a great sector growth margin. Ecuador is a unique country in the world, and as one of our last campaign slogans remarks, we are the Best of South America.</p><h4>Is Ecuador also looking into business and MICE tourism?</h4><p>Definitely. This is a segment we are very interested in strengthening in the near future in our country. At the moment, two convention centers are being built in Quito and Guayaquil, and Ecuador is hosting a number of important conventions and conferences in 2012. As for business tourism, this is a segment that has considerably grown at the Latin American level, and as we keep attracting foreign investment into our country, this type of tourism will also continue grow. In fact, the business segment experienced the most important growth during the first quarter of 2012.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the tourism sector in 2012?</h4><p>This is going to be a very important year for the tourism industry in Ecuador. There are private projects in the sector worth $600 million, and an airport project in Manta, which could become the most important transcontinental infrastructure in the region; an open door into the region for Asian countries. We are also developing the most spectacular journey by train—the Quito-Guayaquil route—that will be inaugurated at the end of 2012, and even boast a steam train like the Orient Express. Investment in this project is around $300 million. Our growth predictions for 2012 were around 7%-8%, and we closed the first quarter of the year with 15% growth, a prelude of the importance of 2012 for the sector. In terms of markets, we are focusing on increasing the number of visitors from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and especially Brazil, because at the moment there are no direct flights between the countries, and we are currently holding talks with different airlines to establish direct flights. This will also be an important year to open Asian markets for Ecuador.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market factors led to the establishment of Ivanhoe Energy in Ecuador in 2008?</h4><p>In 2008, Ivanhoe Energy Ecuador (IEE) signed a contract with Petroecuador to develop Block 20 of the Pungarayacu oil field. Block 20 is a major heavy oil field some 1,102 square kilometers in size, located approximately 180 kilometers southeast of Quito. During the first stage of the contract, it is mandatory for a company to conduct an exploration program, engineering work, and research in order to prepare a development plan for a block. Once we hand in our proposal, it should be reviewed and approved by EP Petroecuador, the national oil company, and then we may begin exploitation of the field. Recently, EP Petroecuador approved, as part of the appraisal stage, drilling a new well in the pre-cretaceous reservoirs, which is part of our contract with the state. If we are successful in exploring and exploiting this new well, I believe that Ecuador will enter a new phase of major oil development. IEE is taking this risk with full knowledge of the complexity of these unknown reservoirs, as part of the company's commitment to its project in the country.</p><h4>What are your production prospects for the Block 20 field?</h4><p>To date, we have carried out 2D seismic and technical studies. We expect to produce large volumes of heavy crude oil. However, this depends on the results of our appraisal and exploration work, which will be available by the end of 2013. As stated by the government of Ecuador, the Pungarayacu field could be key to further development of the oil industry in the country; the field has large reserves of some 6 billion barrels of heavy crude oil. We believe that Ecuador is gradually moving from light oil toward heavy oil production. In this regard, our current drilling of the IP-17 well (pre-cretaceous) is key, as it could open new opportunities in the pre-cretaceous reservoirs for the industry, creating new exploration and production areas.</p><h4>Who owns the Block 20 concession in the Pungarayacu field?</h4><p>EP Petroecuador owns Block 20 and Ivanhoe Energy Ecuador is responsible for specific services, operation, production, and investments in the block. Our company, using its patented Heavy To Light (HTL[TM]) technology, has the possibility to transform heavy crude into a lighter product, and is also leading exploration work in potential wells. Once we begin production activities, we will transfer crude oil to EP Petroecuador as per our contract, and it will distribute it.</p><div class="quote">“I am confident that we will see high levels of investment in the region."</div><h4>Since Ivanhoe owns the HTL technology patent, could you tell us more about this process?</h4><p>HTL is an upgrading process that can be located on-site at heavy oil fields and is completely integrated with upstream operations. The HTL process converts heavy oil to lighter oil, a more valuable product that can be transported by pipeline without the need for light blend oils. In addition, coke and gas—products gained from the upgrading process—are converted in situ to steam or power, which becomes available to the operator developing the field. HTL is based on the time-tested concept of thermal cracking and carbon rejection, and incorporates ultra-short processing times compared with those of conventional technology. Moreover, the process does not require catalysts, hydrogen, or significant pressure. The net result is relatively small-scale, low-cost facilities that can be located where the energy is, maximizing the benefits of heat integration. We are able to transform heavy oil into light oil, as well as gas and electricity by-products, thanks to this technology. Ivanhoe Energy's HTL process represents the application of a commercial technology to a new feedstock, and incorporates the benefits of this unique development process to any heavy and/or ultra heavy oil field.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for Ivanhoe in Ecuador?</h4><p>Up until now, IEE has focused on the first stage of the Pungarayacu oil field project, and we are aiming to speed up exploration and engineering studies to carry the project through to the next stage. We have focused on this strategy since we were established in Ecuador, and we expect to begin applying our unique technology once we have completed exploration activities in the southern part of Block 20 and have received approval for our development plan by the Ecuadorean authorities. Outside of our block, taking into account the Ecuadorean government's plan to seek the development of oil blocks in the southern part of country, if companies discover heavy oil there, our technology will be key, considering the difficulty in moving any potential production of heavy oils to export points. Thus, looking forward, we believe potential operating companies will seek an in situ technology that transforms heavy oil into a lighter product, and Ivanhoe will be there for those companies.</p><h4>Is Ivanhoe Energy currently holding talks with potential companies that could be operating in the southern fields?</h4><p>Thus far, we have not consulted with other companies about this possibility. However, we are in the process of establishing partnerships and associations with enterprises in other countries. I believe that in the near future, Ivanhoe Energy will take similar steps in Ecuador.</p><h4>What are your expectations in terms of gas and electricity production?</h4><p>The HTL process makes it possible to generate electricity as a by-product, which is very important for optimizing operational costs, and as such gas and electricity production is internally used for production. It remains difficult to transfer such energy to the national grid for other types of consumption.</p><h4>What role does Ecuador play in Ivanhoe Energy's global strategy?</h4><p>Ecuador is a key market for the company's global business strategy; both Ecuador and the Latin American region are potential markets for the development of the company at an international level. I am confident that we will see high levels of investment in the region, starting with the application of HTL technological processes in many Latin American oil fields.</p><h4>What level of investment can we expect from Ivanhoe Energy in Ecuador over the next few years?</h4><p>Ivanhoe Energy will complete the first stage of investment in Block 20. We are planning to invest in a heavy oil pilot well, where we will apply a technology that is new to Ecuador and optimizes heavy oil production. This budget line is also part of our estimated investment. Once we receive results from the exploration work, we will develop a 30-year investment plan and a strategy for Block 20. We aim to start producing as soon as possible in the wells we will operate.</p><h4>What are the characteristics of Ivanhoe Energy's potential partners?</h4><p>Potential partners have to contribute capital and know-how, especially regarding subsoil activities. Because we are a strong company in the technological field, we are not looking for a partner similar to Ivanhoe Energy.</p><h4>What are the main challenges Ivanhoe Energy faces in Ecuador?</h4><p>There are three major challenges. Moving heavy oils without affecting the local population represents the main technical challenge, because Ecuador needs to strengthen its logistical infrastructure. Another is applying our technology to convert heavy oil into a lighter product that reduces the impact on the environment, lowers costs, and generates as much energy as possible. We also face a social challenge in terms of working with the existing communities near the wells we are planning to operate in the near future. In this regard, we plan to implement an educational project for technological transfer with the government of Ecuador and the local communities, especially in the city of Tena, where there is no oil industry culture yet.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-recovery-factor]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current opportunities for companies such as Schlumberger in Ecuador?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry in Ecuador is facing many challenges, especially in terms of the characterization and development of mature fields. We believe that the innovative technology, services, and expertise that Schlumberger can provide makes a difference and is needed.</p><h4>What is the relevance of Ecuador for Schlumberger in Latin America?</h4><p>Currently, Schlumberger is operating in more than 12 countries in Latin America. Working in these countries creates synergies and similarities in the ways we work, especially in relation to the reservoir types and operational characteristics. These synergies and similarities foster an exchange of technical knowledge and expertise from different regions. The experience Schlumberger has in Colombia and Mexico on the development of mature fields is being transferred to Ecuador. We have developed fantastic expertise in deepwater operations in Brazil, which can be introduced to new markets in the region and globally. From another aspect, Ecuador's reservoirs present a wide variety of opportunities for technology and technical development, aimed to maximize production in mature fields, maintain efficiency, and increase the recovery factor. Having said that, this is definitely a market that cannot be ignored; it has a great potential for continued development and growth.</p><div class="quote">“Schlumberger has a committed investment of $1.2 billion."</div><h4>What are Schlumberger's future investments in mature fields and key aspects of the contract signed with the government?</h4><p>Schlumberger is the world's leading oilfield service company, and provides technology and services to support key or fundamental processes in the exploration and production industry. Wherever Schlumberger operates, we behave as a leader in oilfield services. Our long presence and commitment to Ecuador's oil industry continues as we invest in technological applications, field studies, and the development of processes, and these are all relevant to our ambitions in the country. In other words, Schlumberger is investing in technology and will continue to support the country over the years to come. Our new contract is a fundamental element of this goal.</p><h4>What amount of investment has Schlumberger made in the mature fields?</h4><p>Schlumberger has a committed investment of $1.2 billion. This amount may increase depending on the results of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects that we will pilot first. We will evaluate the results before deciding on the final investment amount.</p><h4>How is Schlumberger taking a role in increasing the visibility of Ecuador's oil and gas industry in the petro-technical community worldwide?</h4><p>We raise awareness by bringing in experts, organizing workshops, hosting conferences, and increasing the amount of reports created in the country that will be presented in different conferences or workshops worldwide.</p><h4>How do you attract professionals to Ecuador?</h4><p>Schlumberger has always valued its human resources. We believe in training and promoting from within. We recruit locally, and offer all the necessary training to develop our employees to their full capabilities. We will continue this strategy in Ecuador, and increase the amount of local talent at our company. We have specific programs and centers where we train people in different areas of the industry and in the various services we provide. We also carry out training courses abroad, where people from different areas and backgrounds educate our employees. Attracting the right professionals is a challenge, and Schlumberger aims to keep recruiting the best talent from local universities.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the company in Ecuador?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry is entering a new era, in which there are more difficulties and increased complexity in finding and developing new reserves, as well as maintaining production at existing sites. Extra effort is required to overcome these challenges. We believe that the company that can best help customers, diminish risk, and carry out projects with maximum efficiency is the one that will ultimately succeed. This will be the focus of oilfield service companies in the future. At Schlumberger, we can provide a complete offering based on knowledge and technical innovation, and we have six R&amp;D and 65 Technology and Product Centers across the globe. The company continues to work on innovation and technology, providing value to the market. By applying our scientific data and technical ability to our regional operations, we believe that we can offset many of the challenges that customers face.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose Kazakhstan as a place to start business?</h4><p>In my high school graduation yearbook from 1982, I wrote that my greatest dream was to study medicine and work with our brothers in Central Asia. Although I decided not to practice medicine upon graduating from Çukurova University in 1989, I did decide to do business with the newly independent Central Asian republics and focused on Kazakhstan. My childhood friend Ismail Koyuncu is of Uzbekistani origin, and we worked together to establish our first company in 1992. When we started the enterprise, we did not have huge amounts of capital, but we had passion and faith in our goal. Since then, we have worked hard to not disappoint the people who trusted us. We delivered all the products our clients ordered on time, even if it caused us losses. The combination of our trustworthiness, sincerity, and organizational excellence led to our current success. We moved our head office from Istanbul to Almaty in 1997. From our Almaty center we operate in Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Mongolia. We are also planning to expand into Afghanistan. Today, we are leaders in every business segment we operate in, including distribution, construction, and industry, and we aim to maintain our position as one of the top three companies in each sector.</p><h4>What were your initial areas of focus?</h4><p>Having a vision is synonymous with the ability to take tomorrow's picture today, and establish a strategy accordingly. We did not reinvent the system—we just discovered our niche and excelled in it. Our departure point was to market Turkish exports in Kazakhstan. When we first arrived here, we saw that the production line from the Soviet era was broken, and there were many consumer needs in every sector. Until 1994, we imported a wide array of goods from Turkey, anything from soap to blankets. In an environment where a plethora of Turkish firms have tried to conduct a similar import business, we took the radical decision of not importing from Turkey and began to distribute goods from other countries. As our distribution network expanded, we negotiated with new partners such as Unilever and Nestlé, and we have been working together with them for more than 15 years.</p><div class="quote">“Having a vision is synonymous with the ability to take tomorrow's picture today, and establish a strategy accordingly."</div><h4>What role does Turkuaz Group play in the development of industry and energy infrastructure in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Soaring chimneys and endless fields have always inspired me. With this excitement, we have launched our operations in industry. Currently, there are four factories, two of which belong to Turkuaz Group: a brick factory and a tea factory. We also have two partnerships. Through our partnership with Henkel, we produce construction materials. With our Saudi Arabian partner, Savola Group, we operate a sunflower oil factory. Annually, we produce 80 million liters of sunflower oil, which is the largest capacity in Central Asia. Our brands are market leaders. Although we established this factory independently, we later partnered with the Savola Group, demonstrating our willingness to form foreign partnerships. Although we are a foreign company in Kazakhstan, we have attained an excellent level of localization. This achievement helps us successfully integrate our corporate culture and professionalism with local requirements. Therefore, it is beneficial for foreign investors to partner with Turkuaz in Kazakhstan. The fact that global leaders such as Henkel and Savola partnered with Turkuaz proves our competence as a local partner of foreign origin. Looking ahead, we are interested in the energy sector. Energy is a subject we would like to explore, and we are particularly interested in power generation. Provided that Kazakhstan has increasing power needs and that the government continues to focus on privatization, the energy sector is an area we would like to pursue.</p><h4>What advice do you offer to foreign investors interested in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>President Nazarbayev is a formidable leader for Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the entire Turkic population. Against the backdrop of every cultural, economic, and political difference among the Central Asian nations, I strongly believe that Kazakhstan is the leader in the region. Kazakhstan is also the most attractive country for foreign investors who seek stability and growth along with access to the CIS markets of more than 200 million people, including Russia. However, it is not possible to replicate the gold rush of the early 1990s in Kazakhstan. My advice to investors that come to Kazakhstan is to do the business they excel at instead of starting new adventures. Kazakhstan presents many opportunities to investors, not only in the extractive industries, but in other fields as well. Investors should keep in mind that they might find themselves in a position to manufacture in the country, as the majority of the country's consumer goods are imported. In general, we strongly welcome investors to Kazakhstan.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the key role of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and how has that role has evolved since it was originally incepted?</h4><p>The DIFC was created to bridge the gap between the financial centers of London and Hong Kong. This jurisdictional gap is a significant region of about 42 countries spanning a wide geographical scope. However, it also has a lot of potential in terms of wealth in individuals, institutions, and investment companies that are able to invest in new infrastructure and are excited about these opportunities. These factors were in place, but what was missing was a sound international financial center to centralize the wealth and facilitate business, and so the DIFC was established in 2004. In order to be at the level of power of other international centers, we had to get several aspects of the model right; specifically infrastructure, because we cannot simply be a free trade zone. The entire eco-system has to match other leading centers, and that predominantly lies in the soft infrastructure such as laws, regulations, and judicial authority. We have seen growth because of the institutions we covered, in terms of numbers of people working and also companies. Private developments in the free zone are also popping up. We have the majority of major businesses at the center; 21 of the largest 30 banks are with us, eight of the 20 largest asset managers, six out of the top 10 insurers, and six out of the top 10 law firms. We have been able to attract those major players and create jobs and transfer knowledge into the community.</p><h4>How important was establishing the right regulatory climate within the DIFC?</h4><p>An extensive amount of time has been spent developing the legal infrastructure, including laws and regulations through discussions with the federal cabinet of the UAE in terms of what type of independence the center could have. The UAE government entrusted the center and provided it with independence by means of applying a common law jurisdiction. This is very appealing for the international financial community because it feels at home with a familiar system, while being closer to its target audience. There are three bodies that govern the DIFC, yet perform independently from each other. On one side there is the DIFC Authority looking after the master plan and strategy of the center. We develop the infrastructure and we govern all non-financial services carried out from the DIFC and provide promotion for the center. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) is the financial services regulator, and it licenses financial institutions to carry out business, supervises these financial institutions, and enforces regulations. The third body is the Judicial Authority, DIFC courts, which has independent jurisdiction over civil and commercial matters arising from the center. We also have an Arbitration Centre, DIFC-LCIA, which offers dispute and resolution services and alternatives to the courts.</p><div class="quote">“The DIFC was created to bridge the gap between the financial centers of London and Hong Kong."</div><h4>What was the strategy behind creating a micro-city?</h4><p>It is 110 acres and there is a concept of a state within a state. First, we talked about how sound and advanced the legal structure had to be. We have ensured that a world-class infrastructure was in place, as well as business-friendly laws. Another major factor, which is common in all major financial centers, is lifestyle. That is quite important for us, and we focused on creating the environment in an all-inclusive manner. The institutions that are operating here and their employees do not feel that this is predominantly just a space or an office park; we added the lifestyle component and it became a jurisdiction of choice. People can live here, enjoying their time after work at the cafes, restaurants, and art galleries. You have to create an environment where people are happy working and it is often the case that large employers often find it difficult to recruit people from abroad because of where they are investing. These places have to offer good choices in terms of schools, healthcare systems, and quality of life. I think that is where Dubai excelled, as everything is integrated; everything is very advanced here and moving at the same pace. When we talk about growth and emerging markets, this is where the focus lies right now.</p><h4>How important is Dubai as a hub for other emerging markets and what role is the development of the new Silk Route playing?</h4><p>I think it is quite central; the role Dubai plays between growth markets is a crucial one. Dubai offers unparalleled value to institutions that want to tap into emerging market areas. If you look at the locale of what is between London and Hong Kong, there is Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, and the trend has been there for the past two years. Even international banks have seen their future is here and are actually reinforcing their presence here whilst they have been more conservative and cutting down elsewhere. These banks understand the future is here, whether it is in infrastructure, financing, trade financing, project financing activities, or other projects in predominantly growth markets. The Chinese banks are following all of their clients into Africa, and banks are talking to us and choosing DIFC as their base because it is the more logical choice for them; South Asia is the same. Connecting Brazil to China via Dubai makes more sense because of the convenience of direct airlines and flights.</p><h4>How important is NASDAQ Dubai in terms of the development of local capital markets?</h4><p>Any financial center has to have active, liquid capital markets in place, and I think in that manner NASDAQ Dubai plays in an important part in Dubai's strategy as an international center. But to complement the center, NASDAQ Dubai is also an international exchange because of the international listing requirements, the obligations that have been put in place, and the fact that it is also regulated by the DFSA. International investors appreciate the choice for the international exchange as opposed to local exchanges.</p><h4>How have you re-aligned your strategy since the financial crisis?</h4><p>It is ironic because the crisis that happened in 2009 was about the time that we had our fifth anniversary, and we had already undertaken a plan to revise the business strategy of the center. We saw that we had met the initial goal of creating a critical mass, creating awareness, and developing the DIFC's recognition at an international level. The next step was for us to become a more mature financial center by means of scale, because if we were to compete with the likes of London, New York, or Hong Kong, they obviously have an advantage because of their age. When we look at the scale of activity, we see that more assets are being booked and more business is happening. In that respect, we need to focus on building scale, and what that means is that we not only need to focus on acquiring new clients, but we also need to focus on current existing players to expand by means of added business securities and coverage. We have seen a significant amount of organic growth since 2009—not only new companies but existing players also expanding their footprint, adding more functions and people. Now, from a key performance indicator perspective, while that does add to the number of new companies, it also adds in terms of economic value and GDP contribution. That is also now central to our strategy. For example, we have institutions that have made the DIFC their global home; Standard Chartered started small and now has over 700 people with its own building and has moved its CEOs for all regions expect East Asia to Dubai. Bloomberg also established its 10th global office in the DIFC.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The international crisis has turned the spotlight on emerging economies. In light of this, what advantages can Mexico offer?</h4><p>As a result of the country's commitment to economic stability and free trade, Mexico has become a strategic platform to reach key markets around the globe. Mexico offers many competitive advantages such as its macroeconomic stability, economic growth, a business-friendly environment, its strategic location, capacity for advanced manufacturing, an open economy, and the availability of skilled human capital. The country's network of trade agreements spans 44 countries, which makes us a platform that reaches far beyond North America, and gives products made in Mexico preferential access to over 1 billion consumers and two-thirds of the world's GDP. Furthermore, the commitment to free trade has made Mexican industries extremely competitive, because goods made in Mexico compete with the best available worldwide. However, market access isn't enough. In fact, according to the Inter-American Development Bank, freight cost as a percentage of exports is 3% lower in Mexico than in Asia. Secondly, Mexico is in the midst of a demographic bonus, full of young and skilled human capital. Each year, over 115,000 engineers complete their higher education at one of Mexico's 2,964 universities and technical institutions. In fact, Mexico has more engineering students than Brazil, the UK, or Germany. This human capital is a cornerstone for Mexico's future economic development. According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity, recently published by Harvard and MIT, Mexico ranks 20th worldwide, well above all of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries. The study shows Mexico's capacity to produce and export numerous sophisticated goods to multiple countries. It further indicates that Mexico is able to harness and transfer a vast amount of productive knowledge, which is a strong indicator of future economic development. This fact is reinforced by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD's) Index of Technological Sophistication, in which Mexican goods rank higher than those produced in India or Brazil. Therefore, we can state that Mexico offers fertile business opportunities based on innovation and R&amp;D. For these and many other reasons, it is not surprising that analysts predict that Mexico will rank between the fifth and eighth largest economy in the world by 2050.</p><h4>How does ProMéxico contribute to the country's success in trade and attracting foreign direct investment?</h4><p>The flow of FDI and international trade are key components of Mexico's economy. To this end, ProMéxico promotes the exports of companies established in Mexico, coordinates actions to attract FDI, and assists Mexican companies to become international firms. ProMéxico has 33 offices in 22 countries, which allows it to reach more than 70% of the world's GDP, in addition to 29 offices in 26 states, and its headquarters in Mexico City. Through our offices, we promote the country and its companies around the globe, advise companies throughout their export or investment process, facilitate doing business either as a foreigner in Mexico or a Mexican abroad, and connect companies as well as private and public institutions to create value-added networks. ProMéxico combines its services into several usage models to be more efficient. Three examples are the Demand Generation, Aftercare, and Alliance with Multinational Companies programs. Our Demand Generation Program connects Mexican suppliers with potential buyers abroad. To do so, our offices detect and contact large potential customers, and evaluate their needs. Based on this confirmed interest, ProMéxico searches for qualified suppliers, facilitates introductions, and works with the companies to help them address the needs of the foreign client. Once a foreign investor initiates operations in Mexico, the Aftercare Program provides ongoing assistance to facilitate optimal performance, thereby creating attractive conditions to re-invest and expand their operations. With the Alliance with Multinational Companies Program, we work with multinationals established in Mexico to identify supply chain needs. Then we collaborate with the company to both introduce them to domestic suppliers and work with their foreign suppliers to help locate operations to Mexico. As a result, the company reduces supply chain gaps and improves its response to market changes. Meanwhile, we increase the local content in final products, and eventually fuel more manufactured exports. In summary, ProMéxico offers both investors and exporters customized support through a wide range of solutions and services to “bring more of Mexico to the world and more of the world to Mexico."</p><div class="quote">“Mexico has become a global export powerhouse, renowned for high-quality products."</div><h4>You mentioned Mexico's commitment to free trade. What do you see in the country's future in this respect?</h4><p>Since joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986, Mexico has been a strong promoter of free trade. As a result, Mexico has become a global export powerhouse, renowned for high-quality products, and an important center for advanced manufacturing. Not only have Mexican exports grown by more than 16 times since 1985, but they have increased in sophistication. Today, Mexico is a leading manufacturing exporter with close to 80% of our exports being manufactured goods, compared to only 23% in 1985. In 2011, Mexican exports reached a record high of nearly $350 billion, which is 17% more than in 2010 and 110% when compared to 2000. It is also worth noting that Mexico is the largest exporter in Latin America. In fact, last year we exported the equivalent of Brazil and Argentina combined. Notwithstanding its important network of free trade agreements, Mexico continues to diversify its export markets. We are looking toward Latin America, Africa, Asia, and some European countries. For example, Mexico is promoting joint actions to create synergies in commercial and economic matters within the framework of the Trans-Pacific Alliance as a means to strengthen relations with Asian economies. Closer to home, Mexico promotes further integration with Peru, Chile, and Colombia in order to fortify this region's competitiveness. An alliance between the four countries represents an important opportunity. To give you an idea, these four economies will trade $443 billion, which is more than 1.5 times the size of the Common Southern Market (MERCOSUR), currently at $281 billion. Nonetheless, the future isn't limited to exports. Mexico's domestic industry offers great potential, and internationalization is a natural step after exporting. For this reason, ProMéxico is implementing an aggressive strategy to facilitate this process. In addition to working with the large Mexican conglomerates to further expand their global presence, ProMéxico is increasingly assisting innovative SMEs to venture abroad.</p><h4>What type of FDI is Mexico attracting and how does this contribute to the country's growth?</h4><p>The Atlas of Economic Complexity discusses how a country's ability to amass and transfer know-how allows a society to recombine it in order to create a larger variety of smarter and better products. The evolution of our automotive industry showcases how Mexico has evolved toward increasingly advanced manufacturing, which creates opportunities for other industries. The automotive industry required a supply chain of specialized and certifiable high-precision technologies; which in turn enabled other industries with similar requirements, namely the aerospace, electric/electronic, and medical device industries. We consider high value-added sectors as strategic, because of the domino effect on the country's productive capacity, which in turn translates into more and better-paid jobs, hence creating a virtuous growth cycle. The eight strategic sectors we have identified are: automotive, aerospace, electric-electronic, medical devices, creative industries, IT, agribusiness, and renewable energy. Mexico is the fifth largest automotive exporter. Meanwhile, our aerospace exports totaled $4.3 billion in 2011. Our aerospace industry was almost non-existent a decade ago, but has quadrupled since 2005, to currently number 250 companies. The industry also experienced a 19% compounded annual growth for the past seven years. In fact, a plane with Mexican technology takes off every two seconds.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key elements that have led consistent profit year after year?</h4><p>The 2011-2012 financial year was a challenging one for Emirates. To have achieved a profit in spite of record fuel prices and unprecedented economic pressure is testament to our tenacity. Our success is governed by our long-term strategy of reinvesting our profits directly into our product. In the last financial year alone we invested heavily in new products that will help us maintain our position as one of the world's fastest growing and most innovative airline. In addition to new on-board and on-the-ground innovations, Emirates received 22 state-of-the-art aircraft last financial year; a wide-bodied mix of A380s and Boeing 777s. Each of these new aircraft is already playing a key role in our future growth and expansion plans.</p><h4>How interconnected is the Emirates success story with Dubai's own as an aviation hub?</h4><p>The incredible success of Emirates and Dubai are intricately linked. Dubai is a dynamic and vibrant city and it has played a key role in shaping Emirates into the carrier that it is today. In the last 27 years, Emirates and Dubai have grown alongside each other. With its vast network of global destinations, all connected via its Dubai hub, Emirates has helped to showcase the unique vitality of Dubai. Dubai is centrally located between East and West, with access to two-thirds of the world's population via a maximum eight-hour flight. This geographical positioning has served to provide us with a unique advantage and one that we have certainly capitalized on.</p><div class="quote">“Our passengers' expectations only continue to get higher and it is imperative that we continue to move forward with them."</div><h4>The ever-increasing development of local airlines, as well as global giants, has created a highly competitive environment, and Emirates attracts its fair share of envious glances. How has the company's strategy adjusted to deal with increased competition?</h4><p>At Emirates we believe that competition is good for the industry and importantly, it is even better for the customer. Competition between airlines serves to stimulate demand. It keeps airlines on their toes and ensures that they work harder to win a customer's patronage. Emirates operates from Dubai International Airport, which operates under an unconditional open-skies policy. This open skies policy has ensured that we remain competitive. Emirates does not benefit from any form of government subsidy, and this has proved to be a key measure of our success. Standing on our own we continue to thrive, remaining profitable through challenging times and importantly remaining the carrier of choice for the 34 million passengers that travelled with us in the 2011-12 financial year. Our strategy for success remains the same, no matter how many competitors there are. We continue to stay true to our proven business model, growing organically with new, modern aircraft and carefully selected destinations that we know will provide a strong return.</p><h4>Rising fuel prices, regional political unrest, and global economic woes are creating challenging times for the airline industry. In what ways are these factors impacting the airline?</h4><p>Business conditions this last year have been challenging for the entire aviation industry. Emirates is fortunate enough to possess an excellent product line that has helped shield it from the brunt of last year's difficult operating climate. Our young fleet of aircraft, a growing network, world-class service, and competitive prices have helped to ensure that we continue to attract new customers as well as retain those who already fly with us.</p><h4>Emirates lifted the fuel surcharge from the price of tickets last year. What was the driver behind this, and how long do you see it remaining in place?</h4><p>Unfortunately, like all airlines, we are reliant on fuel to operate our business. With no sign of fuel prices decreasing, a fuel surcharge was implemented on tickets in February to help mitigate these increased costs.</p><h4>The first flight landed into Al Maktoum International Airport in 2010. How will the development of the second Dubai airport change the dynamics of the city?</h4><p>Dubai World Central—Al Maktoum International Airport—is being developed in Jebel Ali to cater to the future aviation and logistics needs of Dubai. There is no doubt that the new airport will play an increasingly important role in the Emirate's long-term aviation goals. Emirates aims to move to the new Dubai World Central airport between 2022 and 2030, and with plans to add hundreds of aircraft and destinations over the coming decades, we are the main driver behind its construction and will be the principal customer.</p><h4>You are currently establishing the world's largest fleet of A380s. How large will the fleet be, and what is the plan for its deployment?</h4><p>Emirates is currently the world's largest operator of the A380. We have 21 in our fleet today and a further 69 on order; more than any other carrier. The A380 is an excellent aircraft, and feedback from our customers continues to be incredibly positive. Premium and overall seat factor for our A380 aircraft sat even higher than the rest of our fleet in the 2011-12 financial year, highlighting a continued demand in the product from passengers. Every single one of the A380s we have ordered is carefully planned for Emirates' present and future requirements. Our A380s are specifically deployed on high-density routes where extra capacity is needed. The A380 can carry more passengers further, thus maximizing the use of slot-constrained infrastructure and reducing the number of required take offs and landings. In the coming months we have several new A380 destinations that will be launched, including Tokyo, Amsterdam, and Melbourne. In total we now fly to 17 A380 destinations across our network. The A380 sets a new standard for aviation and the environment and it plays a key role in our mission to operate an internationally renowned airline while maintaining a high degree of social responsibility. Based on fuel and emission efficiency, Emirates' A380s are some of the most environmentally advanced aircraft in the sky. The A380 is quieter than any other aircraft, both inside and outside the cabin.</p><h4>What is the airline's ongoing strategy in the quest to establish a robust global presence?</h4><p>Our passengers' expectations only continue to get higher and it is imperative that we continue to move forward with them. Growth is an important part of any company's survival and for Emirates our growth is directly attributable to the number of passengers that choose to travel with us. It is for this reason that we invest billions of dollars each year in expanding our service offering by way of new destinations, new aircraft and new, innovative customer focused products. In the last five years Emirates' route network has grown by nearly 40% and in the 2012-13 financial year we have already announced new services to four destinations, including Ho Chi Minh City, Lisbon, Barcelona, and Washington D.C.</p><h4>What were the main lessons learned during the global liquidity crisis, and to what extent would you say the economy is starting to recover?</h4><p>Since the global financial crisis, there has been a marked shift in business travel movements from East to West. We have witnessed incredible growth throughout Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent and we continue to capitalize on this with new links, additional frequencies, and upgraded capacity. The global economic situation has improved, but it is not uniform across all markets and is again showing volatility in the eurozone. Our development plans for all areas of our business remain on track and we are confident that our robust business model will continue to reap rewards.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main function of the Central Bank of Ecuador (CBE)?</h4><p>When Ecuador became dollarized, the central bank assumed the role of a control agent that monitors the flow of the currency in the economy. The CBE cannot issue money, but instead verifies the monetary stability of the country. It analyzes the monetary supply that is circulating in the economy, implements mechanisms that make monetary supply more efficient, and protects the economy from external shocks.</p><h4>How does the CBE ensure that monetary supply control is efficient?</h4><p>The CBE affects the velocity of circulation. We are working toward the modernization of national payment systems in order to make all transactional mechanisms similar to the modern methods used in developed countries. In many countries, you can enter any business point and make payments using magnetic technology, such as a debit card or mobile payment systems. We haven't achieved this level of efficiency in Ecuador, and the objective of the CBE in 2012 is to accelerate the penetration of electronic transactions so that people from both urban and rural areas have access to electronic and mobile payment methods. The CBE has a strong capacity to manage the economy by controlling the flow of money.</p><div class="quote">“Our growth depends on the depth of the crisis in Europe, which can easily affect the global economy."</div><h4>What does the freely available monetary fund consist of and how does the country utilize it?</h4><p>When we used a local currency, the freely available monetary fund was a protection mechanism against crises. In a dollarized economy, the freely available monetary fund cannot be a control mechanism to cover external shocks. During the most recent crisis, complex accounting management took place. When the economy shifted to dollarization, four balance sheets were created for the CBE, and included within these documents is the concept of the freely available monetary fund. According to the law of the CBE, the IMF is still mentioned, in addition to national funds. In practice, we have to manage a general reserve and understand how much money supply we can depend on to respond to external shocks.</p><h4>What is the amount available to cover a possible crisis?</h4><p>We manage the currency flow in the economy adequately. Adding up every fund, we have available amounts of over 30% of GDP, which corresponds to all the currency that is circulating in the economy. This currency would be readily available in a time of crisis. In terms of the freely available fund, it contains more than $3.5 billion on average; in circulating currency there is $26.5 billion. These resources are more than enough to control an external shock. However, no amount would cover a calamity as severe as the crisis in Greece. In 2008, we had enough maneuvering capacity to use roughly $1.2 billion to control the economy, and currently we are enjoying favorable rates of growth. During the crisis, we experienced a 1% growth rate, followed by 3%, 4%, and 8% in 2009-2011, respectively. We have learned that managing a crisis is not related to the size of the fund, but rather to the efficient use of resources.</p><h4>What is your forecast for 2012 in terms of trade balance?</h4><p>Our predictions for 2012 are positive, and we firmly believe we will maintain excellent growth rates around 5%. Our growth depends on the depth of the crisis in Europe, which can easily affect the global economy. Regardless, we believe that 2012 will be a year of growth. In terms of our trade balance, we believe that a certain deficit level will continue, as historically the economy has registered trade balance deficits. The gap of the trade balance is covered by investments in high-yield projects and the increase of exports. There has been important growth in exports from the country and a considerable reduction in imports, and for the first time sectors such as textiles and metallurgy are growing at rates higher than 5% or 6%. Sectors that were historically importing products are now manufacturing locally and conserving the currency outflow. The concern regarding the trade balance is not the deficit itself, but the quality of the deficit that is determined by the types of products we are importing.</p><h4>What expectations do you have for the introduction of mobile banking in Ecuador?</h4><p>Mobile banking is a payment method that facilitates financial inclusion. We, however, are also creating a much more powerful scheme that will allow people to carry out financial transactions using various methods of interaction. Through this integrated system, people will be able to utilize banking or non-banking agents to make withdrawals, make payments, receive and send remittances, and check balances. The mobile wallet is only an additional payment method. What we are creating is a very powerful transactional system that will include cooperatives and specialized banks. We hope that non-banking agents and other non-financial institutions will participate so we can provide financial transaction solutions to people in urban and rural areas.</p><h4>For what reasons is there an absence of large foreign banks in Ecuador?</h4><p>The big international banking groups came to Latin America over 15 or 20 year ago. The Spanish banking groups have the widest presence, as they bought banks from Mexico to Chile. However, these were investments made in the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s. Unfortunately in Ecuador, the position of the interested powers that controlled the banking industry prevented the entrance of the international banks in a major way. Ecuador was thus left behind as these groups began to make inroads into Latin America. In terms of the future, I don't believe they will make an entrance in the short term, because these banking groups are concentrating on surviving the crisis and they are not investing in any new regions around the world. Our expectation is that other kinds of groups will come from neighboring countries, such as specialized banks. However, this also won't happen in the short term because of the international juncture. We do believe that there are opportunities, thanks to the anti-monopoly law passed last year, as it limits banking groups or their shareholders from making investments in the real or media sectors. This has opened up many opportunities, as many financial groups with interests in the real sector have decided to sell off their participation in the financial sector. This will be an opportunity for groups specialized in the financial sector to buy these participants. The same happens with insurance companies because the law also states that banks can't own insurance companies. Therefore, the shareholders are selling their assets in the insurance sector, and this is opening up a myriad of opportunities for groups that are specialized in this sector. These facts will generate lots of opportunities, and it is also the right time as the regulatory framework is incentivizing development in this area.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan's current agriculture policy aims at developing more competitive agribusinesses. How do you describe the agenda of the government for the coming decade?</h4><p>The Ministry of Agriculture has three main objectives: improving productivity, ensuring food security, and increasing the export potential of the agriculture sector. These problems can be solved by encouraging agro-industrial diversification, providing increased production of agricultural raw materials and food, boosting the technical and technological modernization of industry, and developing new approaches to state support for agriculture. In this regard, the Ministry has developed a program for the development of agriculture in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2010-2014. In accordance with the program, policies are designed to achieve full self-sufficiency in the country for all types of agricultural products. This will be achieved through increased crop production, structural and technological diversification, the application of modern manufacturing technology, and the wider use of chemicals. The government is also working to develop new and currently unused irrigated land.</p><h4>What measures have been taken by the government to improve the efficiency of livestock production and the mechanization of agriculture in the country?</h4><p>The strategy provides for an increase in livestock production through the transfer of industrial know-how, the development of breeding stock, and importation of breeding cattle. Particular attention has been paid to the development of beef cattle in the future. The strategy in the processing of agricultural products is aimed at the technical and technological re-equipment of production and a transition to international quality standards, which will expand the range of food products and enable us to compete with our major trading partners in the Customs Union. In order to stimulate the economic development of the industry and enhance its investment attractiveness, agricultural subsidies will continue, making the maximum use of stimulus features. To increase the production volume and quality of beef, a project called the “Development of Export Potential of Beef" was approved by the Head of State and is now being implemented. In the next five years, up to 60 feedlots with a total capacity of 150,000 feeding units will be built; 72,000 head of pedigree cattle will be delivered from abroad and 54 breeding farms will be created. Furthermore, a project to train 2,500 farmers with 300,000 head of breeding stock will be implemented. The implementation of these activities forms the budget that is available to agricultural producers in the form of credits.</p><div class="quote">“Kazakhstan's agricultural sector is a steadily growing segment of the economy."</div><h4>How can Kazakhstan improve its status as a major international exporter of grain and livestock in the global market?</h4><p>At present, Kazakhstan's agricultural sector is a steadily growing segment of the economy, which provides not only the country's food security but also the export of agricultural products. It is very important to use the potential of agricultural resources such as large reserves of undeveloped land, water, and other natural wealth. Kazakhstan boasts more than 2.7 million square kilometers, and ranks ninth in the world in terms of land area. As is well known in the current economic conditions, a key factor in ensuring a competitive edge is use of high technology and the scale of production with efficient organization. This can only be achieved through the expansion of our markets. The Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus is an important step toward the integration of these countries. The customs border between our countries has been completely eliminated, and the transportation of goods shall be free. This has formed a single market for goods with a population under 170 million and total GDP of about $1.8 trillion. According to the Kazakhstan Statistics Agency, in 2010 the volume of production in the food industry amounted to KZT673.3 billion, an increase of 12.9% over 2009. In terms of the production capacity of agricultural commodities, the volume and geography of exports will also expand. As for the prospects of food exports, we would like to note that global population growth exerts enormous pressure on agriculture as the production of agricultural products and processed products is not keeping up with the growing demand. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicts that food consumption in the world will grow by 70% by 2050. Experts and analysts in the field of food security point out that today the world is already facing problems of food shortages and high prices, leading to famine, political unrest, and revolution. In particular, in 2011 the UN food index reached a maximum altitude. As a result, food is a hidden force that also shapes world politics. In this situation, given the presence of more than 93 million hectares of agricultural land in Kazakhstan and almost all types of climatic conditions and soil zones, Kazakhstan has great opportunities for increasing exports of agricultural products.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to increase the volume and quality of small producers?</h4><p>The program for the development of agriculture in Kazakhstan from 2010 to 2014 includes measures of state support aimed at improving the effectiveness of small, medium, and large farms, as well as family farms and the development of agriculture in general. The focus areas are the development of seed production, the reduction of the cost of fuel and lubricants (and other inventory items required for harvesting), the delivery of irrigated water to agricultural producers, the provision of bookmarks and cultivation of perennial fruit berries and grapes, the examination of the quality of Kazakhstani cotton, and the increased productivity and quality of crops. The animal husbandry segment has seen a steady increase in the number of cattle, poultry, and livestock production. In order to stimulate the development of domestic agricultural producers, including families and individual farmers, state support is aimed at decreasing the cost of breeding products by 50%, the cost of feed and concentrated feed by 45%, as well as partially refunding the cost of producing milk, wool, fine-wool sheep, mutton, horseflesh, kymis, and shubat. The support mechanism also includes non-financial support measures such as conducting training seminars for agricultural producers and granting access to free information on agricultural subjects. Additionally, the Ministry of Agriculture is lending to farmers. Through concessional lending, the rural population is able to purchase equipment and livestock. The cost of credit, issued by subsidiaries of the Ministry's Holding Company, is substantially below the cost of loans granted by the banking system and also has favorable payback schemes.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012 and beyond?</h4><p>The improvement and strengthening of state support will continue to increase, as well as investments in agriculture and the food industry. The agriculture master plan contains information on the necessary types of products and their volumes in line with the needs of the population and external markets, which allows investors to set clear targets and function as indicators for entrepreneurs as financial institutions in the implementation of investment projects. National holding KazAgro also implemented an investment program, for which the state allocated KZT120 billion. This fund will be used for high-tech investment projects including greenhouses, dairy farms, feedlots with developed infrastructure, vegetable and sunflower oil production, drip irrigation technology used in the cultivation of fruit and vegetables, fodder production, the expansion and modernization of poultry production, a network of slaughterhouses, a meat-processing complex capable of vacuum packaging, the production and processing of fine wool, infrastructure development, the export of grain, the creation of production for the assembly of agricultural machinery, and the construction and modernization of silos. These measures will help us identify potential investors for the most promising and economically profitable areas in the context of regional specializations in  Kazakhstan.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the status of the mining sector in Ecuador?</h4><p><span></span>This is the first time that Ecuador has been an attractive market for investments in mining, which entails a lot of challenges. Luckily, the government is fully supporting the industry. We are fortunate to have well-organized legislation, constitutional mining laws, and specific regulations. The government is pushing very hard to promote mining in order to offset the economic challenges the country faces. Although it is an intensive business in terms of capital requirements and operating costs, mining can help to fill the investment gap that we are currently seeing in the Ecuadorean economy. Even though we are carrying out a medium-sized project in Ecuador compared to other mining centers, we are going to be the top gold mining company in the country as soon as we begin operations. Mining is going to lead business development in the future, especially for southern Ecuador. In collaboration with our Chinese colleagues at the Mirador and San Carlos projects, plus other gold projects in Azuay, owned by International Minerals and Iamgold, we expect to represent 5-6% of the country's GDP. We are at the beginning of the mining industry in Ecuador, and this is one reason why Kinross entered the market. One of our goals as a company is to be leaders in any country we are in, and there is a very attractive deposit here, plus excellent exploration potential.</p><h4>Does Kinross anticipate signing a contract with the government?</h4><p>Reaching an agreement between the government and any company is not easy. The main issue is that the country is new to the mining business, and it is a learning process. The government needs to study the business, conduct negotiations, and grant approvals. The Ecuadorean authorities started very enthusiastically, but with limited understanding of the sector. From the company side, we need to ensure we understand the local culture and the political context with regard to private investment in the minerals sector. There are very specific things to be addressed in the mining industry, and our activity requires a huge capital investment. We will be investing more than $1 billion in the country, and many oil companies have not matched this level of investment. We are therefore looking to establish stable rules that will not change over time. Kinross will recover its invested capital after roughly 10 years, and we have been pushing very hard to achieve an acceptable balance between the government and the company regarding economic parameters. Striking a balance between the company's position and the government's viewpoint will take time, but I am optimistic that there will be a successful outcome.</p><div class="quote">“We invested heavily to discover and develop the deposit at Fruta de Norte. To date, we have spent $250 million."</div><h4>Do you believe Ecuador has the potential to become a leading country for the mining industry?</h4><p>Absolutely. I am from Chile and have been in the mining industry for 25 years. Chile had a very similar beginning to Ecuador, but look at where Chile is now after three decades of stable mining development. In Chile the government has established a fair balance between benefits to the government and economic returns to the investor. This is a very good reference for Ecuador to study since it has allowed billions of dollars of foreign investment to come to Chile, generating thousands of jobs and related activity. Investors come to a country and aim to launch a business because there are very profitable resources and opportunities. We have made one of the top-10 gold discoveries in the world over the last 5-10 years in Ecuador, and we can make this business profitable for the government and for Kinross. However, we need to ensure that the investment conditions are attractive for all investors, not just for the biggest and best deposits. Returns are just one part of the investment equation—companies also seek economic and political stability for the future, and must demonstrate their commitment to high social and environmental standards.</p><h4>How important are environmental and social issues in negotiations with the government?</h4><p>If the economic, environmental, and social aspects are driving the business, Ecuador is at the top of the list. Ecuador's regulations are prompting mining countries to be even more demanding, and this is the way Kinross works as well. We have 10 operations distributed around the world, and we keep our business going with social licensing based on environmental concerns, communities, and a strong government relationship; all of these elements need to be balanced. We have been working very closely with environmental entities in the government, and we have reached an even better level of development regarding environmental matters in Ecuador. Mining operations are very specific and we are closely regulated by the environmental authorities. However, there is a lot of capacity building to be done in terms of preparing the authorities to deal with the advanced technology and challenges associated with modern large-scale mining. Kinross is highly supportive of this process. Modern mining is conducted according to best practices in environment and the community. It seems that in Ecuador the debate on mining is highly political, which often results in confused information being present in the media. This places a big challenge on the industry to communicate more about what it does and why it is important to society. In Ecuador Kinross is a founding member of the Council for Responsible Mining, which is dedicated to this task of positioning responsible mining with the public.</p><h4>What are the activities and investments carried out by Kinross thus far in the country?</h4><p>We invested heavily to discover and develop the deposit at Fruta de Norte. To date, we have spent $250 million for the development of the project, and there are no other businesses currently investing at this level. In fact, our projects and investments are unique to the mining industry in Ecuador. The company's money is allocated toward technical decisions in addition to communities, training, and developing local capacities. The gap between our requirements and what the country is able to provide is huge, and so we will start a training center as part of our commitment to the development of human capital. The entire project will take two to three years to complete, and we will be training people constantly. Kinross requires a staff of about 1,000 people for the operation of the mine, and another 1,500 for its construction. In total, we will be training 5,000 local people at the site.</p><h4>According to your discovery in Ecuador, what is the relevance of the country for Kinross' worldwide activities?</h4><p>Ecuador is an incipient market, and we have 35 concessions around the area of the project. Therefore, our geologists anticipate that there might be another Fruta del Norte in close proximity to the original site. If this is the case, we can expect huge growth in the country. Looking at the project ahead and Kinross' future growth, the company produced 2.6 million ounces of gold in 2011 and plans to substantially increase that figure over the next 5 years. If this growth is achieved, Ecuador will represent 10% of Kinross' worldwide activity, making it a very important market. We believe that Ecuador can provide an upside for companies in the future. Over time we will have a better understanding of the local risk, stronger relations with nearby communities, positive management of environmental concerns, and closer connection with government policy, providing better returns for the business. We are also trying to improve our labor efficiency, and improve opportunities for our employees. There is much room for growth not only for us, but for other companies as well. Senior mining companies are starting to move into new countries. For example, we are the first and only senior mining company operating in severe weather conditions in locations such as Siberia. There are many challenges, isolated areas, and difficult access areas in Ecuador, and we anticipate that managing water out of the mine will be one of our main issues. We are starting to reach an acceptable deal, and Kinross will provide other companies a learning curve that leads to better business—not solely from the perspective of shareholders, but in terms of providing social support for an emerging country like Ecuador. We have carried out a value proposal study for the country, which included information regarding poverty, infant mortality, and literacy levels. In the next decade, Kinross, through its contributions to government and support of government policy, can help reduce poverty from 50% to 10% in Zamora Chinchipe (based on comparisons with similar results achieved in the mining regions of Chile). We can also reduce the number of children dying before the age of 1 to near 0%. Our impact could be huge, and the positive change we can bring is enormous.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan will enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) and pursue Eurasian economic integration at the same time. How do these two processes complement each other?</h4><p>The Customs Union (CU) is first and foremost a favorable environment for attracting mutual investments and establishing joint production, taking into account the available economic potential in each state. As a result, a single market for goods without tariff and non-tariff barriers has been created, and entrepreneurs are free to move their goods among the 170 million people in the CU. To date, the process of forming the CU has been completed, and the legal basis, which includes more than 70 international agreements, has been formed. The Common Economic Space (CES) agreements came into force on January 1, 2012, and the parties have proceeded with a closer integration—the building of the CES. Accession to the WTO, as well as formation of the CU and the CES is a priority for our country and for our partners. The process of accession to the WTO began in 1996. Integration into the world trading system is inextricably linked with the formation of the CU. From its inception, the legal framework of the CU and the CES has been built according to the principles of the WTO, and its norms concerning the scope of CU regulations will become part of our legal system. As of today, Kazakhstan has signed protocols on the completion of bilateral negotiations in terms of market access for goods and services with 29 WTO member states. In general, we are confident that negotiations on Kazakhstan's accession to the WTO are in their final stages. Kazakhstan's participation in the work of the WTO will improve not only the competitiveness of the national economy, but of the emerging economies of the CES as well. Our country's entrance into the organization would mean that Kazakhstan is “ready to play by international trade rules."</p><h4>How is Kazakhstan improving its small and medium-sized business base?</h4><p>In order to expand state support for entrepreneurship in the country, the program Business Road Map (BRM) 2020 has been developed and is operating today. The program is a logical continuation of the implementation of our road maps in 2009 and 2010. Meanwhile, the emphasis has shifted to post-crisis development. The measures provided in the BRM 2020 have been used successfully in many countries around the world. One of the other tangible measures that can be taken to improve the business climate in the country is the alleviation of administrative barriers. The Ministry, with the assistance of the World Bank, USAID, and representatives of the business community, have developed plans to adopt a new legislative concept, whereby a single law will determine an exhaustive list of permits with their categorization by degree of risk. The law will also establish uniform requirements for the issuance procedures. Reforming the licensing-permit system will be accompanied by a parallel transfer to an electronic format. At this stage, the government has introduced a draft law to reduce the number of licenses and permits by one-third.</p><div class="quote">“The economy of Kazakhstan in 2012 will be developing under important trends in the world economy."</div><h4>Which segments of the economy have benefited from Eurasian economic integration?</h4><p>Kazakhstan's entry to the CU is already yielding results. Each year, the trade turnover of Kazakhstan within the CU grows by more than 40%. In 2010, turnover increased by 40.5%, and in 2011 by 40.8%. Moreover, the share of trade with Russia and Belarus in Kazakhstan's total turnover has increased from 18.5% in 2010 to 19.4% in 2011. In January 2012, the mutual trade between Kazakhstan and CU countries amounted to $1.4 billion. Thus, the abolition of customs procedures and other control types (except at the border) promotes bilateral trade between our countries. One of the positive aspects is the fact that Kazakhstan has created a more liberal fiscal policy and investment climate than that of its partners in the CU, and therefore has a better chance to attract foreign capital and create joint ventures. In particular, Russian business is attracted by the favorable investment legislation and effective measures designed to support businesses in Kazakhstan. A particularly important aspect is the political and economic stability of the country. For example, individual income tax in Kazakhstan is 10%, and the value-added tax is 12%, while in Russia and Belarus these are higher. The excise tax rate per ton of gasoline in Kazakhstan is KZT5,000, in Russia it is KZT19,000, and in Belarus it is KZT61,000.</p><h4>To what extent will Kazakhstan be affected by a possible second wave of the global financial crisis?</h4><p>At present, Kazakhstan is well prepared for the crisis. To date, the international reserves of the country, including the foreign exchange assets of the National Fund, amount to $80.6 billion. The accumulated financial strength will ensure stable economic development in the future. In the years of previous crises, Kazakhstan gained considerable experience in carrying out anti-crisis measures for the improvement and strengthening of the economy with minimal government interference in market processes.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for the medium term?</h4><p>The economy of Kazakhstan in 2012 will be developing under important trends in the world economy. Squeezed external demand requires adequate measures to accelerate our economic growth through internal resources. We estimate that GDP in 2012 will grow by 6% in real terms compared to the previous year. The main factor behind this growth will be internal demand. The forecast for industrial growth is 3.9%. Growth in this sector should be assured by the outpaced growth rate of the manufacturing sector, which should be around 7.1%. The expansion in the sector is caused by an ongoing trend of high growth in production volumes for the machinery, chemical, and metallurgy sectors, as well as the non-metallurgy mineral production sector. Because of the agriculture sector's dependence on weather conditions and the cyclical nature of harvesting, we forecast a decrease in the harvest index by 13% in 2012. However, the negative tendencies in agriculture will not affect the country's economic growth as a whole. The growth of value-added services in 2012 is predicted to be 8.5%. We also foresee a high growth rate for trade (12.7%), transport (7.9%) and communications (8.2%). Our estimates for inflation are within the forecasted corridor of 6%-8%. Economic growth in 2013-2017 may be more balanced and focused on internal coordination of the sectors in growth rates, which excludes an extreme increase in demand that could be caused by credit activity. Economic growth in 2013-2017 is predicted to be between 6.3% and 7.7%. The main growth factor in 2013-2014 will be internal demand, which may grow by as much as 10.3% on average, and in 2015-2017 by 7.4%. The value of investment inputs in GDP growth is estimated to be higher than that of 2008-2011. As a whole, over the forecast period a high rate of capital savings will occur, with the share of investment in GDP estimated at 30.1% in general.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexico is going through a complex time in terms of security. What is the Mexican government doing to guarantee public security?</h4><p>Security is, indeed, the main challenge we are facing, which is why instead of ignoring it, we have decided to tackle it head on. To do so, we have a comprehensive security policy that includes three basic components: first, to fight and subdue criminals, for which our soldiers, marines, and police officers have come to the aid of the population in those areas where criminals do most harm to society. Our determination has already yielded positive results, such as important arrests and unprecedented seizures of weapons, illicit money, and drugs. Second, we have begun important reforms to purge and strengthen the institutions responsible for security, justice enforcement, and administration. We now have professional police officers and judges who are truly at the service of the public. And third, we are rebuilding the social fabric to offer more scholarships and open more schools for our students, bringing public services to communities that were previously excluded, opening recreational spaces where coexistence will bring society together, and implementing other actions aimed at improving the quality of life of the Mexican people. To summarize, we are tackling this issue from every perspective to build a real rule of law that gives families security and investors legal certainty.</p><h4>What is the economic outlook in Mexico?</h4><p>Since the beginning of my administration at the end of 2006 we began to transform our economy to accelerate growth and increase competitiveness. Thanks to these efforts, Mexico currently has a solid and stable economy, despite the difficult global situation. To give you three important facts: average inflation in the last five years has been less than 5%, which has been the lowest in over four decades. Public debt is approximately 32% of GDP, half the average of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. And international reserves are $152 billion, enough to cover the federal government's foreign debt 2.5 times over. Mexico is currently in a position to grow and face any possible global financial turbulence.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico is opportunity. It is a country with a promising future and a modern and competitive economy."</div><h4>As you mention, competitiveness is a key element to being successful in the global economy. What strategy has Mexico followed to increase the competitiveness of its economy?</h4><p>We have a very clear strategy for increasing our competitiveness and being successful in the global economy. An essential part of achieving this goal has been to invest in one of our main assets: our human capital or, as I like to call it, human value. In recent years, we have improved the coverage and quality of education at every level. We have reached universal coverage in elementary education. In addition, in the last five years we have created close to 1,000 high schools and 105 higher education institutions, 90% of which are oriented to training engineers and technicians. Thanks to this, every year close to 122,000 engineers graduate in Mexico, more than in countries such as Germany, Canada, or Brazil. This results in a young, talented, and highly skilled workforce for anyone who wants to open a business in Mexico. Another area in which we have worked hard is health. We are one step away from reaching universal health coverage: to date, 107 million Mexicans have medical insurance. And to cater to this growing demand for health services, since 2007 we have built 1,100 hospitals and refurbished 2,200 more. In addition, to increase the competitiveness of our economy, over the last five years we have allocated unprecedented resources to the construction of infrastructure. In 2000, average annual investment was approximately 3% of GDP, the same as the OECD average. Currently, it has reached historical levels of 4.4% of GDP. And recently a new Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Law was approved that opens up great business opportunities for businesses that build infrastructure. As a result of this boost to the sector, many international companies are setting up shop in our country because they know that producing in Mexico to export to the US and Europe is now much more profitable and efficient than doing so, for example, in China or Brazil. Another example of actions to raise competitiveness is the elimination of procedures. Never before has there been such a profound effort to eliminate the bureaucratic red tape that was such an obstacle to doing business. This has meant that now entrepreneurs can open a company in less than 10 days, and not 60 as before.</p><h4>In your opinion, what has been the most important change in Mexican society in recent years?</h4><p>Without a doubt, the first is that we have increased the quality of life of the Mexican people. Programs aimed at increasing the income of the country's poorest families have been crucial. Another important transformation is that thanks to the economic stability of recent years, for the first time in several decades we have strengthened the purchasing power of the minimum wage and increased the number of workers who earn higher salaries. This has resulted in a broadening of the middle class that is evident in various indicators. For example, today more families than ever are buying their own homes. In just five years we have granted 6 million credits to acquire or improve public housing. In addition, Mexican homes are acquiring more and more durable goods: most of them have a refrigerator, television, and washing machine, while almost half have a car and telephone line. In other words, Mexico is a global exporting power, but it also has a domestic market that is expanding and provides great opportunities for doing business.</p><h4>Why should investors around the world choose Mexico as a business destination?</h4><p>Mexico is opportunity. It is a country with a promising future and a modern and competitive economy thanks to the talent and preparation of the Mexican people. I am convinced that this is the best time to invest here because of the great advantages for doing business offered by Mexico. An example is the stability of our economy, which protects us against complex global financial scenarios and, therefore, offers companies an environment of certainty in which to flourish. In addition, we are a real world-class exporting power: in 2011, our exports reached $377 billion, while our share in US imports went from 10.5% in 2005 to approximately 13% in 2011. We are a country that believes in free trade; we have signed free trade agreements with more than 40 countries, gaining preferential access to a potential market of more than 1 billion consumers around the world. Currently, the Mexican government has become an ally for entrepreneurs. Like many other emerging economies that suffer the consequences of insecurity, Mexico has decided to face this challenge and establish lasting solutions. Because of that, what today might be considered an issue for Mexico will be one of its great strengths in the future: a solid rule of law. Furthermore, we go to great lengths to improve the quality of life of all Mexicans, and that means investing in our human capital. Because of all this, Mexico is an opportunity for global companies seeking attractive and profitable investment destinations. It is an opportunity for entrepreneurs who want to expand their businesses. And it is an opportunity to develop businesses that will be successful competitors in the global markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core of the UAE foreign trade policy, and to what extent is local economic openness paving the way for wider regional growth?</h4><p>The UAE's foreign trade policy is geared towards economic openness to the world and productive interaction with its global trade partners. It is founded on the principles of parity and mutual interests. The decision to nurture an open economy was wisely made by our Founding Fathers led by our late President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan from our country's inception. Even then they knew that an open economy is vital to the UAE's commercial ties at the regional and international levels. An open economy has helped the UAE gain the confidence of global investors and businesses and has accelerated the nation's economic diversification efforts. It has also boosted local competition, job creation, and the options of goods and services that UAE citizens can choose from. An open economy has been vital to our resilience against the global downturn and the social movements that have posed numerous economic challenges to the region and the world.</p><h4>What is the UAE's strategy for developing its own unique brand in an increasingly spirited economic regional market?</h4><p>Our economic resilience speaks for itself and sets us apart from the regional market. While the world has been struggling to address a four-year downturn, we have been focusing on sustaining our positive growth. While other parts of the region had to contend with various economically harmful social movements, we continued forward with our socio-economic developments. This is our greatest edge: our unwavering ability to provide a safe and secure environment for business, trade, and social interaction.</p><h4>Following successful diversification of the UAE economy, which sectors hold the biggest growth potential for both trade and investment?</h4><p>The industrial sector shows very promising potential. Last year the UAE's industrial activities expanded by almost 11% to remain the second largest component of our GDP after hydrocarbons. The manufacturing sector in fact accounted for a record $38.8 billion in 2011. The transport sector is another rewarding area for trade and investment as it expanded by 6% last year. And so is renewable energy, especially as we are now the official headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The UAE has already adopted a plan to raise the contribution of the renewable energy sector by up to 7% of national energy requirements by 2020. SMEs represent yet another solid sector, accounting for over 70% of the UAE's GDP, excluding oil, and thus considered the backbone of the national economy. Other recommended sectors include tourism, finance and banking, education, health, logistic services, and ports and airports.</p><div class="quote">“The UAE's foreign trade policy is geared towards economic openness to the world and productive interaction."</div><h4>Which countries currently present particularly interesting opportunities for bilateral trade growth with the UAE?</h4><p>We are eyeing countries in regions such as Latin America, Africa, and Central Asia with high growth rates, large and expanding populations, stable economic and political environments, forward-looking policies, and a clear vision of FDI with other countries. These growth partners uphold laws for protecting investors, widening investments, and expanding trade. We also intend to broaden our bilateral trade with strategic partners such as India, China, and Korea.</p><h4>How important a role do SMEs play in utilizing opportunities and strengthening bilateral trade between countries?</h4><p>SMEs represent around 70% of our GDP, and so any country tapping into our SME sector would be engaging with the backbone of our economy. SMEs are major users of imported goods and also account for a large exporting group, and so they are vital to strengthening bilateral trade. Companies falling under the SME category face a lot of financial and policy challenges that the UAE is keen to address. Governments should introduce supportive policies that make it easier for SMEs to expand and enhance their operations and enter international markets. For its part, the UAE aims to create a supportive environment where SMEs can easily avail of the right financial, training, and knowledge resources. We recognize the positive value of SMEs in our national economy.</p><h4>What will be the focus of the 2012 Annual Investment Meeting? What makes the UAE such an ideal location for international economic forums and events?</h4><p>The UAE is an excellent host for international dialogues and events due to its strategic geographic location between the East and West. As the region's recognized commercial hub, it also provides an ideal setting for businesses to interact and deal with each other. It offers many world-class venues such as the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre and the Dubai World Trade Center as well. The country's thriving MICE industry is considered an important medium for showing the UAE's push away from oil toward a more diversified economy.</p><h4>The UAE joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1996, and a number of WTO reports have since been issued evidencing the country's commitment to creating an open international trade environment. What measures continue to be implemented in this regard?</h4><p>During our second Trade Policy Review (TPR) under the WTO we were commended for upholding free-market principles and for aggressively pursuing economic diversification. We are committed to continue implementing measures that sustain the positive world view over our open trade environment. For one, we continue to update and improve our economic and legislative laws to fortify our open market. Building on the strong approval of the WTO over our latest TPR, we also intend to provide more information on our trade policy and deliver on our obligations to the WTO. We will continue to work with the WTO Secretariat and benefit from the expertise and technical assistance it extends. Since 2011 we have not raised our tariffs beyond 4.9% to float us above the global crisis without compromising our trade liberalization. This strategy has worked well alongside our simple tariff structure and our minimal non-tariff barriers, and will continue to be in force. Of course, we will also maintain our business-friendly environment and free trade zones, which have carved for us a successful model for investment promotion.</p><h4>As the first female UAE minister and an inspirational role model for young Emirati women, what advice would you impart to budding young female entrepreneurs?</h4><p>I would advise them to aim high and not set limits to what they can achieve; the region has made great strides in opening up opportunities to our sisters. I would like to remind them that women possess many unique traits, such as exceptional interpersonal skills, persuasiveness, adaptability, team spirit, and confident decision-making, which make us excellent entrepreneurs. I would also warn them not to fall into the trap of competing against men. Their greatest competition is themselves. They should work with men for the betterment of society.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges you have faced as Mayor of Quito?</h4><p>Quito is similar to many cities in Latin America, in that it has experienced aggressive growth. By the mid-20th century, Quito's population stood at 250,000 or 300,000 people; in the last census we counted approximately 2.3 million. This means that over the course of 60 or 70 years the population has multiplied by 10, which is a very sharp increase. In the 2001 census, Quito recorded 1.8 million people, which means we are registering growth of 50,000 people per year. These demographics present a challenge in terms of the demand for public services, but we have overcome many obstacles. Quito has an extensive water network, covering close to 97% of its area, and sewage systems cover over 91%. Our domestic garbage collection covers 96% of the population. In service supply, we exceed the national average with numbers closer to those seen in cities in Europe. Quito is a capital city with a strong political debate, important government presence, and 23 universities, and we are observing a demographic transformation process. In Quito, we enjoy a deeper notion of modernism, culture, and architecture, and the city has also grown economically over the past few years owing to investments in mobility and social promotion.</p><h4>What impact will the new airport have on the city's tourism and commerce?</h4><p>We have huge expectations, as the city has demanded the airport for many years. Quito plays an important role as a tourist destination and an exporter. Quito and the surrounding region have become the largest exporters of flowers, for example. The airport will have an impact on passenger traffic and cargo. We aim to strengthen the export capacity of flowers and traditional products such as handicrafts, as well as non-traditional farming products, which will have a major impact on the economy and the dynamics of the market. In 2011, we served 5.4 million passengers at the Mariscal Sucre International Airport and received almost 500,000 tourists to the city, demonstrating our growth and expansion. The largest transformation of the city has yet to be seen, as the current airport will feature an exit in the north of the city, where tourism will expand. Currently, the airport functions as a virtual barrier between the west and east, and the new exit of the airport will allow us to build a 150-hectare park, reconfigure the city, offer denser services, and make the city more compact.</p><div class="quote">“Quito is similar to many cities in Latin America, in that it has experienced aggressive growth."</div><h4>What will the subway's main characteristics be and how will it affect the city's mobility?</h4><p>We are working on the structure of the transport corridors. Over the past two years, we have doubled the transport capacity of buses and trolleys. The spine of our system will be the subway, which is in the final stages of analysis. The first stage measured the feasibility of the project, presented in July 2011. The project was proposed by the Metro of Madrid and the analysis offered clear conclusions. We have to install a high-capacity system, structured with the physical unification of the transportation network. We determined that Quito is the ideal city for a subway due to its long shape and the limitation of operating conventional bus services. Currently we are involved in a two-part stage, which includes finishing our detailed research on engineering and the location of stops. We are hoping to formally announce the specifications of the system. Our preliminary figures suggest that the subway will be 22 kilometers long with 15 stops and 106 wagons, and it will take 24 minutes to travel from Labrador to Quitumbe station, and transport 370,000 people daily in its first year. The construction of two multimodal stations will be put to the test in mid-2012. We will start construction work in the third quarter, as the conceptual stages of the project will be completed in August.</p><h4>What are the main advantages that Quito offers to foreign investors?</h4><p>There are several advantages. Currently, much of the foreign investment is geared toward the airport and subway projects. Quito boasts excellent competitiveness, with educated people, trained professionals, and excellent services. We also have a strong legal process with clear laws; there is legal security because our regulations are respected, which is key for investment. We are also developing a process to set up key investment factors. Through the program, companies can earn what we call a “Seal of Prioritized Investment," which is designed to accelerate the bureaucratic processes. A number of investments have this seal, which makes them agile. We are organizing the city by industrial areas, which is also key for investment. Many of the risks people face when they make investments involve sustainability and the environment, and we are reconfiguring these areas to increase security. Finally, we have an outstanding cultural agenda. We are the perfect size, with the advantage of a metropolis that is centrally located without the complexities of a huge population.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Jumeirah Group has established some of the world's most iconic hotels. What role has the group played in the rise of Dubai as a luxury holiday destination?</h4><p>Since the opening of our first property, Jumeirah Beach Hotel, in 1997, we have worked closely with both Emirates Airlines and the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing to promote Dubai as a luxury travel destination. The opening of our flagship hotel, Burj Al Arab, in 1999, followed by the opening of Madinat Jumeirah in 2004, reinforced Dubai's image as a world-class year-round holiday destination. As the Jumeirah and Emirates brands expand their global reach, we are continuing to promote Dubai in new overseas markets, such as China, Russia, Brazil, and the US.</p><h4>Where is the group planning to expand and why?</h4><p>When we began our international expansion in 2005, we identified the “key letterhead cities" around the world, which became the priority destinations for our expansion. Just like an airline, a successful hotel brand should be represented in a number of “tier one" locations, such as London, Frankfurt, Shanghai, and New York. Over the past 12 months we have reinforced our presence in Europe by opening five new hotels: Jumeirah Frankfurt, Jumeirah Grand Hotel Via Veneto in Rome, Jumeirah Port Soller Hotel &amp; Spa in Mallorca, Pera Palace Hotel Jumeirah in Istanbul, and Grosvenor House Apartments by Jumeirah Living in London. Going forward we plan to open new hotels in the Asia-Pacific and MENA regions to ensure that our brand is represented in all key markets. Over the past year, we have expanded our portfolio internationally from 10 hotels at the beginning of 2011 to over 20 hotels at the beginning of 2012. These include new properties in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, the Maldives, Shanghai, Frankfurt, Istanbul, London, Mallorca, and Rome. Jumeirah is now taking its place in the top echelons of the luxury hotel industry, and we are well on our way to becoming one of the leading luxury brands worldwide.</p><div class="quote">“Our hotels in Dubai are the market leaders in terms of occupancy rates and revenue per available room."</div><h4>Competition in luxury tourism in Dubai is fierce. How has Jumeirah Group managed to maintain its position at the head of the industry?</h4><p>Our hotels in Dubai are the market leaders in terms of occupancy rates and revenue per available room (RevPAR). The beachfront resorts recorded extended periods of full occupancy averaging at 84.4% during the first four months of 2012, while RevPAR—the industry standard for measuring revenue in relation to rooms available—has grown by 18.7%. Jumeirah's city hotels have also regained their leading position with an average occupancy rate of 85.5% and RevPAR growth of 8.4%. Over the years, our hotels and resorts have gained a reputation as the finest in the city, and therefore, we enjoy a high ratio of return guests. Sirius, our loyalty program, has also proved to be highly successful. Jumeirah has also hosted and sponsored a number of prestigious events that truly showcase the very best of the properties and the destination. These include Art Dubai, which takes place in Madinat Jumeirah every year, and the Dubai International Film Festival. On the sponsorship side, Jumeirah is very proud of the achievements of Rory McIlroy, our Global Brand Ambassador, who is now recognized not only as one of the top golfers in the world, but as one of the top sports personalities.</p><h4>How have the demands of luxury travelers evolved in Dubai?</h4><p>While luxury travelers have become more sophisticated in their demands, they have also become more aware of the potential socio-economic benefits of travel and tourism. Many of our guests in Dubai choose to enrich their beach holidays with cultural experiences. That is why we began our collaboration with Sheikh Mohammed's Centre for Cultural Understanding and can now invite our guests to visit the Jumeirah Mosque where they can learn more about Islam and its traditions. Jumeirah has also launched a number of culturally focused activities across its hotels in Dubai, such as traditional pearl diving and art programs.</p><h4>What role has the food and beverage aspect of the group's operations play in the business?</h4><p>The business of food and beverage has been an essential part of Jumeirah's success. We now operate over 100 restaurants, bars, and lounges in our hotels in Dubai. We also have a dedicated restaurant division, which is in charge of a number of restaurant licenses. Some of these have been developed in-house, such as the noodle house, which is now represented on a franchise basis in a number of countries in the Middle East, and will soon be opening outlets in the UK, Russia, and Morocco. Additionally, Jumeirah operates several restaurants under a license agreement with Caprice Holding, such as The Ivy Dubai, The Rivington Grill, and Scott's, which is due to open later this year at Jumeirah at Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. These restaurants provide an authentic London dining experience and have proved very popular with our guests.</p><h4>What are the aims of the Global Arts and Culture platform initiative?</h4><p>Our guests have a wide range of interests and come from all over the world. We are delighted when we can help them connect to a creative community they may not have previously been aware of. We support these creative communities in ways that enhance the guest experience, while creating new opportunities for artists and providing a bridge for ideas and people within the hotel environment. Our hotels are magnets for culture, and today's travelers crave a place where exciting art, elegant design, luxury service, and the exchange of interesting ideas can all mix. We have been actively collaborating with local artists in New York, a dedicated art curator based in Jumeirah Essex House, and the official hosts of the world-famous annual Art Dubai week at Madinat Jumeirah. This is the largest and most established contemporary art fair in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. Art Dubai features over 75 galleries from 32 countries, showing work by over 500 artists. Our newest hotels in Abu Dhabi, Shanghai, Frankfurt, Rome, Istanbul, and Mallorca also feature a number of original artworks displayed prominently in public areas as well as guest rooms. In addition, we recently announced the winner of the second Jumeirah Group Arts and Culture Award, presented at the 16th annual Luxury Briefing Awards in London. The Arts and Culture Award celebrates leading international enterprises that are supporting artists and advancing artistic practice through innovative creative collaborations in the business arena. This installment of the award was given to Montblanc for its Young Artist World Patronage.</p><h4>Dubai is also a hub for MICE tourism. Is this an important revenue generator for Jumeirah?</h4><p>MICE tourism forms an integral part of our business. Jumeirah offers one of the largest MICE facilities in the region and we are delighted with the results we achieve. Our hotels in Dubai host a number of high-profile events, such as the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council meetings, the Arabian Hotel Investment Conference, Leaders in Dubai, and Dubai International Film Festival.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As one of the first investment companies to come to Turkey from the GCC countries, what have been your most successful investments?</h4><p>This is Turkapital's fourth year—we started operations in 2008. Given the circumstances and the environment globally, ours has been a success story. We're seeing that many of our peers, investment houses, and companies operating in the same market have lost their capital. In our case our capital has been preserved and we're growing. Over the last four years of operations we have acquired an auto fleet and leasing company, Autoland. It began 2012 with 3,500 cars, but when we bought it in 2008, it had only 150 cars. We acquired it with very small investment of around $1 million. We injected the capital and then grew the company. Our plans for 2012 and beyond are to grow and reach 5,000 more cars.</p><h4>What about other fields?</h4><p>We have established an insurance company called Neova. This is a huge challenge, but I think it will be one of the best performers under Turkapital. The company's first year of operation was 2010, and we closed 2010 with about TL60 million in revenues and premiums. For 2011, we closed with about TL90 million in revenues.</p><div class="quote">“Given the circumstances and the environment globally, ours has been a success story."</div><h4>What's behind this success?</h4><p>We have an edge and it's helping, which is that we use Kuveyt Türk's branches as our sales points, but we're also accessing the other participation banks and their branches. We have signed with Al Baraka Turk, which means 150 branches, and Türkiye Finans has another 120 branches, and so on. We have almost 400 branches that Neova uses as its sales points. In addition, there are around 300-400 agents nation wide. It is this network that has yielded such incredible results.</p><h4>In which other countries in the region does Turkapital have significant investment?</h4><p>We use Turkey as our base, but we have been looking at Central Asia, and we have acquired a shopping mall in Azerbaijan, which is performing very well. We have an office in Baku and we are looking at more assets to book and to expand. We also have an office in Tatarstan. Russia is a little bit challenging—we have been there for about three years and we haven't booked any assets. Luckily, the office is small, so we don't incur many costs and we hope to see something happening in Russia and Tatarstan, especially over the next six months to a year. There is good potential and Tatarstan will also host the 2013 World Student Games, which opens a lot of potential for development. We hadn't looked at Eastern Europe in our first four years, so we did a fact-finding trip to Bosnia and Croatia, and there are some good opportunities there. We are now studying up, but we haven't committed or decided what to do yet. However, there are some good opportunities coming up, hopefully.</p><h4>How does Turkapital work with Turkey's dynamic economy?</h4><p>As far as the Turkish lira and the other economical ups and downs are concerned, this is part of the market dynamic and we do what it takes to adapt whether it's hedging or whatever else it takes. We are part of the market and we are living with the market—we try and take good advantage of any opportunities we see, but at this point we see everything as an opportunity. In 2001 when the major crisis hit Turkey, Kuveyt Türk came out winning and gaining as there was a run on the banks and people wanted their money and wanted their deposits. The banks were so scared and concerned that they were losing their funds. In our case, we paid every single penny to every depositor. Even those whose deposits that were not mature, they wanted their money before time we gave it to them. It gave our clients confidence and it showed them our strength. We try to take advantage of all the opportunities and also to be prepared for any crisis or hiccup in the market.</p><h4>Are you still looking for new projects within Turkey?</h4><p>In general terms, our interest in private equity and real estate will continue. We also see more sectors opening up to private equity. Istanbul is almost like a country on its own. There is always demand for improved living standards, housing standards, and so on. Smaller housing units for families are in demand near shopping centers, and we will also be looking into opportunities there.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How developed are the UAE accounting standards requirements for auditing practices?</h4><p>Presently, the Commercial Companies Laws do not specify any accounting standards framework for the preparation of financial statements. The Central Bank of the UAE has made it mandatory for banks to prepare their accounts as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Listed companies prepare their accounts as per IFRS. In the absence of any specific standards framework in the UAE, most of the practicing firms apply IFRS in the preparation of audited financial statements, and apply International Standards of Auditing in the conduct of the audit of financial statements. The Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) of the Land Department also recommends that the financial statements of buildings owners' associations should be prepared according to IFRS.</p><h4>Did the global economic crisis place greater importance on the need for strong internal auditing and risk management procedures?</h4><p>As economic conditions change, so too must risk management priorities. That is why internal auditors should consider—first and foremost—whether they are aligned with the strategy and direction of the company. By focusing on the company's long-term strategy, understanding the impact of short-term initiatives on this strategy, and aligning itself accordingly, the internal audit function can better position itself to monitor and address risk management activities throughout the organization.</p><div class="quote">“As economic conditions change, so too must risk management priorities."</div><h4>How is the Strata Titled and Jointly Owned Property legislation governed in Dubai, and how prevalent is this type of ownership in the Emirate? What kind of auditing issues should owners be aware of?</h4><p>Dubai's Jointly Owned Property Law (Law No. 27 of 2007) establishes a framework for the development and sub-division of developments into such units and common parts, with the sub-division known as “jointly owned property." Each development in Dubai comprises not only a number of units, but also common parts designed for common use by unit owners and occupants. Regulations have been introduced to enforce the law, and among other things, they provide that an owners' association of all the unit owners is responsible for the management, operation, and maintenance of common areas. For each development, the developer must file a “jointly-owned property declaration" with the Land Department. RERA made it mandatory to submit the annual audited financial statements of owners' associations.</p><h4>In terms of business challenges, what sort of reforms to the framework do you think would enhance the development and resilience of the economy?</h4><p>The reform of insolvency and creditor/debtor regimes can improve economic efficiencies and strengthen market resilience in times of crisis. Reforming the insolvency law to provide a clear, predicable, and transparent means for a company to reorganize would benefit the national economy and all UAE companies by reducing the cost of capital for UAE companies over the medium to long term. A bankruptcy law already exists. However, it has not been tested by any company, which means there is much uncertainty in legal circles about how it could be applied in reality. Best practice corporate governance provisions can play an important role in stimulating investment in the UAE and enhancing the confidence of investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Spain is the leading European investor in Mexico, while Mexico is the fourth most important destination for Spanish investment. How does the new Spanish government assess economic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Mexico is certainly a strategic economic partner for Spain. On a commercial level, today it is our first export market in Latin America and fifth worldwide, if we exclude Europe. In 2011 about 10,000 Spanish companies exported to Mexico. In terms of investment, Spain has long been established as the second largest investor in Mexico after the US, with investments of more than $40 billion made over the last decade. This investment is also very diversified; it has been distributed in virtually all industries and services across all the states of Mexico. In fact, Mexico is our third most important destination outside the EU, just behind the US and Brazil. This kind of investment creates competition, facilitates technology transfer, and creates jobs across the country. In fact, Spanish companies are perfectly integrated into the economic and trading structure in Mexico, a country that is also a major investor in Spain. Large Mexican companies have invested over ‚¬4 billion in our country over the last decade. Our aim is to further strengthen our economic ties and boost investment from Mexican companies; we are an ideal platform for them to enter the European market.</p><h4>Why is Mexico such an attractive destination for Spanish investment?</h4><p>Mexico is the 14th largest economy in the world and the second largest in Latin America, and it is very attractive for foreign investment, according to the latest UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) figures, which position Mexico as the second best destination for FDI in Latin America, just behind Brazil. The size of the Mexican economy, its population of over 112 million inhabitants, its income per capita, economic stability, and economic openness established through an extensive network of free trade treaties are just some of the factors that explain the extraordinary attractiveness of the country. Along with all these elements, I would like to emphasize that in our particular case, there is a long and extraordinary relationship that unites both countries. Spanish companies see Mexico as a natural commercial destination, where the brand Spain is highly recognized and welcomed. All these factors have encouraged a strong presence of large Spanish companies in Mexico, and are also attracting many SMEs.</p><h4>How has the free trade agreement between the EU and Mexico stimulated relations between Mexico and Spain over the last decade? What impact will the Joint Executive Plan of the Mexico-EU Strategic Partnership have?</h4><p>The entry into force of the agreement between the EU and Mexico opened, without a shadow of a doubt, new perspectives in our bilateral relationship. From an economic and trade point of view, the EU-Mexico free trade treaty has significantly improved the access of goods and services to both markets, considerably increasing trade figures in recent years. For example, at the end of 2011 the EU exported $37.5 billion to Mexico, which represented an increase of up to 45% since 2005, whereas Mexican exports to the EU in the same period grew by 108%. Within the EU, Spain is Mexico's first customer, and in 2011 Mexico purchased goods and services worth $4.9 billion: a figure only behind the US, Canada, and China. We are also the third biggest European provider for Mexico with sales of $3.85 billion in 2011, just behind Germany and Italy. The Joint Executive Plan approved in 2010 will be another step in  bilateral relations between Mexico and the EU, incorporating many priority issues on the international agenda such as climate change, human rights, and security issues.</p><div class="quote">“In terms of investment, Spain has long been established as the second largest investor in Mexico after the US."</div><h4>In your opinion, how will Mexico's presidency of the G20 this year improve its international image?</h4><p>Mexico holds all the prerequisites and conditions for its presidency of the G20 to be a complete success. Consistency of macroeconomic management and experience in crisis management provides it with extraordinary credibility. I'm sure it will demonstrate its leadership and its capacity to build a tangible and beneficial consensus to the international community.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

What role has Emaar Properties played in this?</h4><p>The most significant contribution of Emaar to Dubai is in supporting the city's social and economic growth through the creation of prime real estate assets that add to the civic pride of the city. We provide the residents of our integrated communities with a sense of belonging, creating thousands of new jobs across the property, hospitality and leisure segments, as well as in shopping malls through retail development, thus driving the growth of ancillary industries. Since its inception in 1997, Emaar has been a true partner in Dubai's growth, led by the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. With the government of Dubai owning over 30% of the equity of the company, it makes sense for us to grow in our home market. Our development approach complements the growth outlook of Dubai, and through our projects we have contributed to further strengthening the traditional growth sectors of the Emirate—especially in retail, hospitality, and tourism. This is underlined by strong visitor numbers to The Dubai Mall, which welcomed more than 54 million visitors in 2011, contributing significantly to Dubai's retail sector. Visitor numbers to the mall were over 16 million in 1Q2012, an increase of 22% compared with the same period in 2011, highlighting the strong growth in retail and leisure that contributes to Dubai's economy. Our hospitality business, through our Address Hotels and other leisure assets, also complement the city's tourism sector, having recorded robust occupancy levels through 2011. It achieved a 92% occupancy rate in 1Q2012. In the property sector, Emaar brought a new dynamic to the city by pioneering the concept of integrated lifestyle communities. Since 2001, we have handed over more than 33,500 residential units that are today part of established and sought-after integrated lifestyle communities. A highlight of Emaar's approach to developing integrated lifestyle destinations is Downtown Dubai, a 500-acre mega-project described as “The Centre of Now." The $20 billion Downtown Dubai development features several architectural and engineering landmarks such as Burj Khalifa, which features the world's first Armani Hotel Dubai and the world's highest restaurant, At.mosphere; The Dubai Mall—the world's largest shopping and entertainment destination; and The Dubai Fountain, the world's tallest performing fountain set in a 30 acre lake, in addition to residential, commercial, and leisure components.</p><h4>How important a role does Dubai continue to play as a hub for Emaar in terms of its regional operations?</h4><p>Dubai is our home market and we have a robust portfolio of projects in the pipeline in the city. In Dubai, we also see continued growth in our retail and hospitality and leisure businesses, which further assists in the increased ability of Emaar to create superior assets and landmark developments across its international projects. Dubai will continue to be a central hub for our operations even as we expand to other global markets. Already, we have a strong footprint across several markets spanning the Middle East, North Africa, pan-Asia, Europe, and North America. The company has established operations in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, India, Pakistan, Turkey, China, the US, and Canada. We have also highlighted our commitment to project delivery by handing over homes in our master-planned communities in Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, and Pakistan, as well as commercial offices in Syria. The strong fundamentals that we have built up over the years have enabled us to finance projects in our international markets, as well as utilize the expertise available in Dubai for our regional projects. This, in turn, has provided us a competitive edge over local developers, by continuously developing superior developments.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai is our home market and we have a robust portfolio of projects in the pipeline in the city."</div><h4>Emaar works closely with the Dubai Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) to improve corporate governance in the sector. What recent developments have been made in this regard?</h4><p>Emaar works closely with all governmental authorities including RERA, the Dubai Municipality, and other related departments. We pioneered interim owner associations in our communities, with the residents themselves taking an active role in enhancing the long-term welfare of their neighborhoods in association with Emaar's Community Management Department. Emaar has been one of the first companies to comply with all RERA regulations for the launch of our recent project—Panorama at The Views. The development has been registered with the Dubai Land Department, and all units are listed on the Land Department's registry. Emaar also set up a dedicated escrow account for Panorama at The Views, with 20% of the construction value deposited as a bank guarantee. All sales proceeds will be deposited in this escrow account, which will be used only for construction purposes. Customers will pay based on the percentage completion of construction, providing significant protection to investors and financial flexibility. Emaar also works with RERA, and is handling various customer concerns and developing superior policies and regulations to safeguard investor interests.</p><h4>There remains a need for greater liquidity in the sector to drive market growth. Do you foresee banks in the region lowering the cost of property financing?</h4><p>With the real estate sector gaining positive trends in 2012, there is stronger interest from the banks and financial institutions to offer value home finance packages. The banks have started offering home financing at 4.5% to 5.5% interest per annum. This is significantly lower than interest rates in 2010 and in earlier years.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-change]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have things changed since the oil contracts were renegotiated in 2010?</h4><p>The change is pretty important at a global level, because there are very few contracts like the ones we have, based on rate per barrel. In the beginning, we encountered some resistance after a relatively difficult set of negotiations. We reached an agreement with 12 out of the 17 companies that work in Ecuador, and these companies are now planning to invest a further $1.4 billion over the next three years. The situation is fine, the companies are happy, and so are we, because the rate means a ceiling for company incomes when the price goes up, and the entire surplus goes to the state. In 2011, we obtained $1.5 billion in net profit from these negotiations. In 2012 the figure could be higher, because prices are rising. The price at the time of negotiation was $72 per barrel, and the companies have a rate of $32. The price rose from $72 to $103, which represented a huge profit for the country. The companies are now very interesting in continuing with this model, though with some changes, and these will be discussed during the 11th round of negotiations, which we will open in May 2012.</p><h4>What are your perspectives for the exploration and production (E&amp;P) round of negotiations?</h4><p>We have a dozen national oil companies (NOCs) interested, but have not opened up discussion yet with private companies, thought they have come to see us in an unofficial capacity. There are Canadian companies, US companies, Argentinian companies, and more. The contracts on offer will be service contracts for the provision of services at a specified rate, and the rate will be determined according to the level of risk. There will be a tender, and the company that takes the lowest level of risk will win. There will be four blocks reserved for NOCs and 10 for private companies.</p><div class="quote">“The Refinery of the Pacific is important, and we will finish the basic engineering works in May 2012."</div><h4>Regarding EP Petroecuador's mature fields, are there any new international companies coming in?</h4><p>So far, we have signed for two fields with consortiums led by Tecpetrol at the Libertador field, and Schlumberger at the Shushufindi field. There are still two fields, Cuyabeno-Sansaguay and Auca, which are still under negotiation with Halliburton. We are negotiating the rates and the legal composition of the consortium that will sign with that company.</p><h4>How will planned refinery upgrade works progress in 2012?</h4><p>The Refinery of the Pacific is important, and we will finish the basic engineering works in May 2012, and by October we hope to finalize the project financing. There are several options, but the main one is to find an equity partner for EP Petroecuador and Petroleum of Venezuela (PDVSA) to reduce the capital outlaw of direct investment. At the Esmeraldas Refinery, works will cost around $900 million, and should be complete by the end of 2013. The upgrade program basically involves a refurbishing and restructuring of the refinery's facilities. In addition, we have a project to develop improved products, which involves a further investment of around $600 million. There is also another project to double the capacity of the Shushufindi Refinery. In total, refined capacity will increase to close to 45,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) by the end of 2016.</p><h4>After the Colombian President's last visit to Ecuador, the idea of connecting the OCP Pipeline to Colombia was reinforced. At what stage of the plan and investment are we at now?</h4><p>We have already signed a bi-national agreement, which is the most important part at the government level. At the moment, the OCP is directly negotiating with the private companies and Copetrol to evaluate the quantity and rates. The last step would be to agree on income with the Colombian producers over the government's stake in the OCP Pipeline. Things are going very well so far, and we hope that by October 2012 the first barrels from Colombia will start flowing.</p><h4>Regarding mining activities, the government just signed a completely new contract model with EcuaCorriente. How are the negotiations with other mining companies continuing?</h4><p>Contrary to what happens with oil, where we have extensive experience and capacity and have signed contracts for service provisions with two state companies, we are beginners in the mining sector. We can't sign contracts that demand maturity. We have a classic contract for mining exploitation rights, where we only request the tax system conditions regarding income, and international standards of mining exploitation are followed in the form of a concession agreement. We have signed with EcuaCorriente, which is the first company, and we hope to reach an agreement with Canadian company Kinross in 2012. Apart from the negotiations, there is an administrative procedure that could take a bit longer, but we hope that by the middle of the year everything will be finalized. And there is a third small contract for the Rio Blanco field with another Canadian company, IMC, which will be defined in May. In 2013 we intend to sign two more with EcuaCorriente in Panantza-San Carlos, another copper deposit, and with IMC in Quimsacocha. They are now in the advanced exploration phase, and they will move on to the exploitation phase by next year.</p><h4>To find and train human resources is one of the main challenges for the mining sector in the country. What specific plans have been put in place?</h4><p>We are running an accelerated training program, and sending people to Chile, Peru, and Canada on the mining side, and the same on the oil side to the US, Norway, and other producer countries. To achieve that we have set an annual rate of 1% for service companies to dedicate to the training of their staff.</p><h4>You have recently found new offshore gas reserves in Ecuador. Is it a substantial discovery?</h4><p>We have produced gas in small quantities for over a decade, at a rate of 30 million cubic feet per day, or around 5,000-6,000 bbl/d. However, our exploration activities gave us hope that we could triple this production within a year. The estimated reserves nowadays mean we could produce 10 times more than we do today. However, to achieve that, we need to make certain additional verifications. With SIPEC from Chile and the additional exploration performed by EP Petroecuador, we will probably achieve levels of production equivalent to 50,000 bbl of oil in the medium term.</p><h4>What impact will increasing oil prices have?</h4><p>In terms of private production, if the average price is around $100/bbl, it means that we will earn $30 additionally on what was renegotiated in 2010 for every barrel. If we multiply this by 50 million bbl, this is an additional $1.5 billion. According to contracts, we expect to export around 125 million bbl in 2012, totaling $12.5 billion.</p><h4>How much could mining activities represent for the country's GDP in the years to come?</h4><p>EcuaCorriente should start producing by the last quarter of 2013, with 30,000 tons of processing, which is one-third of its total potential, and then start increasing until it reaches 60,000 tons. By the end of 2014, we estimate a benefit in royalties of around $45 million per year plus taxes, meaning around $300 million per year. The same is true regarding Kinross and Rio Blanco. So, as a whole, we will receive around $500 million per year by 2014.</p><h4>What will be the role of the national mining company ENAMI?</h4><p>ENAMI is becoming very strong in the gold industry. It already has eight concessions in Esmeraldas, and will enter strongly in the exploitation area and be a remedy for illegal mining activity. We will start collaborating with companies in mining services that will provide high-tech machinery and working methods. It also has, at this moment, three concessions for non-metallic minerals, which will rise to four in the future. The strategy is to create mixed economy companies, and in the first phase develop ENAMI before it can fly alone, because it demands a lot of resources and time. We hope that within a single generation the company is able to become what EP Petroecuador or Petroamazonas EP represent in the oil sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has the Ecuadorean Social Security Institution Bank (BIESS) achieved in its first year of operations?</h4><p>The last 12 months have been very positive; we have not only achieved all of our planned goals, but surpassed them. Our operations in 2011 were 60% higher than the previous year. We have generated an increase in construction through mortgage loans and consumer credit. We have allocated a total of $1.6 billion in mortgage loans, starting in June 2008 with Ecuadorean Social Security Institution (IESS), and now as BIESS. Our portfolio of unsecured loans is close to $1.2 billion, which makes us one of the most important players in the market.</p><h4>How was the transition process from IESS to BIESS, and why was the decision made to change from one type of institution to the other?</h4><p>IESS is a tremendously large institution with a lot of responsibilities and unlimited requirements, because it has to attend to one of the most basic human needs, which is health. Years ago, the IESS health service was inadequate, and the improvements that have been implemented over the last four years are helping people to trust the IESS again. This has generated more pressure on those services, which have already been improved need to keep improving, and it is very hard to close the gap. An institution with such a large operating budget has to invest time in the management of its finances, but all of the IESS' time was taken up with the managing of health services. Therefore, the need arose to separate the financial part and house it in a dedicated financial institution, hence the bank.</p><h4>To what extent are you involved in investment banking?</h4><p>We are very active and firm believers in the stock market. We expected to end 2011 with funds amounting to $7.8 billion, of which 40% is dedicated to the public sector. These are investments that have been made in the public sector, especially in bonds issued by the Ecuadorean government. We have invested a total of $3.3 billion. Our trend has been to decrease our investment in bonds and increase our investment in strategic government projects such as the oil project in Panacocha, in which we invested $135 million. Another is a thermoelectric project that will help to produce electric power in the drought season so we won't suffer any more blackouts; we have invested $130 million in that project. There is also the hydroelectric project at Toachi-Pilaton, which will demand an investment of $250 million, of which we have already disbursed $100 million.</p><div class="quote">“The last 12 months have been very positive; we have not only achieved all of our planned goals, but surpassed them."</div><h4>What is your investment plan for 2012?</h4><p>We plan to continue growing our mortgage loan portfolio, but not at the 45% growth rate we saw in 2011. In 2012 we plan to grant $900 million in mortgage loans; in 2011 we granted $750 million. The other important item is consumer credit; we plan to allocate $1 billion in 2012. We also have a very small portfolio of pledge loans having to do with jewelry and gold items, which is a service we provide for the entire community. I actually see it as a social responsibility issue, because we attend to people that are not necessarily affiliated with social security but who require emergency loans of small amounts, $400 on average. They come and leave their jewelry, and they receive a six-month loan at a 20% annual interest rate, which is lower than the ones usually found in this type of businesses. We also plan to invest $300 million in the stock market in 2012.</p><h4>What has your non-performing loan (NPL) rate been?</h4><p>In order to answer that, I first need to explain how the bank operates, because if I were to tell you, you wouldn't believe me. Our rate of delinquency is zero. We have granted 42,000 mortgage loans and of those, we have only had problems with nine. Of those, eight have found solutions; there has only been one mortgagee who said, “Keep the house." Why does this happen? First, the defaulters have been unemployed, because as long as our clients have a job the payments of the loan are deducted directly from their paychecks. This is an advantage that no other bank offers. For our consumer loans the delinquency rate is also zero, because if a client doesn't pay for three months we take the payment out of their reserve funds or severance funds. This is the way all our loans work.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main aspects and projects coordinated by your Ministry to change the energy matrix?</h4><p>The vision by 2016 is that 93% of energy sources in the matrix will be hydroelectric. This is a small country where there is petroleum, nevertheless we bet on renewable energies and not only for the sovereignty of Ecuador in renewable energy, but also to be able to export energy. In 2010, Ecuador held the pro-tempore presidency of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), and we proposed taking advantage of our hydroelectric potential to export renewable electric energy to the region, not only to Colombia and Peru, but also to Venezuela, Chile, and Uruguay. We also promoted at the Andean Community level a transversal regulation that is valid for Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. We now have eight new hydroelectric power plants under construction. We have also consolidated our thermal park through our energy sovereignty, to improve the reliability of the service. Our energy reserves have increased considerably and we have substituted a lot of the generating capacity that used diesel to fuel oil, a product available in Ecuador. The goal by 2013 is for Ecuador to consume no diesel in the electric sector. In 2012 it will already represent less than 1%, because we have been substituting it for fuel oil and natural gas. In the future, the country will have a strong hydroelectric component. By 2016 we will double the installed capacity of electric generation across the whole territory.</p><h4>What has been the Ministry's role in the recent changes to the telecommunications sector in the country?</h4><p>In 2006 the previous government tried to conclude a contract with mobile telecommunications operators. The vision was to get $70 million for the licenses. We negotiated with the operators for $700 million plus 1% of the raw revenues for the IT development fund. Everyone thought that rates were going to increase, that the networks were not going to be developed, that service penetration wouldn't increase, and that traffic was going to reduce, but at the end of the day the situation was the opposite. Rates actually decreased, companies pay corporate taxes, coverage increased, penetration grew exponentially, and the state will get $700 million over the next 15 years. Also, investment over the next five years will be around $900 million through the public company to improve services. Before, we had 1,400 kilometers of fiber-optic cable under the public company, and now we have almost 7,500 kilometers, while broadband prices have decreased. Public companies have managed to reduce the costs of the entire industry. For the first time in history, our 23 provinces are connected through fiber-optic cables. Before, this public policy didn't exist. Despite this situation, the profits of the public companies have increased. Almost 4,000 schools are also connected to the internet through the Scholar Connectivity Plan.</p><div class="quote">“The vision by 2016 is that 93% of energy sources in the matrix will be hydroelectric."</div><h4>Currently the country is looking at the mining sector as the engine for the next economic boom. Is this a real possibility?</h4><p>We are finalizing negotiations for contracts with two private mining companies. One is EcuaCorriente (copper) and the other is Kinross (gold). Foreign investment by mining companies will be at least $1.5 billion over the development periods, and I am sure that when the negotiations are done Ecuador will receive a significant amount of mining income. After that, we are planning to launch a bid for the exploration of new areas. The constitution obliges us to keep at least 50% of mining income for the state, with a tremendous respect for nature. These resources will be invested by the government in infrastructure and in development projects in nearby towns. This is a new issue in Ecuador; we are at the beginning, but now there is a clear legal framework. The takeoff of mining in the country is going to be very important.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan has made impressive progress in economic development. Against a backdrop of new economic challenges and the ongoing global crisis, what action does the state intend to take to fully realize its full potential?</h4><p>In order to achieve all we have, we have worked to diversify the economy, stimulate the production of innovative components, and support export-oriented industries and the development of SMEs. In 2011, the GDP growth rate was the highest in the last three years at 7.5%. Given the instability of the global economy, measures to prevent a recession in the economy include maintaining employment levels, providing social assistance to citizens of different categories, as well as ensuring financial stability. In addition, wisely using natural resources has allowed the accumulation of substantial financial capacity in the specially created National Foundation. To date, the international reserves of the National Bank, with assets from the National Fund, total more than $80.5 billion. With the establishment of “threshold" values, the dynamics of key macroeconomic indicators are systematically monitored on a constant basis. Additional incentives and support measures will be introduced should the economy enter into a risky zone. To reach our goals, we need to ensure annual economic growth of at least 7%.</p><h4>Large-scale projects in the processing of raw materials and infrastructure development have been launched in Kazakhstan. What is the significance of such developments?</h4><p>Indeed, in this year's State of the Union Address, I gave instructions on the implementation of a number of large industrial and infrastructure projects such as the construction of a gas and chemical complex in the Atyrau region, and an integrated refining complex in the Atyrau oil refinery for the production of complex fertilizers. Other large-scale projects that will be built comprise the West-North-Center gas pipeline, the Balkhash thermal power plant, the Beineu-Zhezkazgan and Arkalyk-Shubarkol railroads, and the 2,800-kilometer-long Kazakhstani section of the international Western Europe-Western China transit corridor. The total project cost will amount to KZT4.3 trillion, or about $29 billion, about $9 billion of which will be financed by the state. Funds allocated to the national welfare fund Samruk-Kazyna for the anti-crisis program of 2009-2010 will be re-allocated to this end. All of these global initiatives are aimed at addressing the key objectives of Kazakhstan's economy; a self-sustaining, independent domestic market of oil products and mineral fertilizers, the gasification of the northern regions, the enhanced energy supply of the southern regions, and the formation of transport arteries and international transit routes. In addition, the implementation of projects should provide a significant multiplier effect for the major regions of the country. These projects should stimulate the development of SMEs and new technologies. This is the basic idea of the industrial policy; the state sets the initial momentum, and the task of the private sector is to pick up and develop the initial initiative. For example, the construction of a gas processing facility for the production of polypropylene and polyethylene will not only diversify Kazakhstani exports, but also create conditions for the formation of a number of new high-tech chemical industries in Kazakhstan. The Western Europe-Western China transit corridor involves around 100 contractors, 30 asphalt producers, and 24 cement/concrete plants. The project involves over 35,000 employees. Since the beginning of the project, 21 production facilities were either built or modernized, including two cement factories in the cities of Taraz and Shymkent, a plant for the production of dowels for cement-asphalt coatings in Almaty, the upgrading of two bitumen plants in Kyzylorda and Shymkent, and factories for paint and geosynthetic materials production in Almaty. I would also like to note that the program of industrialization is not limited to the projects I have mentioned. During the 2010-2011 period, 389 projects worth around $12 billion have been implemented, which has created 43,000 permanent jobs. The implemented projects create an economic value of $3.4 billion annually. Now, in the framework of Kazakhstan's industrialization map, 220 projects are being implemented in a wide spectrum of industries including refining, agriculture, metallurgy, chemicals, engineering, construction, pharmaceuticals, and aerospace. The total cost of the projects is about $53 billion and provides for the creation of about 300,000 jobs.</p><div class="quote">“Our country has taken a worthy place in modern geopolitics, following a multi-level and multi-dimensional foreign policy."</div><h4>The Foreign Investors Council has become an effective platform for strengthening dialogue between foreign businessmen and the government in recent years. What benefits does such close dialogue bring to the development of the business climate in the country?</h4><p>The Foreign Investors Council was established in 1998 to provide for direct dialogue with investors operating in Kazakhstan, as well as operational solutions for issues concerning investment activities. One of the main functions of the council is to make recommendations on key areas of investment policy, as well as to improve the investment climate and regulatory framework. At present, the council includes 29 leading foreign companies and international organizations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Deutsche Bank, Arcelor Mittal, HSBC, General Electric, Sberbank, Total, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and others. Since its inception the council has held 24 meetings, in which a wide range of topics were discussed. The key issues include improving the tax system and tax administration, the modernization of Kazakhstan's economy, Kazakhstan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), progress in improving transparency and fighting corruption, the involvement of foreign investors in the policy of diversification, and technological development in Kazakhstan. In light of the opinions of members of the council, I have given appropriate instructions to the government, which are going to be implemented before the next council meeting. In order to detail the recommendations of the Foreign Investors Council, working groups constantly look at issues of taxation, legislation, the current activities of foreign investors, and the improvement of the investment image of Kazakhstan, as well as the oil and gas sector. Ultimately, much of the council's recommendations are reflected in policy documents that result in concrete results, such as the state program for accelerated industrial-innovative development over the 2010-2014 period, the program to attract investment, the development of special economic zones, and export promotion for the 2010-2014 period. Thanks to this policy to improve the investment climate, the total amount of FDI in Kazakhstan grew from $2.78 billion in 2000 to $19.85 billion in 2011. From only 2008 to 2011, Kazakhstan went from 64th to 47th place in the World Bank's Doing Business report. In the Protecting Investors category, Kazakhstan ranked 10th. In May 2012 the council held the 25th meeting on the theme of “Kazakhstan; an international trade, logistics, business, and financial hub." We are always open to fruitful discussions and the valuable advice of the council members, who will be able to give an additional boost to the economy. Overall, I would like to commend the contribution of the Foreign Investors Council in improving the business and investment climate in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>During the second summit on nuclear security in Seoul, you mentioned Kazakhstan's plans to build an international bank for low-enriched uranium in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). How important is this project for Kazakhstan and for global security in general?</h4><p>The international bank for low-enriched uranium under the auspices of the IAEA is to be created on the initiative and financial support of the non-profit Nuclear Threat Initiative, as well as the US, EU, Norway, the UAE, and Kuwait. In 2009, Kazakhstan proposed hosting the bank on its territory and last year submitted a formal application to the IAEA. At present, the project is entering the implementation stage. The bank aims to ensure the effective functioning of the international nuclear fuel market. States that comply with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and are developing a national nuclear energy sector should be confident that they will receive nuclear fuel in a guaranteed and predictable manner. The establishment of the nuclear fuel reserve under the auspices of the IAEA is intended to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and demonstrate the consistency and feasibility of international initiatives in this area. Proposing to host a fuel bank in its territory, we hereby reaffirm that Kazakhstan is an active supporter of the non-proliferation regime, and a leader in strengthening global security.</p><h4>Kazakhstan is a champion of multi-vector diplomacy in its foreign relations. In which direction will the nation's foreign policy develop in the coming years?</h4><p>Kazakhstan's foreign policy is predetermined by the realities of the world, including features unique to the geographic position of our country. Therefore, our country has taken a worthy place in modern geopolitics, following a multi-level and multi-dimensional foreign policy. We will continue with our balanced foreign policy, interacting not only with the West, but also with Asian countries. Today, regional processes are increasingly setting the global agenda. The nature and dynamics of the integration process will depend on the future of the world. Our foreign policy will remain the same; integration in the region, followed by access to global integration with the global community. We intend to continue to lead in our global initiatives. Today, it is important for the whole world and every state to find answers to powerful global and regional challenges. Thanks to peaceful foreign policy, international initiatives, strict adherence to obligations, and participation in regional and world affairs, we have earned the trust and respect of our foreign partners. Kazakhstan's foreign policy proposals were supported by the international community on both global and regional levels. Our challenge is to implement these proposals, and realize a number of international events of global and regional importance. Kazakhstan will continue to identify ways to strengthen peace and international security, and encourage the disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Contributing to the addressing of global and regional economic security, at the 5th Astana Economic Forum, held in May 2012, Kazakhstan presented its idea to create an initiative called G-Global to discuss ways of overcoming the global crisis. We will also strive to implement Kazakhstan's global energy strategy, as well as initiatives such as the Astana "Green Bridge," aimed at the transfer of green technologies. The Fourth Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, which has become an important platform for international inter-religious dialogue, was held in Astana in May 2012. By holding the congress, Kazakhstan contributed to the union of spiritual and moral potential of religious teachings in resolving international conflicts and combating modern threats. As an active member of the UN and other international and regional organizations, our country is becoming the center of focus for the regional offices of international organizations. In this regard, Kazakhstan is expected to form an international hub for multilateral diplomacy in Almaty. The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA). This year marks 20 years of my initiative of convening the CICA, which is considered today by the international community as a unique inter-governmental platform for dialogue and consultation, decision-making, and action by consensus on security issues in Asia. The inclusion of the CICA in working groups under the auspices of the UN and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is evidence of the importance of this forum in the world. Kazakhstan will work on the implementation of multilateral decisions taken during its recently concluded presidency of prestigious organizations such as the OSCE and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Interesting projects are expected to be realized within the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States. In particular, Astana was proclaimed 2012's culture capital of the Turkic world and the CIS. This year, we have to adequately complete the chairmanship of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In the future, the implementation of our initiatives, which have received the support of the OIC, will take place. Our country intends to continue its efforts to promote cooperation within the CSTO, and build its capacity in order to ensure peace and stability in the region. Responding to the global challenges of the 21st century, to deepen Eurasian integration, we, along with Russia and Belarus, formed a single economic space, which will proceed to the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union. This is an important step to regional stability overall and improving the competitiveness of our economies. We are ready to support the desire of other CIS states to join this Eurasian integration. Attention will also be given to the implementation of a CIS development concept. This document defines the priority directions of cooperation for the long term and is intended to revitalize the CIS. However, it should be clear that while transitioning into the Eurasian Economic Union, Kazakhstan's foreign policy, as it always has, will continue to develop balanced relations with other countries and regions.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of 2011?</h4><p>On a global basis, 2011 was a fantastic success. We experienced the best results in the company's near 40-year history, and it was the same story for our operations in Kazakhstan. The CIS region as a whole grew very quickly, and in Kazakhstan we experienced growth at faster multiples than that of other markets in the region. We have been confident in terms of the market Kazakhstan has to offer based on the fundamental economic structure of the economy and its correlation to SAP market dominance in many industries. During 2011, we expanded our footprint within the subsoil sector, made significant progress in the public sector, and formulated a structured and pragmatic program to address the SME sector, which has started to gain momentum. As we look forward to 2012 and beyond, we are excited about the prospect of promoting the new innovations in the sphere of real time (in memory) analytics and especially our mobile solutions and cloud offerings, which will complement and further enhance the value our clients can leverage from SAP innovations. Overall, we are very satisfied with our 2011 performance and remain confident and committed to our strategy to enable Kazakhstan to “Run Better."</p><h4>What strategies have you followed to achieve such a successful year?</h4><p>In order to realize the ambitions that we have set forth in our growth plan, we have invested significantly in both increasing the market awareness as to the tangible business value of SAP technologies, as well as developing the professional skills, certification, and volume of the consulting partners that we have within our local ecosystem. These measures are essential not only to project success and value realization for our clients, but also to form sustainable local content and employment opportunities in the local IT sector. In Kazakhstan, our strategy is to engage with our clients strategically, meaning that we seek to form long-term partnerships with clear and measurable objectives. We aim to be involved in formulating modernization plans in line with client and state objectives, such as the Productivity 2020 program, the People's IPO, and the topic of financial and operational governance. All of these elements are starting to come together: the local content, the investment, and the value realization programs. When we have forward-looking visibility, it gives us the opportunity to maintain or even increase our investment program in the region. The year 2011 marked the success of a good strategy that was launched several years ago.</p><div class="quote">“We aim to be involved in formulating modernization plans in line with client and state objectives."</div><h4>How do you see the demand for SAP consultants developing?</h4><p>In a word: significantly. As a rough rule of thumb, for every dollar invested in software, there is a ratio of investment required for implementation, ranging from 1:2 to 1:3. Kazakhstan is our regional hub in Central Asia, which includes Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. More than 90% of our business currently comes from Kazakhstan, which enjoys the political drive, expanding innovation, and a large amount of foreign investment; this cannot yet be said for the surrounding Central Asian states. However, if we acknowledge the vast resource wealth of Central Asia (outside of Kazakhstan) and take a mid-term perspective, we anticipate that the surrounding regions will need to adopt SAP technology to tackle the same challenges that Kazakhstan has been addressing in recent years. This, coupled with the maturing demand in the Russian and Belarus regions, provides the basis for Kazakhstan to become a net exporter of IT consulting services and intellectual property (IP) in the medium to long term. The CIS market will reach a value of $2.5 billion-$3 billion by 2015, and will continue to grow; the question is where the human capital will come from and to what extend Kazakhstani businesses will catch the wave.</p><h4>How does SAP benefit the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>SAPs Global Mission Statement is to “Make the World Run Better." As 63% of the world's GDP touches an SAP system, this is not as far fetched a statement as it may at first appear. In Kazakhstan, we are able to introduce benefits in the short term, such as increasing the operational efficiency of a company and enabling the governance models that increase the confidence of both national and international investment communities. Within the region there is a lot of work to do to modernize via the adoption of global best practices, and thus the need to develop the local “knowledge economy." As an indication of our long-term commitment to the region, in 2011, the SAP board approved a project to translate our core product range into the Kazakh language to support the state in its initiative to retain the nation's cultural heritage. The project is enormous; there are more than 30,000 terms, words, and phrases that are used in IT systems today, and many of those words do not exist in the language. Kazakh is an old language, and this project will help drive its evolution. To complete the project is a multimillion-dollar investment spanning more than two years. Does the market today justify that investment? It's questionable, but we believe that the market in the future will benefit from this.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does ArcelorMittal's experience in Temirtau reflect Kazakhstan's economic progress in the past two decades?</h4><p>ArcelorMittal moved into Kazakhstan in 1995 when we took over the steel plant in Temirtau and coal mines in the Karaganda region. We have seen a lot of progress ever since we came to this market, particularly in terms of industrial development in this region. There are several reasons behind this marked improvement. First of all, this country is blessed with lots of natural resources, particularly minerals, and the government is headed in the right direction to add value to these products and make it economically viable and sustainable in the long term. We have also invested quite a lot in our operations and benefited from the growth in this part of the world. In 1995, we were not a 4-million-ton company, as we are today. In all three of our focus operations, which are mining, steel making, and transforming steel into value-added end products, we are making a significant contributions to the country's progress.</p><h4>ArcelorMittal experienced increased steel production in 1H2011. To what extent is this due to post-crisis recovery, and to what extent do you see new demand?</h4><p>This increase is partially due to new demand in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan was one of the countries that anticipated the 2008 crisis. In 2007, we experienced financial issues and this government took some well-calculated measures. Due to these prudent policies, it was one of the first countries to emerge from the crisis. We still feel the positive impact of those decisions, which translate into a relatively stronger economic performance compared to other countries in the region. We are expecting GDP growth of around 7%, which is a high number. Therefore, fundamentally, growth has come to some extent from Kazakhstan. However, the per capita consumption rate for steel is low in this country, and thus a certain level of growth must also have come from the CIS region.</p><div class="quote">“As far as improvement is concerned, health and safety is one angle. The second is the augmentation of production."</div><h4>How do you to strike a balance between the installation of new production lines and the modernization of existing infrastructure?</h4><p>We need new installations for growth, as customer requirements change. Additionally, we invest to improve efficiency and reduce costs. With respect to new products, we are launching long products. This mill has traditionally produced flat products. However, our investments are not limited to quantifiable indicators such as production volumes and efficiency. First and foremost, we have invested in health and safety, which is the prime focus for the company. As far as improvement is concerned, health and safety is one angle. The second is the augmentation of production. The third level is improving the existing product portfolio. As far as improving the quality is concerned, we have also invested in high value-added product lines and services. Lastly, distribution is an area in which we are investing. One other area that requires attention is ArcelorMittal's prioritized efforts to comply with Kazakhstan's environmental laws. In 2011, we completed the reconstruction of blast furnace 2 with state-of-the-art de-dusting and gas-cleaning equipment, installed electric dust filters at blast furnace 4, and launched a closed-circuit cooling system for coke gas. In 2012 we are working on the reconstruction of the gas cleaning system at the converters shop, which will eliminate a large portion of the plant's air emissions. Our coal mines are also improving their environmental performance. For example, in early 2012 we launched a 1.4 MW power generator, which uses coal bed methane as fuel. Methane is also used as fuel for boilers to produce heat during the winter season.</p><h4>What are some highlights from the company's advancements in health and safety standards?</h4><p>Health and safety is the top priority for the company. We are working on changing the mindsets of our people about health and safety. Ever since we started looking at the safety standards in developed countries, we have used them as our benchmark for ArcelorMittal Group and for our operations in Kazakhstan. We have brought down the frequency of fatalities and incidents over the years by focusing on individuals to ensure that they work in safe conditions. We have seen continuous improvement in the health and safety over the past years and in 2011 our steel and mining operations achieved a time-injury frequency rate of below 1, a historic low for Kazakhstan's operations. There is still a long way to go, but fundamentally we are on the right track. For us it is not about the amount of money spent, but about raising awareness and changing the mindsets of employees to get across the message that their health and safety is important.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define Efes Kazakhstan's current strengths?</h4><p>Efes Kazakhstan is one of the leading companies in the beverage industry, and is a very important player in the Kazakhstan market. In terms of reputation and brand recognition, the company has a very strong position. We entered the market in November 1997 via an initial investment in Karaganda. In our first year, we were ranked in fifth place in the beer market with a 10% market share and an annual production volume of 8 million liters. With the right investments and strategies, we increased our position to first place by September 2010. As of January 2012, Efes has an annual production capacity of more than 280 million liters and a 52% market share. We have 11 brands in our portfolio, including international brand names such as Bavaria and Amsterdam Navigator. We also have strong local brands, such as KruzhkaSvezhego, Karagandinskoe, and Tyan-Shan. Additionally, we produce Bely Medved, which was created in Russia and made international through our group. We set a goal for Efes Kazakhstan to become the most admired company in Kazakhstan by 2020. In line with this aim, we have heavily invested in the management of both our factories. At the same time we understand the responsibility that comes while operating in the alcoholic beverage sector, and therefore we carry out strong social responsibility programs to promote responsible drinking.</p><h4>Anadolu Group and SABMiller have formed an exclusive partnership. How would you characterize the prospects of such collaboration?</h4><p>In order to create synergies between the two companies and exchange knowledge, a strategic alliance between Anadolu Group and SABMiller was established. Through this alliance, SABMiller's beer operations in Russia and Ukraine, and sales rights in the CIS region and the Middle East, will be transferred to Efes in exchange for 24% of Efes' shares. Currently, SABMiller does not operate production facilities in Kazakhstan, and therefore the regional experience and presence of Efes in the domestic market will benefit both companies. We will soon incorporate leading SABMiller products such as Miller, Grolsch, Pilsner Urquell, ZolotayaBochka, and Kozel into our portfolio. Through its global strength, SABMiller offers to Efes a window on the entire world.</p><div class="quote">“We understand the responsibility that comes while operating in the alcoholic beverage sector."</div><h4>What comparisons can be made between the beer segments in Kazakhstan and Turkey, where Efes is originally from?</h4><p>In Turkey, there is no strong segmentation in the beer market. Customers are served Efes Pilsner at five-star hotels as well as at corner shops in low-income neighborhoods. In contrast, Kazakhstan has a very fragmented market, and each brand has its own market position. There are five segments: super premium, premium, upper mainstream, lower mainstream, and economy. We focus on the top four segments, and the Efes Pilsner brand belongs to the premium segment, which accounts for about 9% of the total market. Therefore, although Efes Pilsner is a very successful flagship brand in its own segment, it is not our main volume brand in Kazakhstan. On the other hand, the consumer base for hard liquor in Turkey—with the exception of rakı—is small and very specific. In Kazakhstan, the consumption rate of vodka is decreasing due to health concerns. This is a positive trend for beer, but it is also beneficial for consumers. Indeed, beer contains 100% natural products and its alcohol content is much lower than strong spirits by volume.</p><h4>How do you assess the tax regulations concerning beer in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>In many countries, beer is not considered an alcoholic beverage; however, in Kazakhstan this is not the case. Beer is defined as an alcoholic beverage, and all legislative limitations concerning alcohol apply to beer as well. And if we look at the taxation of drinks with different levels of alcohol content, the excise tax for beer is higher than that for vodka per liter.</p><h4>How does Eurasian economic integration affect the beer market in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>After the establishment of the Customs Union in 2011, certain issues are being handled on a supranational level. Currently, negotiations concerning many topics are in progress, in addition to decisions related to the beer market of Kazakhstan and the Customs Union as a whole. The Union of Beer Producers, of which I am the President, is making efforts to change the status of beer and establish its differentiation from strong spirits. While the Customs Union made it easier to trade among the member states, it made it more complicated to export to other countries. In fact, 100% of our exports are destined for Kyrgyzstan. The remaining CIS markets are handled by Anadolu Efes' headquarters in Turkey. With the establishment of a permanent and healthy Customs Union, we are expecting expansion to our neighboring countries and increased benefits for all parties. I see growth potential and believe that it will be good for Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What export opportunities does this integration provide Kazakhstani brewers?</h4><p>As the Russian market has a capacity surplus and logistics expenses are high, Russia is not a potential export market for our beer. Moreover, Efes already has a very strong market presence in Russia, with a portfolio very similar to that of Kazakhstan. Should we observe a capacity shortage in Kazakhstan or in Russia, the Customs Union can be an opportunity for Efes to make more efficient use of our capacity in both operations.</p><h4>How do you see the year 2012 shaping up?</h4><p>Our goal is to continue on the path of sustainable and healthy growth. While the sector is projected to grow in single-digit terms in 2012, we intend to reach growth higher rates and increase our market share. At the end of 2011, the global macroeconomic outlook was not entirely optimistic. However, with the latest developments and new measures in place to resolve the European debt crisis, we have a more positive view of 2012.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) been developing its strategy in recent years?</h4><p>The strategy we prepared will allow us to separate service providers from the regulator. After having several meetings with all stakeholders, this strategy was prepared and approved by the Executive Office. We are planning to go through with this policy, which defines the expansion of facilities and infrastructure to meet the projected growth in the Emirate of Dubai. It has been designed to ensure the hub status of Dubai and to make Dubai the aviation capital of the world. Emirates Airlines is purchasing a larger number of “superjumbo" A380s, and we are building Concourse 3 and 4 to accommodate these aircraft. Dubai Airport will reach a capacity of 90 million by 2018. Al Maktoum Airport, with five runways, is being built to accommodate us to operate from both airports giving us a capacity of 160 million passengers an year.</p><h4>What factors have led to the successful rapid evolution of Dubai as an international transit and travel hub?</h4><p>Since the beginning, Dubai Airport has applied an open-skies policy. The main obstacle was in persuading other states to adopt it. Many airports in the Gulf are now applying this policy and we have agreements with almost all of Europe. We have something even more with the US; the “seventh freedom" has allowed cargo carriers to fly without returning to their point of origin. This means companies can do business and travel on. This is very good for cargo carriers like FedEx and DHL. They are both coming to Dubai without going back to the US. National carriers can do the same when flying to US. We have an open-skies policy with almost all of the Pacific and Asian civil aviation groups and agreements with nearly two-thirds of the countries in Africa. Every country is working to implement policies such as ours. In order to build businesses an open-skies system should be embraced. By the year 2018 we aim to handle 90 million passengers. That is when we will have to move to Al Maktoum Airport. Currently, we handle over 50 million passengers per year, and by the end of 2012 we expect 56 million people to pass through our airport. Looking at the statistics, we are fourth in the world in terms of carrying international passengers. Some of the largest airports are very heavy in handling international passengers; we, on the other hand, handle international passengers exclusively. Our contribution to Dubai's GDP is 28%, creating 250,000 jobs. By the year 2020, the aviation sector is expected to create 375,000 jobs directly and indirectly, contributing 32% of GDP.</p><div class="quote">“The leaders here are very flexible, and they always give people a chance; anyone who fails has only himself to blame."</div><h4>What is the next step in terms of expanding the Emirate's reach to different destinations?</h4><p>We already have connections from East to West and North to South and currently our reach extends to over 200 destinations with almost 160 aircraft, growing by two planes per month. The major players are Emirates and flydubai, and through them we have connections to and from almost every city and country in the world. We offer 18 flights per day to the UK, excluding services provided by British Airways. We also have 85 flights per week to Australia. Every two or three months we open up two new destinations in response to growing demand. Emirates Airlines has been expanding very rapidly and the team operating the company is very dynamic. In Dubai, it is your responsibility to succeed. The leaders here are very flexible, and they always give people a chance; anyone who fails has only himself to blame.</p><h4>Why was the role of the DCAA realigned to remove responsibility for managing the airport?</h4><p>As a government establishment, we had no limited liability. The DCAA was obliged to handle and deal with these issues. We felt there should be an agreement with a different party to secure a limited liability “just in case." We are part of the government and the system was presenting a conflict of interest between being a service provider and a regulator. Moreover, European and US airlines did not appreciate that system. Previously, I felt I was wearing two hats; one was running the airport and the other was monitoring the regulatory side. Now I am not involved in the operations side or service providers' work. Instead, we are now a regulatory authority making sure everything is operating in compliance with international standards, which is working smoothly. We have also been entrusted with the task of formulating a strategy, which was drafted in collaboration with other companies and organizations such as flydubai, Emirates, duty-free zones, customs, immigration, Dubai Airports, and the police. Everyone is a partner and a stakeholder and the strategy has now been approved. We hope that by 2020 Dubai will be the number one aviation capital of the world—second place is not acceptable.</p><h4>What are the main challenges you face for the further development of the industry?</h4><p>The challenge that lies in front of us is in air space design, where we face many internal and external obstacles. Congestion in airspace is the biggest threat to our growth. The DCAA is working to overcome these challenges through discussions with the other emirates. The internal problems are simply technical issues that need to be addressed. The DCAA has in place a committee to look into this. We also maintain very good relations with the other emirates. The external issues may take a little more time as it they need to be resolved at the federal UAE level. However, working together is the only way forward to solve this issue. We are optimistic that we can attain a European-style control that will function in the Gulf and Middle East. We hope that in the near future we will be able to unify our airspace, which is very important as we seek to evolve.</p><h4>How have you continued to attract airlines to Dubai?</h4><p>We may be the first airport in the world that responds to a request for landing and operations within half an hour, while other airports take a month or two. According to bilateral agreements, we are required to reply within 60 days. However, we need only 30 minutes to scrutinize the required aircraft documents and to approve a request. We work 24 hours a day to serve our customers. This is very helpful and airlines have no excuse not to come to Dubai. This has been a standard operation since I joined in 1966.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mexico's experience been during the process of trade liberalization in recent years?</h4><p>Mexico is totally convinced about the benefits of free trade. Although trade liberalization had its criticisms at first, nowadays most countries agree that having an open economy is an opportunity to expand markets for their enterprises and, of course, to create better jobs for nationals. Nowadays, Mexico has 12 free trade agreements (FTAs) involving 44 countries. Such agreements have allowed Mexico not only to increase its exports to all those countries, hence creating new business opportunities for companies established in Mexico, but also to obtain quality inputs for its productive activities at much more competitive prices. Why? Because through trade openness, national economies can focus their production on those goods and services in which they have competitive advantages, so world production becomes more efficient. Since advantages go both ways, free trade is a win-win game for all. In other words, free trade is definitely one of the most effective engines to promote both efficiency and economic development.</p><h4>So, you are saying that “globalization" and open markets are in fact good for those countries committed to efficiency?</h4><p>Absolutely. The fact of the matter is that globalization has integrated societies, countries, and economies through different channels, such as trade, FDI, technology transfer, and knowledge flows, hence bringing about important benefits at a global level such as the expansion of production capacity, employment, human capital enhancement, innovation, and technology diffusion, all of which support growth in overall incomes. Now, one important result of this process of globalization is that it has increased the international fragmentation of production and the rise of trade in intermediate products. For example, in the manufacturing of an automobile, there are at least 50 different countries involved in the supply chain of the various parts, components, and services required for its production. Therefore, thanks to globalization, each day more countries have better opportunities to participate in at least one part of the global production process. But the important point is that, over the last few decades, there is evidence that countries with open markets are precisely those that have been able to focus their production efforts on those activities in which they are relatively more efficient. The reduction in transport costs and the rapid evolution of information technology have indeed made it easier to segment production across a range of countries. In that way, countries with open economies have taken advantage of their specializations in order to develop more competitive production processes, to increase productivity, and to pay better salaries, all of which strengthen their internal markets. At the same time, those countries have benefited from higher efficiency in the economies with which they trade, thereby lowering their input and production costs. We are convinced that free trade is one of the most important tools to take advantage of the globalization process. It is important to mention that the global value of foreign trade transactions made by all those countries with which we have a trade agreement represents today around three-fifths of the world's GDP. Indeed, thanks to the opening up of our economy in the mid-1980s, Mexico began to experience substantial gains in the competitiveness of its exports. Why? Because our producers began to have access to a better range of production inputs, and those were available at a significantly lower price. Our national products became more competitive and our production processes are more efficient every day. We will keep doing the task correctly to continue getting benefits for everyone. For instance, during 2011, according to the competitiveness index of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Mexico scaled up as much as eight positions, more than any other country on the continent. Moreover, according to the World Bank's Doing Business Report, the Mexican economy has consistently done better than any of the BRIC economies. Thanks to the competitive gains Mexico has made since its opening-up of trade policy, foreign trade now represents around 60% of Mexico's GDP, a huge increase from the 25% GDP share observed at the beginning of the 1990s. Also, FDI now amounts to $18.5 billion, six times more than the observed amount two decades ago. In this context, let me give you an example of how the Secretariat of Economy is working to promote efficiency and foreign investment in Mexico. One of the main roles of the Secretariat of  Economy is to ease and simplify foreign trade operations in order to increase the efficiency in the international exchange process and to promote the competitiveness of export and import companies. One important complementary tool to achieve these goals is the Manufacturing, and Export Services Industries Program (IMMEX). Thanks to Mexico's FTAs, today nearly 6,800 enterprises are registered with IMMEX, hence creating business opportunities, increasing investment flows, and generating better-paid jobs. In a few words, with the proper tools, globalization and free trade encourage productivity, innovation, and competitiveness, thereby boosting entrepreneurship.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico has 12 free trade agreements involving 44 countries."</div><h4>So far, you have talked about many benefits for producers and entrepreneurs in Mexico, but what about Mexican workers and consumers?</h4><p>Critics of it usually counter-argue that foreign trade causes business closures and layoffs, but that is definitely not true. On the one hand, the huge increase in Mexico's foreign trade has generated more jobs and better salaries for workers. Indeed, one out of every five jobs in Mexico is provided either by exporting enterprises or by firms that receive FDI. On the other hand, Mexican residents and foreign visitors now have access to a much more extensive range of goods and services, and they can buy those goods at a much better price. And the main reason for such a result is that those goods are now produced more efficiently worldwide, so consumers have a wider choice. Mexico will keep supporting all measures that ease foreign trade and help our country and Latin America be a more competitive region. In conclusion, free trade generates winners everywhere, and it is one of the keys to promoting world economic growth and to strengthen the integration of regional markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed since privatization in 2005?</h4><p>When Türk Telekom was privatized at the end of 2005, its main business was fixed line, and it had a 40% share in the smallest mobile operator in the market. Putting forward a convergence strategy and taking the necessary steps transformed Türk Telekom into the group of companies it is today. This transformation spanned from revisions to its business model to the repositioning of its products and services utilizing a customer-focused approach; from its human resources investments—accelerated in parallel with technology and infrastructure upgrades—to an international growth route supported by its group structure abroad. Türk Telekom offers not only landline, but also mobile phone, data, and internet, as well as value-added services. The innovative technologies and services that complement fixed line, mobile, and internet are developed by Türk Telekom and its subsidiaries, which are technology companies acquired with a convergent technology focus. This strategy makes convergence not only a combination of voice, data, and video, but also IT services. Türk Telekom is well positioned to sustain this momentum and continue to build on its recent growth in 2011. We will continue to improve our services to the market, capitalizing on our advanced distribution channels, strong brand name, converged products, teamwork, and synergies. As a sign of customers' perception of all these products and services, Türk Telekom was ranked Turkey's most valuable brand by the international brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance for three years in row in 2009, 2010, and 2011.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the Turkish ICT sector and how is Türk Telekom capitalizing on them?</h4><p>We see the future in convergence technologies that facilitate people's lives, support social developments, and make contributions to the quality of life. This is also the fundamental reason to concentrate on convergence technologies and undertake leadership in this field. With convergence in mind, we are focusing on various communications services like voice, data, and video transmissions via a single platform and are providing fully integrated products and services that produce value for our customers. Convergence does not only mean a converged network for fixed and mobile, but it is about the convergence of services such as education and entertainment. We aim to offer value-added products and services for all people in the most advantageous and affordable ways, and we think this is the main challenge for the telecommunications sector. In addition, content and value-added services are the other engines affecting broadband growth. In this regard, we set our plan for convergence two years ago and positioned it as the central theme of our investments. We believe converged bundles including fixed voice, mobile voice, broadband, and other services will make Türk Telekom stronger and more efficient. We have supported this process with substantial investment, from which we have already started to see the benefits, such as developing value-creating technology products and exporting them to other countries.</p><div class="quote">“R&amp;D is one of the most important growth centers in our transformation process."</div><h4>What role will Türk Telekom play in achieving the government's 2023 vision for broadband internet penetration?</h4><p>Turkey's unique geographic location allows us to cover a vast area from Europe to the Middle East, and become a bridge and communications center. In 2010, we began to take advantage this opportunity with the acquisition of Pantel, one of the foremost independent wholesale data and capacity providers in Central and Southeastern Europe, with its 27,000 kilometer-long fiber-optic network. Yet another important development for Türk Telekom and the country's telecommunications sector was the realization of the JADI LINK project, which aimed to establish a colossal integrated multi-pass, fiber-optic network encompassing the Middle East, Southern Europe, and the Far East. I firmly believe that Türk Telekom will become a much more active international player by 2023. Turkey is expected to continue with this success story by maintaining sustainable growth. The ICT sector will be one of the main driving forces behind this growth. We believe that telecommunications infrastructure and information technology are critical elements for Turkey's competitiveness. Türk Telekom is working very hard in all these areas. With our continuous investments in infrastructure we aim to expand Turkey's internet access and improve service quality. Türk Telekom has set down 2012 as the year in which it will provide brand new products and technologies to the market in the broadband sector. We have focused our energy and expertise to enable Turkey to possess modern communications infrastructure and fiber technology that will meet its future needs. With these significant investments in infrastructure and technology, we carefully monitor the increase of internet penetration per household in particular. We believe that the target of enabling more people to access the internet will make an important contribution on the way to becoming an information society. In order to increase internet penetration rates in Turkey even further, we aim to enrich our broadband services and introduce fiber-optic services to all our customers and internet service providers. The increase in the number of ADSL connections from around 1.5 million in 2005 to over 7 million today is an encouraging sign of our efforts.</p><h4>What portion of Türk Telekom's budget is spent on R&amp;D, and what is the scale of its research activities?</h4><p>R&amp;D is one of the most important growth centers in our transformation process. We need R&amp;D in order to be in a position to follow technology trends, but also to lead it. In line with our vision to export Turkish technology all over the world, we attribute great importance to our R&amp;D activities. We are undertaking our R&amp;D efforts both through Türk Telekom and its group companies, such as Argela, İnnova, Sebit, and Sobee. These group companies play a pivotal role in the development of Türk Telekom's technological power and the export of convergence technologies. To date, we have developed many new successful products and services both in Turkey and abroad thanks to our R&amp;D efforts. Examples of products that were developed internally include Vitamin, Sebit's online education product, which is used on three continents; TTNET's web TV service Tivibu; and the I Can Football game, which was developed by Sobee and is the first online football game that can be played by 22 players in real time. Wirofon, which combines a home phone and mobile phone, makes placing calls possible over the internet on a current home phone pricing plan, providing a significant price advantage—particularly for calls made from abroad. Calls may be placed from abroad to Turkey from any WiFi hotspot at domestic rates without the need for a GSM connection.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of DP World?</h4><p>Formally established in September 2005, DP World was the result of a merger between the Dubai Ports Authority and Dubai Ports International (DPI). The companies had begun expanding outside of the UAE, and also decided to purchase CSX World Terminals earlier in 2005. We built our portfolio further with the purchase of P&amp;O in 2006, and the company has continued to grow since then, becoming the third largest port operator in the world. We began operations in 1972, when Port Rashid was completed and just a few months after the UAE was established. Encouraged by the success of Port Rashid and the region's development potential, the late ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Rashid bin Said Al Maktoum, gave instructions for an even more ambitious project; the construction of the world's largest man-made harbor at Jebel Ali. It was completed in 1979, with the Jebel Ali Free Zone added in the following years. His visionary leadership and business acumen set the pace for Dubai's unprecedented economic development. It was a brilliant strategy to integrate trade, logistics, and industry. Today's Dubai is living, thriving proof of Sheikh Rashid's dream becoming reality, taken forward by another visionary, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Historically, ports have played a pivotal role in establishing and sustaining communities throughout the world, and DP World has supported the nation's growth as a gateway for the GCC, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The company is now playing a critical role in the economic development of the wider region and its 2 billion inhabitants.</p><h4>What factors led to the successful creation of this international hub in just a few decades?</h4><p>Maritime trade has been at the heart of Dubai for generations upon generations, and it was only natural that the Emirate focus its energies on this core strength, fuelled by the trust, support, and encouragement provided by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Both he and his father realized very early that Dubai could succeed by leveraging its geographical location at the crossroads of East-West trade and offering outstanding supply chain services that would ensure it became a hub. Focusing on customers and investing to ensure that their growing needs are met has driven our international expansion. To date, we are operating more than 60 marine terminals around the world with a global team of 30,000 personnel.</p><div class="quote">“Maritime trade has been at the heart of Dubai for generations upon generations."</div><h4>What is the focus of DP World's 11 new projects, and what do they represent for the future of the company?</h4><p>We invest in markets where we see the potential to contribute to economic growth. With an average concession of around 40 years, we invest for the long term. Around 75% of our business comes from emerging markets, which have proven resilient during the global recession. Currently, three-quarters of the cargo we handle originate from or is destined for the markets in which we operate, known as origin and destination (O&amp;D) cargo. We will continue to focus on these two areas in the future, investing in direct response to our customers' needs. In 2011, we saw volumes in the UAE region rise to 13 million TEUs. This means that utilization is extremely high at our flagship Jebel Ali Port, which has continued to deliver strong volume growth and handled 3.2 million TEUs in the first three months of 2012, 8.5% ahead of the same period last year. It was clear from listening to our customers that growth in demand would mean Jebel Ali would soon be under considerable capacity. It was this that led us to announce plans last year to add 1 million TEUs to Terminal 2 to take its capacity to 6 million TEUs, and to develop a new terminal, Terminal 3, at an investment of $850 million, with the capacity for 4 million TEUs. Together they will take Jebel Ali's total capacity to 19 million TEUs by 2014. The new Terminal 3 will be capable of receiving the next generation of mega container ships that can carry as many as 18,000 TEUs, support the continued growth of Dubai and the UAE, and enhance the country's status as the trading center of the Middle East. In addition, the Dubai Logistics Corridor, which opened in 2010, is a positive force for growth. It is one of the world's largest sea-land-air transit bridges, with integrated customs and security facilities. Al Maktoum International Airport is just 20 minutes away from Jebel Ali Port, providing the supply chain sector with one of the most efficient multimodal platforms anywhere. While we are adding significant capacity to Jebel Ali over the coming two years, building a new terminal in Brazil and expanding our capacity in China, we are also pushing ahead with London Gateway and the new Maaslvakte 2 terminal in the Netherlands. The new developments and major expansions will give us the flexibility to increase capacity to around 103 million TEUs by 2020, in line with market demand.</p><h4>How is the development of the London Gateway port project progressing? What makes this market attractive for DP World?</h4><p>London Gateway is progressing extremely well and will be open for business by 4Q2013, with an initial capacity of 1.6 million TEUs. Like all of our projects, we are investing for the long term. London Gateway is set to become Europe's largest logistics park, situated on London's doorstep and located at the heart of Europe's largest economic zone. It will benefit businesses in the UK immensely by allowing both importers and exporters to take advantage of a more cost effective and greener way to transport the nation's goods as well as saving hundreds of millions of pounds a year. The project has already created more than 600 jobs since January 2010, when major construction work started at the site. Additionally, it will create 1,000 additional new jobs in the UK; 700 in the construction sector and 300 at the port. Estimates predict that as many as 36,000 jobs will be created in the long term, injecting some £3.2 billion into the UK economy each year and making London Gateway the largest job creation project in the country's history.</p><h4>How key are strong security measures in DP World's daily operations?</h4><p>We regard security as a baseline service for our customers. The nature of our operations exposes us to various operational, health, safety, and security risks that can impact our people, our customers, and our business operations. To mitigate such risks, we have implemented stringent security, safety, and health measures, including rolling out the independently audited ISO 28000 security management standards throughout our network. Currently, 38 of our facilities are certified. We are the only global marine terminal operator to be invited to become a member of the US Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), and we have 15 terminals participating in the US Customs Container Security Initiative—the largest number among the other operators. We are also a Principal Partner in the US Integrated Container Scanning Pilot Projects. Furthermore, we adhere to European security measures.</p><h4>What does the repayment of DP World's existing $3 billion loan represent for the company's long-term strategic approach to capital allocation?</h4><p>We decided to repay our $3 billion revolving credit facility due by October 2012 six months early. The premature cancellation of our original facility concept and the establishment of a new facility is prudent capital management. The new facility allows us to draw down and pre-pay cash as needed, providing timely and flexible access to cash as we continue to invest in our global portfolio to deliver profitable growth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for DP World and the wider economy in 2012?</h4><p>In the first quarter of 2012, we witnessed a 9.5 % increase in gross volumes. Analysts' latest forecasts for growth across the industry are around 5.5% volume growth for the year. Historically, DP World has outperformed the industry as a whole.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX)?</h4><p>Established in 2005, the DGCX is the region's first derivatives exchange and the only one that allows participants to clear and settle transactions within the GCC region. The exchange has played a pioneering role in developing the regional market for derivatives, having been the first to introduce futures and options contracts in the precious metals, energy, and currency sectors. The DGCX launched the world's first rupee futures contract in June 2007 and enhanced the contract further in November 2008 to make it cash settled based on the US dollar reference rate published by the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai on the last day of trading. This was followed by the launch of an Indian rupee options contract in September, 2011—today the only exchange-traded Indian rupee options product offered in a market outside of India. In April 2012, the DGCX launched its latest contract, copper futures. Dubai is rightly acknowledged as a leading regional trading hub and is ideally located geographically. As with Dubai, the DGCX also acts as bridge between the trading markets of Europe and the Far East, contributing to the global trading cycle. With its geographical location midway between the regions, the DGCX offers extended trading hours to global traders.</p><h4>You have recently been appointed as CEO of the exchange. What is your incoming development strategy, and what challenges do you foresee?</h4><p>I am delighted to be the CEO of the DGCX in what is a very exciting time for the exchange. Our strategy, which has served us very well over the last seven years, remains the same; the DGCX will continue to differentiate itself, and it will continue to review its product portfolio to consider improvements to its existing contracts and explore the introduction of new contracts. In 2012, the DGCX will continue to seek to enhance its global reach by introducing new products that appeal to a wider customer base. The exchange plans to launch emerging market currency products targeted at niche customers in the Middle East and emerging market countries. Developing sharia-compliant products, starting with sharia-compliant exchange-traded funds (ETFs), is another one of our key strategic focuses in 2012. Economic expansion and increasing international trade has created the need for market players to hedge their risks from fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange values. With economic expansion, market players need better ways to mitigate the considerable financial and commodity risks they are exposed to. The DGCX has played a vital role in strengthening the UAE's financial system by providing hedging tools and mechanisms that allow market players to transfer and manage risk within a well-regulated environment. And I'm committed to ensuring that the DGCX's role in the UAE's economic growth continues.</p><div class="quote">“The DGCX is the region's first derivatives exchange."</div><h4>How can sophisticated investors from both the Middle East and elsewhere gain commodities exposure in the local market in Dubai? What is unique about what the DGCX offers in the region?</h4><p>One of the DGCX's key differentiators is its product portfolio, which covers a diverse range of energy, precious metals, base metals, and currencies. These include the world's first Indian rupee and steel rebar futures contracts, as well as the first WTI and Brent Oil Futures contracts in the Middle East region. The DGCX's commitment to innovation and the pioneering of new products, working closely with its members, is also a competitive advantage, allowing the exchange to uniquely introduce new contracts that are required by clients in the region. The launch of our copper futures contract in April, 2012 was a direct result of our close working relationship with our members, as copper futures have been the most requested new contract.</p><h4>Looking at your range of future contracts/products, where have you seen the most success, and what trends do you see emerging?</h4><p>Firstly, trading volumes have been increasing. Annual volumes for 2011 on the DGCX registered a substantial growth of 110% from 2010 to reach over 4 million contracts, the highest ever annual volumes achieved by the exchange since its inception. The annual volumes for 2011 represented a value of $185.13 billion. Secondly, currencies drove the majority of volume growth on the exchange in 2011, accounting for 88% of all contracts. Currency volumes in 2011 stood at 3.6 million contracts, an increase of 177% from 2010. Indian rupee futures retained their exceptional growth momentum over the last two years, ending 2011 with 3.2 million contracts—563% growth over 2010. Precious metals accounted for the remaining 11% of the exchange's total volumes, registering 443,889 contracts. Silver futures emerged as the strongest performer of the year in the precious metals segment, rising by 40% from 2010 to aggregate 44,870 contracts in 2011. In 2012, we believe copper futures contracts will make a significant contribution to our continued success.</p><h4>What are the key tools that the DGCX offers for managing currency and commodity price risk in the region?</h4><p>The DGCX offers a number of competitive advantages. Firstly, the trading infrastructure and derivatives products provided by the exchange offer market participants exceptional financial management, risk mitigation, and profit optimization tools, giving market participants a cutting-edge, transparent, and secure technology infrastructure, combined with well-established and stringent compliance and governance standards. Secondly, transacting and clearing trades on the DGCX gives businesses the benefit of being under the purview of robust local taxation and regulatory regimes. The DGCX is regulated by the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), a full member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an association of organizations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets. Thirdly, trading on the DGCX gives international institutions the ability to tap the high growth potential of the region's derivatives market and access the large untapped pools of institutional and private liquidity in the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the 2007-2012 sectorial communications and transport program fit into the government's “Vision 2030"?</h4><p>The telecommunications and transportation projects for 2007-2012 are part of Vision 2030. They are consistent with the goal to position Mexico among the top 20% of countries with the best infrastructure development and competitiveness by the end of 2030. In order to achieve this goal, we have established objectives, actions, and projects in three critical areas: connectivity of the transportation system, integration and modernization of logistic chains, and greater use and coverage for high-tech applications in the telecoms sector. During this administration, we have invested more than $45 billion in the development of road, railway, airport, ports, and communications infrastructure. This is an unprecedented investment. In fact, during this administration, the investment in all infrastructure sectors was close to 5% of GDP, which is considerably more than Mexico used to invest. For instance, 10 years ago investments were slightly above 3%.</p><h4>What main projects has the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) implemented to improve infrastructure development in the areas most critical to Mexico's social and economic development?</h4><p>Transport infrastructure is vital for economic and social development. It facilitates the movement of goods and allows people to get to school, work, and leisure activities. The current administration has focused on providing infrastructure in strategic locations to improve people's standard of living. In terms of road infrastructure, we have built or modernized more than 18,500 kilometers of roads and highways. The Durango-Mazatlán highway, a 230-kilometer road, is one of our main road projects. It consists of a new 75-kilometer segment that forms part of a corridor linking Mexico's Pacific and Atlantic coasts. It reduces travel times up to six hours for freight vehicles and 2.5 for private cars. It is a very complex and challenging project because it goes through the mountains, which are particularly difficult and expensive to access. It has 115 bridges, 61 tunnels, and includes the tallest cable-stayed bridge in the world; the Baluarte Bicentennial Bridge, valued at $1.5 billion. Another main project is the Mexico City Northern Bypass ($548 million). It is a 224-kilometer road that avoids traffic entering the city thereby easing congestion and reducing the environmental impact. Thanks to this project, about 1 million cars will no longer have to drive through Mexico City. With regards to rail infrastructure, we have built 24 railway underpasses to keep freight trains from having to run through major urban areas. We have also built the first suburban railway in the Mexico City metropolitan area; it started operations in 2008, and transports more than 130,000 passengers per day. Regarding airport infrastructure, we have built four new terminals in Mexico City, Monterrey, San José del Cabo, and Cuernavaca. We have also modernized 13 terminals across the country, built a second runway at the Cancún airport, and built a new airport in Puerto Peñasco. This administration has also updated Mexico's port infrastructure. We have invested in specialized terminals and industrial facilities at five ports (Altamira, Tampico, Lázaro Cárdenas, Manzanillo, and Guaymas) and have built five specialized docks for cruises. In terms of telecoms, we auctioned a pair of dark-fiber strands from Mexico's electricity utility, amounting to more than 20,000 kilometers, which allows for the possibility of a third national broadband network for data, voice, and video. We allocated 30 MHz in the 1.9 GHz band and 90 MHz in the 1.7 GHz band. We have reduced interconnection rates for mobile and fixed telephone networks, and we are investing in a satellite system that includes three new satellites that will provide a platform for fixed and mobile communications, and will support the national security infrastructure, allow better natural disaster planning, and bring communications services to 70,000 communities with fewer than 500 inhabitants. The first satellite (for fixed satellite services) will be delivered to the SCT during the last quarter of 2012. The second satellite (for mobile satellite services) is planned to be delivered by the end of 2013 and the third satellite (for mobile satellite services) is scheduled to arrive during the second half of 2014.</p><div class="quote">“This administration has maintained steady levels of investments and has provided better regulations."</div><h4>How has private investment contributed to the development of infrastructure in the transportation sector?</h4><p>Private investment has played a crucial role in improving the quality and quantity of infrastructure in Mexico. In the period between 2007 and 2011, the private sector invested more than $22 billion in transport infrastructure. To boost private investment in road construction, Mexico has set  up various public-private partnership (PPP) schemes. We grant concessions to bidders who request the least financial assistance from the federal government to build, operate, and maintain new highways. We also use Project Finance Initiatives (PPS) with which the government grants a concession to a private company to design, finance, build, maintain, and operate a road, again awarding it to the bidder who requests the least amount of federal funding, and the government pays them an amount that includes the amortization of the investment plus the amount necessary for the maintenance of the road.</p><h4>According to the Competitiveness Index from the World Economic Forum, Mexico ranks 58th, gaining eight positions from 2010 to 2011. What measures should be taken in the communications and transportation sectors to keep improving Mexico's position?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Mexico has undergone important actions leading to a stronger and more competitive economy. With regards to communications and transportation, this administration has maintained steady levels of investments and has provided better regulations. In addition, new PPP legislation has recently been approved by Congress. Even though the PPP schemes in place today have brought about excellent results, now that this legislation has been passed we will be able to do much more. This legislation increases legal certainty for investors, which we expect will expedite the development of infrastructure projects in order to continue investing in infrastructure in the range of 5% of GDP annually.</p><h4>How has the telecommunications sector evolved in the last 5 years in terms of regulatory framework?</h4><p>I see the transportation and communication sectors increasing as a percentage of GDP. The telecommunications sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in Mexico; it's a very dynamic sector. As we continue to set the right regulatory framework and establish the right conditions to attract investment, we expect to see higher growth. From a regulatory perspective, we have already been working on the reduction of interconnection rates, publishing a fundamental technical plan for interconnection and interoperability, as well as guidelines for the formulation of cost models to resolve disagreements about interconnection between operators, and the portability of numbers. All of these regulatory decisions strengthen the sector and instill more confidence in potential investors. I expect there to be growth in that sector in terms of labor and employment as well. We also see the transport industry playing an important role. Over 70% of our exports to the US, for example, are transported by heavy weight vehicles, a sector that is being modernized. We are taking important steps to keep renovating and updating the truck fleet.</p><h4>How is the SCT promoting competitive tariffs and a broader geographic coverage in order to improve service access to the general population?</h4><p>Between 2007 and 2011, the prices of telecommunications services have dropped: broadband internet rates by about 37%, mobile phone rates by about 55%, and fixed residential phone lines by 24%. We have also increased coverage; for example, in terms of mobile telephone subscriptions, we have increased by 75.2%, today we have 97 million mobile telephone lines registered in Mexico, out of a total population of 112 million. In addition, COFETEL, the telecoms regulatory agency, promoted a drop in fixed and mobile interconnection rates by 68% and 57% respectively, for 2011 in comparison with 2010. We are doing quite well with regard to this comparison with other Latin American countries, but if you compare us with OECD countries we still need to keep going. The growth of mobile networks has allowed 73% of people living in areas with a population of less than 2,500 inhabitants to have access to telephone and internet services. We have a program to supply pre-paid residential telephone services for nearly 9,000 rural communities of between 500 and 2,200 inhabitants, covering a total of close to 8 million people, and another program for smaller communities, which provides service for nearly 13,000 communities with less than 500 inhabitants. Furthermore, by the end of 2012 we hope to have 24,000 Digital Community Centers, which will provide free internet access to close to 10 million people. Nowadays we have 6,788 centers located in areas with difficult access.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish Airlines (THY) is one of the only major airlines that has shown consistent growth in passenger numbers in recent years. What were the main challenges in 2011 and what is your outlook for 2012?</h4><p>It was a very important year because it was the year that the most wide-body and narrow-body aircraft were added to our fleet. It was also a year for investment—up to $750 million worth—outside of aircraft purchases. We also added 24 new destinations this year; most of them long haul. Despite this, we finished the year in profit. In 2012 we are aiming for 18%-20% growth. We also hope to increase our fleet to 195 aircraft; 29 of the planes we've ordered will have joined our fleet by the end of this year. There will be new destinations and flight points as well, and frequency increases to existing lines. For example, we've upped our flights to New York to three a day, and we're increasing the frequency of flights to Europe and the Far East. New destinations are also expected in Europe and Africa. We are planning on expanding into Central and South America. We believe that 2012 will be better than 2011, barring any unforeseen circumstances. We haven't got any unresolved problems related to our operations. It's all going smoothly. One of the most important things in 2012 will be the opening of our THY Technic facility at Sabiha Gökçen Airport in Istanbul over a 380,000-sqm area. Operations will start in 2012 for narrow-body aircraft, and then as of next year it will include wide-body aircraft. As a result, Turkish Airlines will operate one of the key aircraft maintenance facilities in the region. We've finished design plans and will begin serial production of aircraft galleys, starting with Boeing galleys, in conjunction with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). We also have an airline seat design company, which is expected to begin production in 2013. THY has various deals with US companies in other production areas too, such as with Goodrich for the production of aircraft components. On top of this, THY's pilot academy is currently graduating 100 pilots a year. We're relocating that academy and increasing the capacity to 300 pilots per year. This school is different from our Aviation Academy, which was recently IATA approved. So, it's a busy time for Turkish Airlines.</p><h4>Are these new production initiatives aimed at export too?</h4><p>Sure, it's both for us and eventually for export, the aim being to develop and expand the Turkish civil aviation industry in Turkey.</p><div class="quote">“We focus on increasing service quality to make Turkish Airlines the best option."</div><h4>What impact will these new educational developments have for THY's position in the region?</h4><p>Our schools include foreign students from other airlines in the region. It will play a great part in the growth of educated and qualified aviation staff not just in Turkey, but in the region.</p><h4>How important is the Turkish Airlines brand on the cargo side of the business?</h4><p>We eventually will make our cargo division a separate company. We have over 190 cargo destinations around the world, and our brand image as a safe and reliable airline is well established. We're one of the fastest growing cargo companies in the world. Turkey's geographical location, with Istanbul as a hub, is an important factor for our strong cargo growth.</p><h4>What trends can you identify within the cargo industry?</h4><p>Istanbul has great potential and is developing very quickly. Turkey's and Istanbul's growth and development and increased importance on the international scene have a direct impact on the growth of our business. We foresee a growth in cargo business, even though Istanbul still hasn't used more than 30% of its potential in my opinion. We need more airport facilities too; Atatürk Airport is overcrowded right now, but the new airport project should resolve that. There's a new project to dedicate an airport solely to cargo, possibly in Çorlu, or possibly as a part of Sabiha Gökçen Airport.</p><h4>There are rumors that Turkish Airlines will be acquiring a European airline. What effect will this have on THY?</h4><p>We're currently talking with the Polish national carrier, LOT Polish Airlines. We've had meetings and the process is underway to finalize this deal. This deal will of course have a positive effect on both airlines. We're not just seeking benefits for Turkish Airlines; we want it to be a win-win situation for both airlines, and both countries. We also have other deals and initiatives we're working on with other airlines, and we're evaluating various offers.</p><h4>You mentioned 24 new destinations in 2011, and new destinations in the Americas. How would you characterize the demand in South America?</h4><p>We seek to serve all three kinds of passengers: tourists, business people, and transit passengers. We find that there is a large number of transit passengers from South America to various points in Asia and the Middle East, most of which used to transfer in Europe. We would like to expand our share of transit passengers, and have increased the number of transit passengers by 18%-20% as a result of increased traffic in Istanbul. We are also active in domestic flights. There are 48 airports in Turkey, and domestic air travel is also increasing rapidly, adding to our overall growth. This positive outlook obviously has to do with Turkey's overall GDP per capita growth over the last few years.</p><h4>Do you have any other strategies to increase the number of passengers who choose Turkish Airlines?</h4><p>We focus on increasing service quality to make Turkish Airlines the best option. We think of it as a complete package, improving the flight experience, upping technology, making flights more comfortable, and adding more destinations.</p><h4>You made a big impact with your promotional deals with FC Barcelona, Manchester United, and Euroleague Basketball. How have these deals added to Turkish Airlines' popularity?</h4><p>These sponsorships have added greatly to our public exposure. We have $100 million set aside for these kinds of deals, and the sponsorship deals you mentioned will continue.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Chamber's strategy aligned with the 2012-2016 Federation of the UAE Chambers of Commerce vision?</h4><p>he Dubai Chamber was established in 1965 through a decree issued by the late Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum. He realized the important role that a chamber of commerce would play in supporting the economy, and since then the Dubai Chamber has become a major business organization in the UAE. Over the past decade, company profiles have altered dramatically and are now much more sophisticated than what they were 10 years ago. By updating and refining our products and services in line with differing business needs we have been able to attract new members and better support and protect the wider business community. Our offices are located in key commercial areas in order to make our products and services more accessible to the business community. They can be found in the Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (JAFZA), Dubai Airport Free Zone Authority (DAFZA), and Al Awir area, as well as at the Department of Economic Development (DED), Al Twar Center, and Dubai Industrial City. Our services have also changed to become more complex as doing business becomes more sophisticated. Not only do we offer documentation services for traders, we also provide legal advice and support, business networking opportunities, and economic research to the entire business community. At the same time, we are helping companies meet international standards in sustainable business through our Center for Responsible Business, and resolve commercial disputes in an amicable way through Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC). Helping our members meet best international practice is part of Dubai Chamber's strategy. Therefore, we are closely aligned with the strategy of the Federation of the UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FCCI) for the 2012-2016 period. Earlier in 2012, we hosted and participated in the first workshop for the FCCI team responsible for developing the proposed new strategy. The project is important, and the Dubai Chamber will support and contribute in any way possible to accelerate the development of the strategy, which aims to develop technical and administrative policies based on best international standards.</p><h4>As one of the world's top 10 business destinations, what are the factors that lend credibility to Dubai as an international business hub?</h4><p>Dubai has a number of benefits for international businesses, which help attract new companies every year from all corners of the globe. These include the city's strategic location in the center of the map. Dubai offers easy access to several major consumer markets and as such is one of the world's leading re-export destinations. At the same time, Dubai offers companies a safe and stable environment to do business. The city is geared toward helping companies prosper with business-friendly laws, modern infrastructure, and a diverse and predominantly young workforce. One attraction for international businesses specifically is free zones, which are tax free and allow for full ownership and profit repatriation.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai Chamber's work is geared toward creating a favorable business environment and supporting the development of enterprises."</div><h4>What products, services, and initiatives do you have in place to assist the growth of the business community in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai Chamber's work is geared toward creating a favorable business environment and supporting the development of enterprises. However, the specific initiatives that help our members expand their business include the Country Focus Briefings, which give companies an insight into potential opportunities in key markets, such as Ethiopia, Turkey, Brazil, and the Netherlands. This year we will also focus on enhancing our reputation overseas and visiting countries with which we would like to build better relations. In 1Q2012, Dubai Chamber participated in 16 events around the world in countries such as Canada, the US, Libya, Ethiopia, France, Tanzania, the UK, Belgium, and Oman to promote Dubai. We also sent three delegations, one to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, another to Surat in India, and a third to Ethiopia.</p><h4>Which regions have you identified as holding significant potential?</h4><p>The main markets we have identified include India and countries in the CIS, Africa, and Latin America. Dubai historically has strong ties with India and parts of Africa, and we are working hard to build stronger links with many countries, particularly in eastern Africa, by sending overseas delegations and hosting the Eastern African Community Forum in Dubai in October 2012. Meanwhile, Latin American and CIS countries are witnessing incredibly strong growth and we believe that our members could benefit from the opportunities being created in those parts of the world.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of exports and companies applying for membership?</h4><p>Our members' exports and re-exports last year reached AED246 billion, which is 14.5% higher compared to 2010. This total is also higher than the peak in 2008, which was AED213 billion. This expansion demonstrates the strength of the trade sector and its importance for Dubai's economic growth. As for our membership trends, last year we added 10,092 new members, which took our total membership to over 128,000. This was a percentage increase of 8.5%, which points toward the economic growth that Dubai witnessed last year. We have seen our membership increase again to over 130,000 in 1Q2012, as more companies choose to set up in the Emirate.</p><h4>What benefits will the ATA Carnet system bring to Dubai, and what motivated the initiation of the system at this stage?</h4><p>The UAE began accepting ATA Carnets for goods for use at trade fairs, shows, and exhibitions on April 1, 2011. The Dubai Chamber is the national guaranteeing and issuing agency of ATA Carnets in the UAE. Known as a “passport for goods," the ATA Carnet is an international customs document that permits the duty-free and tax-free temporary import of goods for up to one year. The UAE is the first country in the GCC to implement this system, and we are encouraging our partners across the region to also adopt it. In Dubai, there are many trade shows every year, and the adoption of this system will make importing products and goods for display much simpler and more affordable. This will be a major boost for companies working in the sector. We firmly believe it will help attract more exhibitors to Dubai, which was one reason behind our motivation to use the ATA Carnet system.</p><h4>What lessons were learned from the global liquidity crisis, and how far along the road to recovery would you say Dubai's economy is?</h4><p>The main lesson learned was about stability. We need to move away from the boom and bust years and focus on achieving sustainable growth over a longer period. And this is not just a lesson for Dubai—this applies to every economy in the world. In terms of recovery, Dubai has come a long way. The country's key economy drivers—trade, tourism, logistics, and financial services—have bounced back to their pre-crisis levels. That is not to say we are out of the woods yet, especially considering the financial pressures that continue globally. However, we are certainly on a more even footing.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are leading to increases in overall production?</h4><p>A very important step toward increasing PEMEX's production is the operation of new exploration and production (E&amp;P) integral contracts. The first bidding round has concluded, and there has been a lot of interest from potential bidders for the second round for the Southern Region. The companies that won the first bidding round are already working and are now forecasting an increase in production. Another important factor has been the development of the Ku Maloob Zaap Field, which is producing around 850,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). As for the future, we are confident that we will be able to continue to improve production at the Chicontepec Field, so that in the short term we'll be able to extract around 80,000 bbl/d.</p><h4>What annual level of investment will Pemex maintain during the next five years to finance upstream operations?</h4><p>During President Calderón's term, there has been an historical investment in PEMEX. We have built new platforms, such as the Centenario and Bicentenario, and we have continued with the reconfiguration of other assets such as the Minatitlán Refinery. We are also advancing according to plan on the construction of a new refinery in Tula. We have invested more than ever before. As a result, we have achieved the stabilization of our oil production at around 2.6 million bbl/d. In 2012, PEMEX will invest Ps249.15 billion ($19.84 billion) in the exploration, production, and development of Mexico's hydrocarbon fields. This means that we will be investing 2.8% more than in 2011. We are fully engaged in downstream development and are envisioning that we will achieve the energy independence that the country needs in the medium term. Around the world, the refining business is going through a difficult phase. In other parts of the world, several refineries have closed or are planning to close. To avoid such a dramatic outcome, we have been taking the right steps to achieve the more efficient production of gasoline.</p><h4>What is on PEMEX's agenda with regard to deepwater exploration and production?</h4><p>We are planning to develop three deep-water wells in the Perdido area in 2012: Trion, Supremos, and Maximino. For the development of these wells, we are estimating an investment of between $600 million and $800 million, or about $150 million to $200 million per well. With these projects, PEMEX will become the second most important oil company with drilling equipment in the Gulf of Mexico. We will continue with our deepwater exploration operations, and we will do so in compliance with the regulatory framework in place and with a particular emphasis on safety and environmental protection. In this regard, we have established measures that will strengthen our procedures and guarantee that the operations will take place in the safest possible way.</p><h4>How is PEMEX leveraging technology and infrastructure to minimize any negative impacts on the environment?</h4><p>We have been making our refineries more efficient and we are investing in the reconfiguration and construction of new refineries. We recently finished the reconfiguration of the Minatitlán Refinery, which is a new project in view of the technological improvements that we have developed. We have also taken a leap forward by investing in the reconfiguration of the Salamanca Refinery, and, moreover, we have started the construction of a new refinery in Tula, Hidalgo. We are confident that these steps will help reduce the gap between national consumption and production. One of the top priorities of the company is to operate in a safe and sustainable manner. In this respect, our Safety Health and Environmental Protection System (SSPA) has yielded very good results in recent years and has been key in curbing accidents. For example, we have been able to keep the index of accident frequency at 0.42 accidents per million work hours, the lowest in the history of the company, and lower than the international benchmark of 0.5. Also, in 2010, we achieved a reduction of 22.1% in the emission of polluting agents to the atmosphere, a 0.5% reduction in the use of crude water, and a 21% reduction in our inventory of hazardous materials. With regards to CO2, we have also had very encouraging results. During 2010, we were able to reduce our emissions by 4.8 million tons. To put this in perspective, this is the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road. Finally, we continue to support biodiversity conservation programs in places as diverse as the Lancandona rainforest in Chiapas, the Jaguaroundi natural reserve in Veracruz, the Centla Marshes, as well as ecosystems in Alvadaro, Tuxpan, and Tampamachoco. These are the figures for 2010. The figures for 2011 will be available shortly.</p><div class="quote">“We have been making our refineries more efficient and we are investing in the reconfiguration and construction of new refineries."</div><h4>What major challenges does the Chicontepec Field present?</h4><p>The development of the Chicontepec Field is going through a very strong phase. In January of 2012 we achieved an average production of 63,000 bbl/d, and also accomplished a historical maximum of 65,300 barrels in one day. This is the result of technological innovations and initiatives targeted to reduce costs, as well as the implementation of better operating practices. It is well known that Chicontepec is a very challenging field from a technical perspective. That is why we have installed field laboratories in different locations in order to grasp a better sense of the oil pockets and develop them accordingly. The new exploitation models used in “Presidente Alemán," for example, have yielded very positive results. This well has been subject to many technical innovations that have determined its success. It was designed to be drilled horizontally, and therefore have better contact with the productive sands, and, with this, an increased flow of oil. I think our biggest challenge at Chicontepec is finding the right technologies to increase the recovery rate from hydrocarbon pockets. I am confident that with work now in progress and the different laboratories throughout the region, we will be able to find the best techniques to make the most of this very important field.</p><h4>In your view, what role can foreign investment and expertise play in the development of Mexico's offshore oil assets?</h4><p>The oil industry is one in which learning from other experiences and collaborating in challenging projects is vital. That's why, in April 2008, President Calderón presented an energy reform proposal that was widely discussed and later approved by Congress. The reform included important changes to the legal framework of the industry and strengthened PEMEX's corporate governance, granting it greater flexibility to determine its internal structure, and provide a specific contractual scheme to face upcoming challenges. This regime is now part of the new PEMEX Law. A fundamental part of the reform was the approval of integral contracts for E&amp;P activities. These contracts seek to expand and strengthen the operations of PEMEX through a competitive model that opens the door for new areas of collaboration between PEMEX and the national and international players of the oil industry. Through this new contractual scheme, we will be able to complement PEMEX's efforts to reactivate mature fields and develop complex projects. The first bidding round for the reactivation of mature fields was very successful. The second round is currently underway and we expect it to be as successful as the first one. Another important area for collaboration is in deep-water activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The exploitation of hydrocarbons in the Gulf is a great opportunity for PEMEX and for Mexico. We have estimated that from a total of 54 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of prospective resources in the country, at least 30 billion are in deepwater fields. We are confident that these projects will also open the door for greater collaboration opportunities with other players in the industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The past year has seen Turkey play a significant role in the region. To what extent is the “zero problems with neighbors" policy still viable?</h4><p>There has been no change in our policy of “zero problems with neighbors." We still preserve our strong will toward developing relations with our neighbors and aim to focus on prospects for cooperation rather than perceptions of threats and divergences. However, we cannot control the developments that take place in our neighborhood, nor the stances that other countries adopt in the face of challenges. We stand by our values and work toward our mutual interests. The events that take place in our Middle Eastern neighborhood have the potential to produce global repercussions in terms of stability and security. We therefore pursue more pro-active policies toward averting crises and steering events in a positive direction whenever possible. It is with this understanding that we have set the “zero problems with neighbors" policy, and begun making positive contributions to stability, security, and welfare both in our region and beyond. This reflects the orientation of our foreign policy and should not be seen as a time-bound objective. The policy has been successful in creating more positive relations with most of our neighbors and has brought cooperation to the forefront. We established new mechanisms for cooperation, such as the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council, and abolished barriers in order to pave the way for further economic cooperation. We also lifted visa requirements in order to ensure more people-to-people contact and create cooperation that forges a common and positive regional identity. In other words, we tried to lift obstacles in order to form more cooperation, interaction, and welfare in our region. Of course, no one expects every problem to be solved overnight; circumstances constantly change. Moreover, relationships are inherently two sided, which indicates that the outcome of efforts toward improving ties and enhancing cooperation depends on the attitudes of many. Our relations with Israel, Syria, and Armenia should be viewed from this perspective. The current difficulties do not arise from Turkey's lack of determination to resolve problems, but rather from the policies of these countries, which are outside of our control. However, we are determined to work toward zero problems, as we believe that in the long run these efforts will lay the groundwork for solving problems.</p><h4>What is Turkey's strategy to use water as a catalyst for cooperation rather than conflict?</h4><p>One of the main principles of Turkey's water policy is to utilize its water resources in an optimal manner through cooperation among states. We are working to create the necessary environment of confidence so that we can share the benefits of water with our neighbors. To this end, Turkey has introduced modern irrigation technology and water-efficient cropping techniques as well as water conservation in urban areas. We have also built multi-purpose water infrastructure, including improved storage capacity, which is essential in arid and semi-arid regions.</p><div class="quote">“Our membership in NATO and strategic relations with the US and other Western partners in Europe constitute a fundamental pillar."</div><h4>To what extent do energy imports determine relations with neighboring countries—Iran in particular?</h4><p>Turkey is geographically located in close proximity to around 72% of the world's proven gas and around 73% of its oil reserves, in particular those of the Middle East and the Caspian Basin. Constituting a natural energy bridge between the source countries and consumer markets, Turkey meets a major portion of its oil and natural gas supplies directly from its neighbors, mainly Russia, Iraq, and Iran. Safe, secure, sustainable, and affordable energy remains a priority for the country. Therefore, Turkey attaches great importance to source and route diversification. Energy constitutes one of the most important dimensions of our bilateral economic and trade relations with Iran. Being a major regional oil and natural gas supplier, Iran has been an important energy partner for Turkey, based on our mutual commercial interests.</p><h4>Is there a conflict in fostering relations with Europe and the US as well as the Middle East and China?</h4><p>Turkey greatly values its alliance with the Euro-Atlantic community. Our membership in NATO and strategic relations with the US and other Western partners in Europe constitute a fundamental pillar of our foreign policy. However, this is in no way an obstacle to enhance our relations with every other country in our region. On the contrary, Turkey's multi-faceted and multi-dimensional ties with countries in both the East and West complement each other in a mutually reinforcing manner. In other words, our relations with one region or a country are by no means an alternative to others. The fact that Turkey has good relations with Middle Eastern countries makes the country an asset for the EU, a region with which we share common goals and principles. Turkey's accession process to the EU and active dialogue with the Euro-Atlantic community increases Turkey's credibility and added value to its neighbors and partners in the East. Increasing the level of economic cooperation with as many countries as possible has become an important priority for the country. This is among the reasons why we have increased our cooperation and engagement over a vast geography, including the emerging powers of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, all of which have become important partners for us.</p><h4>What role do you envision Turkey playing in Africa?</h4><p>Turkish-African cooperation has gained momentum in recent years, and Africa today has become a strong component of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey has become strategic partner for Africa through decisions made at the 10th African Union Summit in January 2008. In the context of our efforts to deepen our relations with the continent, we have opened 19 new embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa since May 2009. This has brought the number of the Turkish embassies on the continent to 31. This figure will reach 34 by the end of 2012. Our businessmen and entrepreneurs are becoming increasingly active in all corners of Africa, and trade volume with the continent grew to $17.1 billion in 2011, $7 billion of which was with sub-Saharan countries.</p><h4>As Turkey celebrates its 60th year as a member of the NATO Alliance, what do you believe is the significance of its membership in this region?</h4><p>Turkey's membership in NATO is an integral part of its global identity. NATO, as a unique forum for Euro-Atlantic security, also provides Turkey with the opportunity to put forward its views and expectations regarding regional and international security issues, as well as have a strong impact on transatlantic initiatives. In this new international system with many political or economic threats and challenges, I believe that NATO has the necessary capabilities to move beyond crisis management to the setting of a new international order, based on cooperative security combined with soft power instruments. Security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and the Middle East are closely linked to each other. Turkey takes the lead in the development of NATO's relations with the countries in the Middle East through partnership mechanisms such as the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI). We will continue to add value to NATO's outreach in the future. Today, Turkey not only takes part in missions and operations for collective defense and crisis management purposes, but also mobilizes its increasing “soft power," using its deep historical ties with populations and countries in the Middle East and North Africa.</p><h4>Turkey has taken over the Chairmanship of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) for 2010-2012. What are Turkey's strategic goals regarding its relations with the nations of Central Asia?</h4><p>CICA is an Asian organization bringing together strategic countries stretching from Turkey to the Republic of Korea. Therefore, during its chairmanship of CICA, Turkey aims to foster an atmosphere of dialogue in Asia. Turkey believes that establishment of an environment of trust in Asia constitutes a priority in maintaining peace in the world. With 24 member states, CICA carries the potential to be among the most important international organizations of the future, particularly taking into consideration the recent economic developments in Asia.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Does Dubai have the capacity to be a first-class global financial hub?</h4><p>Dubai is already a logistical international hub with a huge port facility. This is a city that can clear 1,200 containers per hour. We supply and re-export to many nations around us, from companies on our border to East Africa. For example, Somalia has been relying on Dubai for years, and all of its shipments and goods have been coming from Dubai. We also reach Turkmenistan, the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and North Africa. This is an international hub that seeks to consolidate its services. The vision we have is to create a financial presence outside of the Emirate, but that is yet to happen. However, we have done a lot of business in Turkey. Although Noor Islamic Bank is predominantly a corporate, wholesale bank, our activities are determined by our banking partners. We work very closely with Turkish bankers and our relationship allows us to operate together. We have now completed transactions totaling over $2 billion in 18 months; we are raising funds for Turkish financial institutions, and we have many possibilities in the pipeline. This is what we have envisioned, and we aim to duplicate this activity in Southeast Asia or North Africa. This is where we see a lot of interest and potential to grow.</p><h4>Is it your vision for Noor Islamic Bank to be global?</h4><p>Noor Islamic Bank's history began when His Highness Sheikh Mohammed sought to establish a bank with a vision to improve the Islamic banking sector. Before spreading to the rest of the world, Islamic banking actually began in Dubai. Initially the process was slow, cumbersome, and traditional, and His Highness aimed to establish a new bank that was mobile, progressive, and tolerant, with Islamic values. When the company opened in 2008, the crisis forced us to look inward. As a CEO, my only aim was to protect the newly born innovation; I did not want to deviate from our goal. However, we redirected the strategy to focus on preservation and containing our capital. Now we are absolutely unleveraged and do not take or borrow money from any source. Thanks to our capital deposits, we also have zero debt. I believe that we became survivalists; we never forgot our vision despite tough circumstances and a trying environment. We are focused on the short term, and the bank now understands the risks; our appetite and ability to manage is evolving. We are an almost 55% state-owned bank, and this gives us an advantage in terms of decision-making. We would love to be the global brand for Islamic banks. In our experience, the industry is still small, and if you cannot consolidate the only option is to cooperate. If we hadn't cooperated with Turkey, we would not have been able to finance $2 billion. If we want to be global, we must pool together to become sizable and compete with international banks. I believe that cooperation is a very good approach toward becoming competitive. We do not yet have a concrete plan for consolidation. I believe that cooperation has been the best starting point for Noor Islamic Bank.</p><h4>Is there a misconception that Islamic banks are heavily exposed to real estate investments and not as reliable as their conventional counterparts?</h4><p>I do think these misconceptions exist to a certain degree. Historically, Islamic banks have always looked at asset-based finance, and this is how the model started in the beginning. However, the model of Islamic banks has devolved significantly, and today there are many products that meet almost every need. There is plenty of room for creativity, and the consumer side has already established clear products. The wholesale side of banking still needs improvement, and every transaction involves innovation. Some of our experiences deal with a number of large companies. We sought opportunities to prove that we do not simply want to manage property finances, and we have been able to create a very good structure.</p><div class="quote">“In a place like Dubai, even the non-Muslim customers understand the Islamic banking system."</div><h4>Is further regulation the solution?</h4><p>People say that Islamic banks need more regulation in order to grow, but I say our industry grows without regulation. We create the industry first, and then regulation follows. If we had to stop to wait for the regulator to come, the sector could not evolve. The authorities can analyze our models and then regulate.</p><h4>How significant is the retail banking division for Noor Islamic Bank?</h4><p>Retail banking is important for Islamic banks. We are a fully licensed bank that engages in every type of business activity. Typically, retail has been a source of income that takes longer to build—it is a volume-based business that has been growing slowly. We have been carefully following digital media solutions, and we are aware that the next generation of customers do not typically come to the branch anymore. We have to promote and implement innovative products. For example, we were the first bank to introduce internet and phone banking in Arabic that could be used on any mobile unit. We were even approached by Google to devise ways to write from right to left. Noor Islamic Bank also introduced online account opening technology, because the upcoming generation seeks new types of relations. These are some of our interests that we are trying to demonstrate on the consumer side. There are many players in the consumer business market, and my hope is to see the business split 50:50 between wholesale and consumer banking.</p><h4>Does the bank have a significant non-Muslim customer base?</h4><p>In a place like Dubai, even the non-Muslim customers understand the Islamic banking system, unlike a non-Muslim brand in a Muslim market. I would say that the non-Muslim segment makes up almost 44% of our customer base. We never use Islamic banking jargon, because our non-Muslim customers require the same products. We are a bank that can compete with all the others.</p><h4>Have you witnessed increased demand in terms of project financing?</h4><p>Actually, demand has slowed down compared to 2011, but we expect it to increase again. For our economy in this challenging period, we think it is important to continue spending on infrastructure, which can help save the economy from the effects of the ongoing crisis around the globe. I'm aware that there are many projects in the pipeline, but it's difficult to be involved in project finance without issuance.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some highlights from your operations over the last year?</h4><p>DHL is a clear market leader in both international and domestic express deliveries in the Kazakhstani market historically, and over the last year we have continued our growth. We carried out many operations in order to meet customer requirements, and to satisfy customer demand in terms of fast transportation. This includes not only documents, but parcels and heavy shipments within Kazakhstan and internationally. Kazakhstan is the ninth biggest country in the world, and transportation and infrastructure are very important for Kazakhstan's economy. Moreover, we absolutely support the strategic efforts to utilize all transit opportunities and to turn Kazakhstan into a transit corridor between Asia and Europe, and the north and south of Asia. Apart from this transportation system, for us it's important to see good growth in comparison with the average growth of the transportation sector in Kazakhstan. Our estimation is that all of Kazakhstan's modes of transport will grow. In 2011, growth came in at around 14%, while we have also shown double-digit growth. This year is also going well in terms of shipments and revenues.</p><h4>What trends do you see in terms of Kazakhstan's connectivity?</h4><p>What we found in 2011 was that customer demand was pushing us toward faster transit times within the domestic market, and in particular to and from Astana. The traditional way of moving goods to Astana is via Almaty, which serves as a hub. This puts an additional day onto the delivery time. We then performed market tests in terms of transit performance and made adjustments. DHL has now improved transit times across the country to Astana to between one and three days, depending on the origin. For example, in August 2011 we launched a direct air connection between Moscow, Russia, and Astana, Kazakhstan, for all shipments between the two cities. As a result of the new connection, DHL customers can take advantage of unprecedented service levels for their shipping requirements between the two countries. The company can now offer a transit time on the route of just one day for standard express shipments.</p><div class="quote">“DHL is a clear market leader in both international and domestic express deliveries in the Kazakhstani market historically."</div><h4>How is the Kazakhstani market evolving?</h4><p>DHL knows that the Kazakhstani market requires a wide range of services and products, beyond just shipping between Almaty and Astana in order to meet all customer requirements. Over the last year, there have been some interesting developments. The Customs Union started to function properly, and we have seen an increasing number of shipments between Kazakhstan and Russia, and Kazakhstan and Belarus. Companies such as DHL Express are really indicators of business activity, and we certainly noticed a jump in the number of shipments and active customers interested in making deliveries throughout the Customs Union. Interestingly, shipments to international destinations such as the US, France, the UK, and China also increased significantly. This is a good indicator of the diversifying nature of Kazakhstan's economy.</p><h4>What competition do you see in the market now that there's heightened demand for deliveries?</h4><p>The most competitive area is the domestic market as the barriers to entry are very low, and any man and his truck can do a domestic delivery. Probably the most competitive line would be Russia, because this is an area where the majority of volumes are. We are growing very quickly, but we have to differentiate this market from the postal market because our main market is business-to-business next-day delivery.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for DHL in the logistics sector?</h4><p>The biggest challenge that we face in the local market is in bringing shipments into the country; specifically, there have been times when we have experienced limited capacity. If you don't have the capacity, you don't fulfill your customers' expectations. Similarly, when you ship to smaller cities by air there is also limited capacity. We are too dependent on local airlines and their success. We depend on them and their capacity, and this is a major challenge.</p><h4>What innovative solutions are you introducing to enhance your clients' experience with DHL?</h4><p>I think from a strategic perspective in 2012, we would like our employees and all of our customers to ask the question: “Why wouldn't I work with DHL?" It sounds corny, but from a customer service perspective, if you have a large market share and the market diversifies, the risk of losing market share or growth is high. How do you protect that market share? Through the customer experience. If I have a courier and he goes to a customer every day for two or three years, there's a relationship that's established. If I have a courier that goes there every two months and leaves DHL, and then another one goes for another two months and so on, there is an increased risk that our customers might leave us. So, customer service and employee satisfaction are probably the most crucial factors in terms of where we are going right now. We introduced some European innovations here in Kazakhstan, which made business easier for customers. We also introduced online solutions for customers in order to make the customer's own business more accessible and DHL Express services easier to use. We are ready to provide our customers with a preview on the internet with full details to track and trace their shipments. They can select DHL shipping options, which allow them to manage their database, and that makes DHL usage easy.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mean-well-do-well]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With so many large state-owned insurance firms dominating the insurance landscape in Iran, what was the opportunity you saw for this company?</h4><p>I was involved in the insurance industry for over 35 years in state-owned companies. Altogether, I worked for seven different state-owned insurance companies, so I was pretty much familiar with the insurance industry in Iran. Along with some others who cared about the insurance industry, we found no way other than to privatize this industry in order to improve it. It was not to make a profit out of it—just to improve it. We went to the Parliament for many years lobbying for the industry, ever since Hashemi Rafsanjani was the President. Finally, we got a license and the provisional approval of the government to establish the first private insurance company in the country. That was back in 1382 in our calendar (2003/04). We were the first private insurance company to be founded in Iran.</p><h4>What is your company's relationship with Bank Karafarin? Are there group policies you have to follow?</h4><p>There are four different Karafarins: Karafarin Bank, Karafarin Insurance, Karafarin Leasing Company, and Karafarin Investment Company. The name was chosen three years ago by myself and the other founders of the Karafarin Group. The relationship between Karafarin Insurance and Karafarin Bank is that it has a 10% stake in the insurance company, and we are a 10% shareholder of the bank. Two-thirds of the board members are the same.</p><h4>Karafarin Bank mainly focuses on corporate clients. Does Karafarin Insurance have a similar policy?</h4><p>No, we don't. We do have a general strategy, but the market is so competitive we cannot be as selective. At the same time, we have to be very cautious because we have to evaluate our risks and be very competitive. Since private companies entered the market—there are 16 already—the level of competition has become much higher. We are naturally careful about the people and clients we do business with. If you are not, you are not going to make a profit consistently. When the economy is very bad the situation becomes bad. Theft and fraud are increasing every day, and that is a risk for the insurance industry.</p><h4>What products you are focusing on? What is your strategy and target market?</h4><p>Our insurance company offers one particular product that   was not present in Iran: universal life insurance. We pioneered the use of this product. Universal life insurance, or in other words, life and investment insurance, has existed in the West for over 70 years and we brought this product here.</p><p>One of the main targets for all insurance companies around the world is to improve the take up rate of life insurance and personal accident insurance policies. This was not so widespread in Iran and in this regard we increased the share of life insurance to some 50% of our portfolio. In other companies this figure is less than 10%.</p><h4>How did you persuade customers to purchase life insurance policies?</h4><p>Two main factors made this product very popular. First, this product was already well known, used, and tested for over 50-60 years in the West. In this product two main factors are united: life insurance and investment. By insuring yourself you are also investing in the economic growth of Iran as well. It is more beneficial and profitable.</p><p>When people see that they can insure themselves and, in the meanwhile, mitigate the risks of inflation, this makes them much more interested in this product. They receive the equivalent of 15% interest on this type of policy, which is a similar rate to what they would be getting from a bank. We also have a very professional sales force and management who run this division, and all this helped make this product 50% of our portfolio.</p><h4>Do you plan to expand the portion of your business generated from life insurance?</h4><p>In just five years we have already signed 200,000 life insurance policies. The average validity of the contracts is for 10 years and the average sum insured is from $50,000 to $100,000. We have 25 head branches around Iran in the main cities for everything we offer, not just for life insurance. We also have many agencies. For example, the Esfahan branch has more than 500 brokers and agents. We have around 1,400 agents and brokers, out of which 200 are specialized in life insurance.</p><h4>You are different from the other companies in Iran because they focus more on car and motor insurance.</h4><p>We avoid car insurance. We try to control it as far as we can because these products are very short term and risky. There are many accidents, and they decrease your profit.</p><h4>What is the future for the life insurance industry now that new companies are beginning to offer their policies?</h4><p>By law you cannot monopolize this product, though as we were the pioneers of it we received exclusive rights over it for a short period. Many customers come to Karafarin looking only for life insurance. This product is a part of the Karafarin brand.</p><h4>Now that all the main state-owned insurance companies are being privatized, what changes do you expect in the sector and how will the country benefit from this transition?</h4><p>Before the Revolution, we had only 11 private insurance companies and one state-owned insurer. But afterwards it took something like 20 years to have 22 state-owned and privatized companies in the market. There were only three state-owned companies left initially, and they were returned to the private sector during 2010. The only one left in state hands is Iran Insurance. The main purpose in privatizing the insurance industry is to improve the economy. Since we did not have any private insurance companies or banks until a couple of years ago, we did not have enough well-trained young managers familiar with the insurance culture or the intricacies of the industry at first. Now the number of well-trained staff is expanding rapidly. The main hope is that private insurance companies will provide a better variety of insurance products and services to the Iranian people. After all, banking and insurance are the two main wings of the economy in any country.</p><h4>What products became more widespread in use after privatization?</h4><p>Construction quality insurance had not existed before the advent of the private insurance industry. Credit insurance has also improved after privatization. That was also new for Iran, but since the private sector entered the market the availability of these kinds of products has expanded.</p><p>One particular type that I am working on and am completing now is a pension plan for individuals and organizations. Pensions are something that we do not have. Everyone has a government pension, but an individual pension that will supplement the government pension was not available. I did have a working plan that I introduced to the market, and I realized after a couple of years that it was welcome but needed certain adjustments because it was based on the French pension model, and all the technical formulas for the business were based on 1988-1990 French actuarial tables. We are waiting for the right market conditions to release this product.</p><h4>What helps to differentiate Karafarin Insurance from its rivals in the industry?</h4><p>We keep our edge not with products or prizes, not with the selection of agents or pampering, and not by advertising. We really go to the core of the insurance concept, which is service. A person who buys insurance buys it with the idea that if something goes wrong, we are there to help. And if nothing happens, there should also be something there for them. On both issues, we have been up front with the agents and brokers and they trust us.</p><p>They know that if they have a claim it is taken care of immediately. Some companies accept an application, issue a policy, and if a claim comes in and they discover evidence of prior knowledge of illness in the person's history, then they refuse to pay because they say the claimant did not provide the correct information. I consider that very picky.</p><p>We perform proper underwriting, conduct tests, send a potential policy holder for physical exams, and the end result is that our claim to premium ratio has been less than 30% for the last six years. It is profitable for us, but at the same time our customers are happy because when they make a claim, they know we will pay. The agents feel good, and they know that we mean well and do well. We stand behind our work, and for that reason everyone comes to us—even the agents of other insurance companies—to buy our life insurance policies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main sources of cement demand in Iran? Do you see this demand profile changing in the coming 3-5 years?</h4><p>Iran has a very large young population that doubled in size over the past 30 years, and the need for rehabilitation, the establishment of new towns, infrastructure projects, and the country's ever-growing economy all account for this high level of demand. Cement consumption per capita was about 640 kilograms in 2009. We expect cement consumption will grow at the rate of about 10% per year for the next three years. We are also in pursuit of creating new areas for the use of cement. For instance, we are trying to promote asphalt cement and persuade local governments to use cement instead of bitumen on roads and pavements for construction. This new usage of cement in Iran will produce a sizable demand for our products.</p><h4>The production capacity of the Iranian cement industry is growing steadily through the entrance of private firms. What are your goals and strategies for this changing market?</h4><p>With the arrival of the new private firms, Iran's cement production capacity will increase to 89 million tons per year by 2013. It is expected that local cement consumption in that year will be about 67 million tons per year, however. The surplus is therefore planned for export to overseas markets in the region, at first, by means of effective promotion and marketing, by focusing on the development and utilization of appropriate transportation means, whether by land, sea or rail, as well as creating the relevant terminals to service these transport modes. Also, we will seek to implement a production distribution management system, assigning cement plants near the border for exports and devoting the rest to the local market.</p><div class="quote">“Until 2008, the demand for cement was higher than the supply, and therefore the government had to control exports, prices, and logistics."</div><p>We also aim to protect our share in the local market. One of the strategies we will follow will be through buying stakes in other companies through the Tehran Stock Exchange. Thus, as a holding company, we will preserve our market share.</p><h4>FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is the largest cement producer in Iran. How would you describe its structure?</h4><p>The Social Security Organization is the main investor in the Iranian cement industry and is FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding's major shareholder through its two main holding companies. In total, there are 17 cement companies (having 18 plants) and more than 15 specialized companies related to the cement industry under the control of FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding.</p><p>Our current clinker production capacity is about 23.3 million tons per year, while its market share in August 2010 was almost 35%. The value of cement and cement products sold in 2009 reached $980 million.</p><h4>After the export restrictions, which ended recently, Iranian cement companies began regional exports. What will be the role of exports in the future for the Iranian cement industry?</h4><p>Until 2008, the demand for cement was higher than the supply, and therefore the government had to control exports, prices, and logistics. With the current expansion of the cement industry, a surplus in cement products is foreseen in the near future. Taking into account the strong demand for cement in Iran's neighbors, this surplus can be exported to these markets. Iraq, Afghanistan, countries of the CIS, and Persian Gulf states are the immediate markets, though more distant markets could also be considered.</p><h4>The government has plans to remove energy subsidies. What would be the effect of this policy on domestic producers?</h4><p>Around 40% of total costs for a world-class cement producer come from energy, while in Iran this share is about 14% of total costs thanks to the government's subsidies. It is now planning to lift this advantage gradually in three to five years. The government, of course, will help industries overcome any disadvantages they experience, by improving energy consumption, for example, through financial and technical assistance. The effect of this policy on the cement industry will mostly be on profit margins. Producers will have to work hard to minimize any potential losses by improving management, productivity, and efficiency. Producers will also need to work hard to maintain their market share both in foreign and local markets in the midst of the tough competition between the older players in the public sector and newcomers in the private sector.</p><h4>What is the role of foreign investors in your future strategy? What are you doing to attract foreign investment to your company?</h4><p>FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is currently negotiating with a leading international company to explore and expand into overseas markets by establishing a joint-venture company. Other companies in Iran have also benefitted from the technical and financial assistance that foreign investors can provide.</p><h4>Do you think the Iranian cement industry could do more to improve its record on the environment?</h4><p>Like many other industries in the world, the cement industry in Iran is facing the challenge of protecting the environment. FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is one of the pioneers of environmental protection activities in the Iranian cement industry, and we have an active engineering services company that controls pollution levels. We have been active in installing dust collecting equipment in several cement plants and in applying other measures to ensure compliance with environmental standards. FKCC/Tamin Cement Holding is a sponsor of Iran's biodiversity and has a strict policy of periodical site visits to control environmental issues. The Iranian Department of the Environment supervises all of these activities.</p><h4>What do you think foreign investors should know about Iran and the local cement industry?</h4><p>Iran's cement industry has the capability to attract investors and enjoys a great deal of potential for development and progress. Its geographical advantage for the international trade in cement products is just one among many, thanks to its suitable location in the heart of the Middle East and its natural connection to all parts of the world through the Persian Gulf waterway as well as via overland connections to states in the CIS region and Turkey. All this has turned Iran into a unique strategic area.</p><p>In raw materials, Iranian cement plants have many desirable deposits of limestone, gypsum, and clay close to production facilities, and in many cases there is no need for extraction using explosives. Kaolin, pozzolan and many other additives and raw material mines are also readily available.</p><p>Iran can produce the best quality cement in the region. The Iranian national standard for cement was published 50 years ago, and the observation of this standard is mandatory for all cement producers in Iran. All cement plants have specific and specialized labs for quality control. In addition, more than 20,000 skilled employees are working in the management, engineering and technical departments of the cement industry and more than 80% of the equipment and machinery needed for greenfield projects is manufactured locally.</p><p>Our engineering services company has the capability and know-how to carry out and execute engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects, including management, plant design, mechanical and electrical installation, and construction.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Kazakhstan unique in establishing a favorable tax climate vis-í -vis the other emerging economies in the CIS region?</h4><p>Tax rates in Kazakhstan are among the lowest in the world. What differentiates Kazakhstan's tax system from that of its neighboring countries is a general low tax burden on the economy, which is achieved through low rates that form the state budget. Along with this, our tax system also includes a number of preferences aimed at creating a favorable investment climate. The corporate income rate has been reduced to 20%, and the term for the transfer of losses from business activities has been increased to 10 years. Payments for individuals, entrepreneurs, and small businesses have been reduced. Furthermore, the VAT rate is 12%—one of the lowest among the world's standard tax rates. The code provides taxpayers with the possibility for investment tax preferences, which allows full deductions while calculating the corporate income tax. In addition, the tax law provides special treatment for organizations operating in economic zones, which exempts them from paying corporate income tax, property tax, and land tax payments under certain conditions, as well as the application of a zero VAT rate on the turnover of sales in the zone. For taxpayers operating in the ICT sector, an additional exemption from social security tax is applied. Also exempt from taxation are dividends and capital gains for the relatively long-term ownership of stocks and shares, as well as the sources of income separate from subsoil use in Kazakhstan. In the World Bank's Doing Business 2012 report, Kazakhstan ranked 13th in terms of taxation, well ahead of other countries in the CIS region and Eastern Europe. An assessment of the overall tax rate reveals that Kazakhstan boasts one of the lowest tax rates in the world, ranked 40th ahead of countries such as the UK, Norway, Russia, Germany, and the US.</p><h4>How would you describe the main anchors of the new banking law and the improvements it will bring to the system?</h4><p>Since 2008, Kazakhstan faced the consequences of the crisis in the global financial system, which required a quick and timely response from the government. Hence, the state supported second-tier banks in order to maintain liquidity and stability, as they are integral elements in the economic system and can ensure the normal functioning and development of the market. The state provided financial support to the banking sector to maintain lending to the real economy and its overall stability. These measures were taken in a timely and effective way. The global crisis provided an opportunity to identify the main causes of the instability of financial institutions vis-í -vis economic shocks. Lack of information transparency, low capitalization, a high concentration of business operations with high risk, poor corporate governance, and a weak degree of responsibility by the supervisory authorities are among the main causes of the instability. Therefore, in December 2011 we adopted a new law to minimize risks. The amendments are aimed at leveling the shortcomings and increasing the transparency of financial institutions. To strengthen the consolidated supervision of banking conglomerates by minimizing the risks of financial institutions from transactions with related parties, major changes were made. The important rules were the introduction of transparency schemes and the improvement of the quality of financial institutions. The crisis also led to the introduction of early response indicators for actors in the financial sector. At the same time, the responsibility of these actors increased, including improving corporate governance that ensures the accurate disclosure of financial accountability.</p><div class="quote">“What differentiates Kazakhstan's tax system from that of its neighboring countries is a general low tax burden on the economy."</div><h4>How would you assess the importance of the Eurasian Economic Community Anti-Crisis fund? What is the scope of Kazakshtan's involvement in the process?</h4><p>The 2008 global economic crisis significantly affected the Eurasian economies and the conditions of their development. Much of our efforts are devoted to basic anti-crisis policies. In order to overcome the negative effects of the crisis on national economies, ensure economic and financial stability, and promote the further deepening of economic integration, the Eurasian Economic Community developed an anti-crisis fund. Since its inception, the fund has provided financial support to Tajikistan and Belarus. In terms of the scope of Kazakhstan's involvement in the fund, the country is the second largest shareholder with an initial contribution of $1 billion, second after Russia. In turn, we believe that the fund should be used for investment projects aimed at deepening the integration process and to ensure sustainable economic development.</p><h4>How will the creation of a development bank affiliated with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) contribute to economic progress in the region?</h4><p>Based on the current global economic risks, it is advisable to create a financial institution that will promote the efficient use of resources that can expand economic and trade relations as well as industrial and investment cooperation with the SCO. Regional cooperation through the establishment of international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are integral in achieving specific goals to maintain and develop the economies of the member states. The experience of international development institutions shows that such financial institutions play a specific role in times of financial crisis, using their privileges, immunities, and resistance to high risks to continue and even increase investments in priority sectors. During the SCO meeting of the Council of Heads of Government on November 7, 2011 in St. Petersburg, the Chinese side proposed the establishment of the Development Bank of the SCO, a body that will providing financial services for medium- and long-term investments for public and private clients.</p><h4>What are the highlights in terms of bond issuance in 2011?</h4><p>Domestic government borrowing is set to finance the budget deficit and maintain sufficient government securities, with a vision to establish an appropriate reference point in the stock market. In 2011, the Ministry of Finance issued state valuable papers with maturities of one to 20 years, in the amount of approximately $4.5 billion. Today, despite the absence of sovereign Eurobonds, the domestic corporate sector is actively issuing corporate bonds. According to experts, the global market is now characterized by high volatility, which may adversely affect the value of a possible sukuk issuance. In general, given the lack of need for external borrowing, as well as the current situation, the Ministry of Finance has no plans to issue Eurobonds or sovereign sukuks in 2012. However, in the medium term, the Ministry considers these issuances as a possibility.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

Nearly half (48%) of the CEOs polled worldwide believe that the global economy will decline even further in the next 12 months. However, 40% of CEOs said they are “very confident" about revenue growth for their companies in the next 12 months.</p><h4>What actions are CEOs taking regarding the work force?</h4><p>More than half of CEOs worldwide expect to increase headcount in the next 12 months, although the picture changes from sector to sector with hiring much more likely in the entertainment and media segments.</p><h4>How do CEOs perceive the euro zone crisis?</h4><p>Unsurprisingly, the largest decline in confidence was found in Western Europe. Just a quarter of European CEOs said they were very confident of revenue growth, down sharply from nearly 40% last year. While 56% of CEOs said their company had been financially affected by the sovereign debt crisis, 45% said they had taken steps to respond.</p><div class="quote">“40% of CEOs said they are 'very confident' about revenue growth for their companies in the next 12 months."</div><h4>What are the main concerns for global CEOs?</h4><p>Looking at what is worrying CEOs, 80% had some concerns about uncertain economic growth, 64% about instability in capital markets, 66% about government responses to fiscal deficits and debt burden, 58% about exchange rate volatility, and 56% about over regulation.</p><h4>Where do CEOs foresee the main growth opportunities?</h4><p>According to the CEOs we surveyed, the best strategic growth opportunities in the next 12 months will come from increasing their share in existing markets and from developing new products and services, both cited by nearly one third of respondents.

Only 30% said they are “very confident" they will have access to the talent needed to execute their company's strategy, and 43% believe that it has become more difficult to hire workers in their industry. Recruiting and retaining high potential middle managers is the largest talent challenge, CEOs said, followed by hiring skilled production employees and younger workers.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-top-of-the-game]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the establishment of Asia Insurance and how did its business evolve?</h4><p>After the Revolution, Asia Insurance was one of the 10 private insurance companies that continued to operate. In the first years of the Revolution, many of these companies joined Asia Insurance and created a new entity that operated as a state-owned enterprise (SOE) until 2009. In late 2007, the government agreed to privatize Asia Insurance. As a result, our shares were sold on the Tehran Stock Exchange. By our 50th anniversary, Asia Insurance had become the biggest private insurance company in the country.</p><h4>What services does Asia Insurance provide to its customer base?</h4><p>Right now, Asia Insurance has around 1,700 agencies and 2,700 employees. If you add the number of employees at our agencies, then the total rises to around 12,000. One of Asia Insurance's fortes is its extensive branch network, which is present in every corner of Iran. The solid background of our agencies and the quality of service they provide to the public give our company a strong advantage in the insurance business. Equally, our highly trained insurance experts provide Asia Insurance with a competitive edge over other insurance companies in the market. In fact, many of the managing directors and other senior managers of the new insurance companies in the Iranian market are former Asia Insurance employees. If anything, this shows the technical experience that Asia Insurance has when compared to our local competitors.</p><h4>What are your growth plans for the future?</h4><p>We hope that as a privatized company we will be able to better explore other opportunities in our local market. For example, we see a great deal of potential for growth in the life insurance market. Happily, we have a solid background in this sector.</p><h4>Will a sustained high inflation rate affect your plans to expand in life insurance?</h4><p>We do not consider inflation as a major problem, but merely as a factor that is considered in our calculations. In life insurance we have to be accurate and careful to account for future conditions to ensure long-term returns.</p><p>Asia Insurance currently has around 6% of the life insurance market, though our goal is to reach a market share of 50%. In order to ensure improved progress in this field, we are looking to establish an independent company specializing in life insurance. As a result of our background and experience, we hope to do better than our rivals.</p><h4>In Iran, the penetration rate per capita for insurance is significantly lower than it is internationally. How do you explain these statistics?</h4><p>This is because the statistics you are referring to only consider commercial insurance activities and do not cover social insurance. In Iran, there are two or three large organizations that provide social insurance and governmental support for the public at large, such as the Social Security Organization and the Medical Services Insurance Organization. If we add these two public organizations to the activities of the commercial insurance sector then the penetration rate for insurance is far higher than the figures otherwise suggest.</p><h4>What kinds of insurance are compulsory in Iran? Are the government and the insurance industry educating society on the need for insurance?</h4><p>The only mandatory form of insurance is car third-party liability insurance. With the assistance of the government, we are currently establishing a new foundation to cover the dangers and risks related to natural disasters. It has been decided that the premiums to be paid into this foundation will be set at an affordable level for the people. The premiums will be partially collected through a levy on water and electricity bills, and the rest will be covered by the government. As a result, all Iranian households will be covered by an insurance policy up to a specified ceiling in case of damage caused by fire, earthquake, flood, and other natural disasters. While the government is supporting the foundation of this organization, it will be operated independently by the insurance industry.</p><h4>Do you experience any problems in finding human capital in Iran?</h4><p>We have experienced no problems in finding the human resources we need in Iran, and we have established a long-term program to address our needs as a private sector player. We intend to increase the amount we invest in our human resources to improve the company's competitiveness as a private sector entity.</p><h4>What were the effects of privatization on the company and the sector?</h4><p>There were three events that happened in the course of the privatization drive for the insurance industry. First, private insurance companies were allowed to start operating in the Iranian market, and so far 16 private insurance companies have been established, although most them are relatively small in size. Secondly, three of the four state-owned insurance companies were sold off to the private sector. The only one that was not privatized was Iran Insurance. The last company to be privatized was Dana Insurance, which was sold off quite recently. The third event that occurred in the privatization drive was the advent of increased competition in the market following the removal of the tariff system. Tariff classification was abolished almost two years ago and now companies have to compete in the market on price. The competition is even more intense, in part due to the new companies that have been established in the country. We hope that this competition will enable us to improve our ability to be more responsive to the needs of the market and the public, and be able to increase our connections to the international economy.</p><h4>What changed in Asia Insurance after its privatization?</h4><p>From a management perspective, after the company's privatization the shareholders became the decisive factor in voting for and selecting the board of directors and management team. This means that our shareholders are now actively involved in the management of the company, and with the increased competition in the market we hope the company will be able to engage in a broader range of activities.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to be active in neighboring markets?</h4><p>In terms of economic activity, the strongest relationships usually occur with our closest neighbors. Currently, we have a company in Azerbaijan owned by Asia Insurance, and we intend to open new companies in the Persian Gulf region, such as in Iraq, as well as in Turkey.</p><h4>What was your annual turnover last year?</h4><p>The amount of written premiums for Asia Insurance was over $600 million, though our revenues are obviously more than this as car insurance creates good levels of turnover. I would estimate that total revenues are more than double the amount I quoted for written premiums.</p><h4>Do you need more foreign investment in the country?</h4><p>There are some foreign companies that bought direct stocks in local insurance companies with the authorization of the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs and the Iranian Privatization Organization. We are also thinking of attracting some foreign shareholders, though we will likely undertake a few in-house reforms before that happens. Obviously, we have had offers in the past three years, but we decided to delay acting on them until after we had a listing on the stock exchange and undertook some reforms in the company. After these changes, we may increase our asset base with the help of investment from other large international insurance companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[offset-grow]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's defense industry has grown significantly since the government's policy to increase investment in local R&amp;D in 2004. How has the use of offset agreements helped to encourage this growth?</h4><p>It is a remarkable fact that Turkey's defense industry has grown significantly in the last decade, and offsets played an important role in this growth. It should be remembered that, in Turkey, offset policies and applications were identified by our Ministry after taking the needs of our defense industry into consideration. Within this context, two offset directives have been published since 2004 with the aim of directing offset activities toward the defense, homeland security, and aerospace industry to raise the level of local content and increase export capacities as well as our share in the global defense/aerospace market. Moreover, in order to improve the penetration of the defense sector in Turkish industry, we made the necessary changes in our offset policies to encourage SMEs to be more involved in defense procurement programs. We believe that such changes in the offset policy have encouraged Turkish companies to create their own indigenous designs for defense acquisition projects, which eventually resulted in the growth of the defense industry. On the other hand, it should be kept in mind that offset programs not only create additional business possibilities for defense industry companies, but can also be utilized as a significant instrument to realize new investments in Turkey's defense sector. In such cases, both the investment amount and the exports to be realized as a result of this investment are accepted as offsets.</p><h4>Which Turkish defense products do you believe are the most competitive on the international marketplace?</h4><p>I believe that both land and naval platforms are very competitive on the international market, especially coast guard boats, fast intervention boats, and modern patrol boats that are produced by our shipping industry. Also, Turkey has reached a certain level of technology in armored and tactical wheeled vehicles, and those land platforms are highly reputable and widely exported. In addition to those platforms, I would like to mention the amphibious assault bridge project, which is being locally developed for the specific requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces. This product has a great potential market, as it is unique in its category.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey's vision has significantly changed from direct procurements to indigenous projects over the last decade."</div><h4>What steps are being taken to achieve Turkey's aspirations in the aerospace industry? How has TAI helped to boost Turkey's global profile in this industry?</h4><p>Turkey has given particular attention to aerospace projects, especially in recent years. There has been a remarkable increase in indigenous projects such as the Anka and Hürkuş, and Turkey is aiming to have its own fighter aircraft by 2023. Turkey's leading aerospace company, TAI, is a key player in these local projects. While on the one hand we are moving to locally designed and manufactured platforms, on the other hand we are supporting the involvement of SMEs in aerospace projects. In the aerospace industry, it is crucial to follow standards, and it takes time to developed local industry up to the necessary levels. Via offsets, we encourage foreign companies to work with local industry, especially in areas where the technology is moving toward export potential. SMEs can also benefit from TAI's experience via the Kazan Hub, through which they can become sub-contractors for TAI easily.</p><h4>How will the new light helicopter program fit into Turkey's growing defense manufacturing capabilities?</h4><p>Turkey's vision has significantly changed from direct procurements to indigenous projects over the last decade. Turkey now has the vision to establish a local aerospace industry that will have the ability to design, test, manufacture, and export aircraft. The aim is not just to manufacture aircraft, but to have them manufactured to world standards and made compatible with their competitors. In order to achieve this goal, both industry and government need to harmonize their activities. With TAI being the prime contractor, guiding local sub-contractors, and the SSM governing and directing TAI and local industry, the helicopter program will be a success story for the coming generation.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to establish Ankara as a hub for the defense industry? Are there other manufacturing centers, such as Kırıkkale, that are also surging ahead?</h4><p>Most defense industry companies, such as TAI, ASELSAN, HAVELSAN, Roketsan, FNSS, and MKEK are all set up either in Ankara or in its vicinity. We are eager to improve the involvement of SMEs in the defense industry. In that sense, we have initiated the establishment of a hub adjacent to TAI's facilities in Kazan (Ankara) in April 2011. An area of 3 millionsqm was reserved for the Kazan Hub, and it is expected that 100-200 sub-industry companies and SMEs will benefit from it. This industrial zone will be a clustered and specialized establishment, especially for the aerospace sector, to improve the manufacturing, technological, and management capabilities of the companies present under the leadership of TAI. In addition to this hub, there is another defense and aviation cluster, called OSSA, situated in the organized industrial region of OSTİM in Ankara. This cluster was built in July 2008, and houses 89 SMEs that aim to become preferred sub-suppliers in the international defense marketplace. Running parallel to these initiatives, the Ankara Development Agency has declared Ankara as being at the heart of the defense sector, and announced that there will be incentives for clustering activities on offer in the defense sector. By these means, the involvement of local industries in defense procurement programs will be realized in a broader sense.</p><h4>Turkey is becoming renowned for its military electronics and armored vehicles. Where do these segments of the industry stand in a global context?</h4><p>Turkey has become an emerging and well-known actor in military electronics and armored vehicle systems in recent years. This can easily be seen by taking a brief look at the export statistics. In military electronics, ASELSAN, HAVELSAN, and many large-, medium-, and small-sized companies are gaining power in communications, simulators, electro-optics, jamming, weapon control systems, and similar military applications on a global basis. In addition, Otokar, FNSS, and BMC are exporting their locally made armored vehicles around the world. FNSS' exports to Malaysia in 2011 set a record for the Turkish defense industry of more than $600 million.</p><h4>How will the national main battle tank (MBT) Altay program help to encourage the development of the local defense industry?</h4><p>Phase I of the Altay project, involving prototype design, development, and qualification, was launched three years ago to fulfill the third-generation MBT requirement of the Turkish Land Forces. Within the scope of the project, all design, development, production, and test activities will be carried out in Turkey. The Altay tank will be a unique and indigenous platform, and the intellectual property rights of the Altay tank will belong to SSM. Otokar, the main contractor for the project, is responsible for system design, development, and the overall performance of the tank. In addition to the national armor system, the main electrical/electronic systems including the fire control system and 120 mm/55 caliber main gun system are being developed and manufactured respectively by Roketsan, ASELSAN, and MKEK. Currently, detailed design activities are ongoing and a mobility test rig (MTR) prototype is under production. Although Phase I is only the design and development stage for the Altay Project, there are already more than 40 local companies involved. In the serial production phase (Phase II) the number of local industries that will participate in the project will increase. Considering that MBTs are the most complex platforms among all land systems, and that the number of countries having the ability to produce their own MBT is very limited, the Altay project will boost local industries by bringing in new technology. For example, armor design, development, and test capabilities before the execution of the Altay Project were very limited. However, we now have a state-of-the-art National Ballistic Protection Center established in Roketsan's facilities. Considering the technical specifications of the Altay tank, it will be superior to its global rivals. Hence, by means of the features and technical and tactical performance of the Altay tank, local companies will enhance their ability to design, develop, and manufacture any type of military land vehicles. Consequently, the technology and know-how gained during the project can be dispersed to SMEs to guarantee permanent infrastructure for our MBTs. The serial production and manufacturing phase for 250 Altay tanks will commence five years after the successful completion of the design and prototype phase. In addition, it is aimed to strengthen Turkey's defense industry infrastructure by increasing local content and boosting local partners.</p><h4>Are we likely to see the further development of Turkey's warship building capabilities, and in what ship classes is Turkey looking to specialize in?</h4><p>In recent years, Turkey's naval shipbuilding industry has developed extensively and succeeded in producing fast boats, offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), corvettes, amphibious vessels, and auxiliary warships. Besides surface ships, new submarine production and design capabilities have been developed. The sustainability and development of these capabilities shall be the main objective of future strategies. Within these process, several systems and equipment such as command and control systems, fire control systems, and sonar have been developed by Turkish companies. Studies such as a national propulsion system have already commenced and the development of naval defense capabilities shall continue. Turkey has achieved internationally competitive capabilities and has exported fast boats and OPVs to several friendly countries. Furthermore, the MİLGEM class corvette has received strong interest from the international market. In line with international needs and the development of Turkey's naval shipbuilding industry, the country aims to specialize in frigate and submarines in the future as it has succeeded already in fast boats, OPVs, corvettes, amphibious vessels, and auxiliary ships.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of the current sovereign debt crisis in Europe, many are questioning Turkey's bid to join the EU. Does Turkey's future still lie in an economic and diplomatic union in Europe?</h4><p>It depends on how Turkish people perceive the EU. We see the EU project as “the grandest peace project in the history of mankind." When we go back to the main rationale behind the EU project, we see that it originated from the idea to build a peaceful relationship between nations at war for centuries. Therefore, it is inherently an inclusive, not exclusive project. Those who share the values enshrined in Article 49 in the Treaty on the EU can join the bloc. It is a value-oriented project and these values have derived from the shared experiences of humankind. When the EU project is described as such, there is no doubt that Turkey's future definitely lies in Europe. We belong to Europe. And why should we stay outside of it? Moreover, Turkey's EU membership process has tested in real terms the potential of Europe as a multicultural, peaceful, and economically prosperous union.</p><h4>Is Cyprus the biggest barrier to EU membership?</h4><p>At first glance, the Cyprus issue seems to be one of the biggest obstacles standing before Turkey's EU membership. Currently, only 13 chapters have been opened to negotiations, one of which was provisionally closed. Since the opening of the chapter on Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy under the Spanish Presidency in 2010, no new chapters could be opened. It is mostly argued that what can be labeled as a stalemate in Turkey-EU accession negotiations mostly stems from the Cyprus problem. At present, eight chapters are suspended due to the decision taken by the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on November 11, 2006 with regard to the implementation of the Additional Protocol. Due to the very same decision, the rest of the negotiation chapters cannot be closed even if all the technical harmonization procedures have been completed. The above-mentioned portrait reflects the Cyprus problem as the greatest barrier ahead of Turkey's EU membership. However, the truth is not always as it seems. Sometimes, realities are veiled behind superstitious covers. Indeed, if we were to perceive the EU as an actor working within the established rules and policies, we would have failed to notice the fact that a divided island was accepted to the bloc. Today, even EU officials admit that it was a big failure to grant the Greek Cypriot Administration membership at that time. As you might remember, through the “Annan Plan" prepared under the auspices of UN, a peaceful solution was targeted that would unite the island so as to enable both sides to have an equal say over their destiny. The idea was to make a united Cyprus a member of the EU, free of all its problems. However, the plan did not work out because of the unexpected “no" vote by the Greek Cypriots in the referendum held in April 2004. The reluctance of the Greek Cypriot side to reunify and its unwillingness to reach a resolution contributed to the continuation of the problem. Therefore, the Greek Cypriot Administration, which in essence was the real source of the puzzle that was placed on Turkey's table, was let in to join the EU together with all its unresolved problems. Just one week after the referendum, the Greek side was awarded with EU membership, whereas the Turkish Cypriots, who were striving for a solution, were left isolated outside the EU. Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus have always been the most vigorous supporters of peace on the island. As I have stated before, the results of the referendum on the Annan Plan clearly demonstrated to the international community that the Turkish side was in favor of a comprehensive settlement. The most serious aspect of the Cyprus problem is the unfair isolation and inhumane embargoes imposed on Northern Cyprus in all spheres of life and economic activity. We regard those unjust restrictions as more severe than the blockages ahead of our EU membership process. Therefore, we are calling upon all parties to lift all those restrictions on Northern Cyprus and expect the EU to adopt a fair stance on the Cyprus issue and Turkey's membership.</p><div class="quote">“It is clear that the EU needs Turkey as much as or even more than Turkey needs the EU."</div><h4>What will be the main issues under negotiation in 2012 and 2013?</h4><p>The years 2012 and 2013 will be ones in which Turkey will strive to unblock the deadlock in EU accession negotiations, as it has already taken the initial steps. Against all our efforts, the negotiation process is not proceeding as it ought to be. Even though the case for Turkey's membership is such a strong argument, the accession process has been facing resistance, particularly by certain member states, and 18 out of 22 chapters, which are pending to be opened, are blocked on political grounds. However, we are fully committed to the accession process, and for us 2012 and 2013 will be the years of striking reforms. EU membership is a strategic objective for Turkey and we are determined to continue the negotiations with the shared objective of full membership as is stated in our Negotiating Framework. Therefore, we continue our reform process patiently in every field of the acquis communautaire. In the last year alone, 14 primary and 150 secondary pieces of legislation have been enacted within the framework of the EU harmonization process. In this respect, our main objective is in raising the level of Turkey's alignment with the EU acquis to the upmost until the beginning of 2014. I would like to stress that, for some people, the EU Presidency of the Greek Cypriot Administration is one of the big issues for negotiations in 2012. However, for us it is not as we will not change our position. We will continue our relations with EU institutions and organs as usual.</p><h4>What progress has been made on the visa issue?</h4><p>The mobility of Turkish citizens in European countries has been adversely affected by the Schengen visa requirement. Turkey has recently become the only candidate country whose citizens still need to apply for a visa when visiting EU countries since the liberalization of visas for the citizens of Western Balkan nations in 2009 and 2010. Moreover, several third countries that have no interest in joining the EU are to benefit from the Schengen visa exemption. Visa procedures in practice prove to be too long and burdensome, so that even if Turkish citizens manage to get a visa in the end, their feeling of unfair treatment is consolidated during the process. The policy and attitude of EU countries are strengthening Turkish citizens' perceptions of being subject to double standards and their sense of alienation from the EU. Such policies are not conducive to create an environment of mutual understanding and willingness to build up a future together amongst the Turkish people and the European peoples. Various segments of Turkish society cannot make use of the opportunities presented by the accession process since the visa requirement functions as an obstacle, in particular for Turkish NGOs, universities, and youth in benefiting from EU funds and projects. Similarly, the visa requirement prevents the realization of the conditions for fair competition, which Turkish businessmen should enjoy within context of the Customs Union, giving, on the contrary, an unfair advantage to European businessmen. Turkey is a country with a long-standing relationship with the EU. Its citizens should not be subject to the EU visa procedures anymore in the light of the impressive as well as the stable economic growth and societal and political development of the country.</p><h4>What impact would visa liberalization have for the EU economy?</h4><p>Within the last decade Turkey has achieved stable economic growth, dynamism, and a well-functioning democracy. Thanks to our remarkable achievements in economy and increasing foreign trade volume, Turkey plays a prominent role in international organizations and has become more influential in the international arena. European countries, on the other hand, are faced with a severe economic crisis and consequently they would essentially be the ones who would benefit from the increased opportunities of visits by Turkish citizens either for economic or social purposes, including of course commercial visits. A mutually beneficial relationship between Turkey and the EU is a win-win situation for both sides. It is clear that the EU needs Turkey as much as or even more than Turkey needs the EU.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the GCC region for the global operations of General Motors (GM)?</h4><p>Extremely important. Considering GM's 100-year history and where we will be in the next century, emerging markets are the driver of growth in the automotive industry. Currently, over 60% of our sales are completed outside of North America, and going forward we seek to further strengthen our position in the Middle East. The Middle East is set to grow faster than most regions in the world over the next decade. We are forecasting that total industry vehicles sales in the Middle East will grow from about 1.15 million units in 2011 to 2.1 million units by the end of the decade—reflecting approximately 85% growth. This would make the Middle East one of the world's fastest growing automotive markets outside the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. This is due to the positive economic outlook for the region, particularly due to strengthening oil prices, and favorable demographics. Educational levels are increasing, the middle class is expanding, and about 60% of the population is under the age of 25. These elements are very beneficial for the automobile business. Many consumers are buying their first car, and a variety of others are upgrading to larger and more expensive vehicles. With our portfolio of brands and models, we are able to sell vehicles to meet all these needs and wants—from entry-level to luxury cars. GM's portfolio in the Middle East reflects that with Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac all positioned for growth. As an example of the importance we place on the Middle East, we had the world premiere of the all-new Chevrolet TrailBlazer SUV at the Dubai International Motor Show in November 2011—the first time that GM has globally unveiled a vehicle in the region. We also made a $70 million investment in our parts distribution center in Jebel Ali, Dubai, and recently refurbished our offices. We wouldn't be making these types of investments unless we viewed the Middle East as a growth engine for GM.</p><h4>What are the benefits of Dubai versus any other emirate or city in the region?</h4><p>We offer vehicles sourced from five different continents and our Parts Distribution Center, located in Jebel Ali, Dubai, stocks over 80,000 different parts sourced from more than 300 suppliers and distributed to 55 Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC facilities across the Middle East and a further 26 locations in Africa. We need a location that has world-class logistics and infrastructure—and there is no better place in the Middle East than Dubai. No city can match its shipping and logistics capacity. Furthermore, Dubai boasts the region's best health care and educational provision, and has a strong professional services sector, including finance, marketing, engineering, and sales, which all multinational companies require. Dubai is also a great place to attract top talent and retain those employees.</p><div class="quote">“We wouldn't be making these types of investments unless we viewed the Middle East as a growth engine for GM."</div><h4>How would you categorize the car market and automotive industry in the region?</h4><p>Across the globe there are economies experiencing peaks and troughs. I would classify the Middle East as a market that is stable. The overall automotive market registered only 1% growth in 2011. However, GM was able to outpace the market and register 13% vehicle sales growth in 2011. And, in January and February 2012, we registered a record sales performance. Much of this success can be attributed to the products that were launched over the past 18-24 months, such as the Chevrolet Sonic, which were well received in the marketplace.</p><h4>Where is your product revenue stream focused in terms of your three brands?</h4><p>The Middle East is not a homogenous market. Our portfolio of brands, which cover a wide range of products, allow us to meet the needs and wants of a variety of segments across the region. For example, in Lebanon, fuel-efficient and low-priced small and sub-compact vehicles are very popular. This is due to the local tax regulations and the price of fuel. Saudi Arabia, however, is known for its large families and the price of fuel is relatively inexpensive. Therefore, large cars and SUVs are very popular in the country, including our Chevy and GMC trucks. In Dubai, luxury vehicles are very popular and our Cadillac models, such as the CTS, CTS-V, SRX, and Escalade, are performing extremely well. We are able to meet the needs and demands of every consumer and market across the Middle East.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the $70 million investment GM made in its parts distribution center in Dubai?</h4><p>Our main strategy is to ensure we provide every Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac customer with a world-class shopping, buying, and ownership experience. The Parts Distribution Center plays a major role in delivering this promise. It is one of the most efficient facilities of its kind in the world, and it is fitted with the latest technology and IT systems. It stocks over 80,000 different parts and deals with more than 1 million parts orders every year to ensure all GM customers across the region can be supplied with any required vehicle part within 48 hours.</p><h4>How did the recent economic crisis impact your regional operations?</h4><p>It has actually helped us as we underwent some significant restructuring within the company. In the past, if the economy was booming we would invest heavily in the development of new products, but during a downturn we would pull back and decrease our investment in R&amp;D. Today, we have built a fortress-like balance sheet, which enables us to invest in designing and engineering new vehicles whether the world economy is in a boom or slump—ensuring that we will always be able to offer the very best vehicles in the marketplace. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest $7 billion to $8 billion a year in R&amp;D, design, and engineering to ensure that we can continue to launch great new products during different economic and business cycles. It all starts and ends with great products. And, I firmly believe that our ability to design, build, and sell the world's best vehicles is behind our success in the Middle East over the last few years. With six new products to be launched in 2012, we expect to continue the same momentum and growth this year. In the UAE, we closed the last quarter of 2011 up 20% in year-on-year terms. In the first two months of 2012 we added another 20% to our sales. This is due to having great products supported by great service.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the stable and dynamic aspects of the Islamic Republic of Iran's place in the fast-changing political and economic order of the world?<br></h4><p>Everyone knows that the land of Iran is the birthplace of a great civilization, having a historical background of over 7,000 years and being a civilization based on humane and divine values. Monotheism, respect for the rights of nations, and a rejection of the slavery and bondage of mankind are among the key features of Iranian civilization. After the coming of Islam, Iran's civilization, on the basis of Islamic culture and education, grew faster and experienced further expansion, achieving great ratings in the fields of monotheism and the belief in one God, literature and the arts, logic and philosophy, science and technology, mathematics and astrology, medicine, physics, chemistry, ethics, and human sciences, and it has introduced great scientists and provided many services to humanity as a whole.</p><p>During recent centuries, and especially over the course of the last century due to the consequences of aggression, war making, violations, and the avarice of oppressors, the forward movement of our nation encountered obstacles and hurdles. However, the cultural and intellectual foundation of our nation, through the endeavor and hard work of its wise and compassionate people, remained immune, leading the Iranian nation to the year 1357 (1978). In that year, under the leadership of Imam Khomeini, the monotheist, brave, wise man that lived a simple life and served the people, the Islamic Revolution in Iran began. The dictatorship, which through the support of the colonial powers, was overwhelming Iran, was toppled, and independence, freedom, and a governing system based on the votes of the people and the principles of Islam was established in our country.</p><div class="quote">“Everyone knows that the land of Iran is the birthplace of a great civilization."</div><p>Despite confronting international avarice, the eight-year Imposed War, threats, and unlawful sanctions, the Iranian nation proudly flies the flag of dignity, independence, and progress, and has bravely resisted all aggressions and disagreements and is removing all barriers in its way.</p><p>The nation of Iran looks for peace, justice, dignity, and advancement for all nations. It respects all human beings and propagates love, affection, and friendship.</p><p>Fortunately, the Islamic Republic of Iran has friendly and brotherly relations with all the nations and governments of the world, always insisting on the enhancement of relations based on justice, mutual respect, friendliness, and brotherhood, while standing firm against international avarice and expansionism and confronting aggression, occupation, and those who choose to deny the rights of nations.</p><p>Today, the nations of the world, and a majority of their governments, support the fair, just, and humanitarian stances of the Islamic Republic of Iran and see themselves on the side of the Iranian nation. This context is an advantageous opportunity to pave the way for the development and advancement of all nations through cooperation and concerted action.</p><h4>Could you explain Iran's growing ties with the economies of Asia and the Pacific and the importance of these increasingly privileged relationships for the Iranian economy?</h4><p>We, as an Asian country, belong to the Asian civilization, which is the root of human civilization. Our destinies are interlocked. The development of each of us means the development of the others, and if any harm comes to any of us, the others suffer as well. There are numerous reasons why Asian countries should stay together. None of us are expansionist, avaricious, or greedy. Our cultures share values such as humanity, love, affection, justice, and brotherhood. All of us confront insecurity, war, and terrorism. Over the course of recent years, it was made clear that the international economic system is not based on justice, and revolves around the benefits that some certain capitalistic countries derive. It is not only incapable of serving the economic interests of the nations, but also causes the spilling over of crises from high-risk countries and their shaky capitalistic systems to our countries. This bitter and costly experience proves that we should depend on ourselves and look to each other more than before.</p><p>Mutual, multilateral, and regional cooperation may play a key role in dynamic economic growth, bringing security and stability to countries.</p><p>For the time being, the Islamic Republic of Iran's relations with the countries of Central Asia, our neighbors, and those countries located in east and southeast Asia as well as plenty of other Asian countries, bilaterally, multilaterally, or through organizations such as ECO and COMCEC, are strong, and developing. Trade, technology transfer, the financing of industrial, agricultural, and energy projects, the implementation of joint touristic projects and so on are among the economic benefits that these relations deliver to us.</p><h4>What has been the impact of changing political relations with the EU—a key trading partner—on EU-Iran economic relations?</h4><p>Iran's foreign policy is based on the principles of justice, friendship, mutual respect, and the maintenance of human dignity. The relations of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the governments who apply these principles shall be robust and good. The experience of the recent decades shows that, unfortunately, some European governments, under the influence of the international oppressors, with the Zionist regime at the top of them, are not allowed to establish fair and friendly relations.</p><p>Of course, the unfair behavior of some Europeans shall be to the detriment of themselves. They think the world is limited to Europe. The world is much bigger than the mentality and ideas of some. Although the market share of European companies in Iran has increased in the current year, in comparison to the rapid growth of Iran's foreign trade, it is declining and Asian countries are quickly replacing them. Europe's share in Iran's oil exports remains fixed, while in the non-oil sector Asian countries, especially our neighbors, have surpassed countries such as Germany and Italy. In the imports sector, the UAE, China, and South Korea have enhanced their ranking when compared to Europe in their levels of foreign trade with Iran.</p><p>At present, many American and European companies struggle to get around the obstacles and sanctions to work with the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the performance of the Iranian economy under your direction, the domestic and international factors influencing this performance, and your assessment of the path ahead?</h4><p>To improve the efficiency of the Iranian economy, there are transformations and reforms underway in seven fields within the framework of the General Policies of the System and the Twenty-Year Vision. The consequences of such transformations include the establishment of more justice in the distribution of resources; the growth of talents and capabilities; further price transparency; the greater participation of the people and private sector, whether domestic or foreign, in the economy; the prevention of resource waste; a smaller bureaucracy; and enhancing competitiveness and the like.</p><p>The reforms underway include those of the tax system, the improvement of the banking system, goods distribution channels, the customs system, the national currency value, the subsidy system, and productivity.</p><p>The first step in targeting subsidies was successfully taken and the management and strength of the Iranian nation was well demonstrated during this great effort. Our experience in targeting subsidies is an outstanding achievement that can be an example to other countries. This act was conducted while Iran was under the heaviest of international sanctions. This matter is proof that the impact of sanctions on Iran's economy is trifling. The second is that Iran's system has the highest level of stability and strength, and enjoys the support of the people as it continues its advancement and progress.</p><h4>How do you see Vision 2025 and other related policies creating a more efficient Iranian economy?</h4><p>Through diversification in production, transition to a global economy, privatization, and reorganization of the capital markets Iran is vastly improving its productivity.</p><p>A portion of the resources originating from making the prices of energy carriers real shall be allocated to producers in different sectors in the form of concessional loans or government grants in order to raise productivity. Market competitiveness shall become more transparent and the investments made by domestic or foreign investors in projects shall be streamlined. Today, Iran's capital markets are among the most prosperous and successful securities and exchange markets in the world. The indexes have improved dramatically and no sign of economic crisis or the crises of the world securities and exchange markets can be seen in the Iran securities and exchange markets, providing a good opportunity for foreign investors and clients to do business in this market. The securities market for oil products and petrochemicals is already active, and soon the securities and exchange mechanism for the oil market will be brought into operation.</p><p>The absence of some foreign investors resulted in $50 billion worth of gas production projects in the southern part of Iran being awarded to domestic contractors. The volume of investment in energy projects is ramping up, while in other sectors of the industry some other projects are ready to be awarded to investors and contractors. The Twenty-Year Vision Document is a milestone on the road to achieving broader horizons, and it is of course based on justice and the respect of the rights of nations in international relations. As I said before, at present international relations are to the detriment of nations, increasing poverty and widening the gap between affluent and impoverished countries. The relations of international institutions and financial organizations need to undergo fundamental changes, while institutions such as the US Federal Reserve, which empty the pockets of nations through the issuance of unregulated paper assets, need to be restricted in their actions. Regional convergence, defining new Asian shared values, making transactions through national currencies, enhancing banking and monetary relations, and eliminating the US dollar as a means of transaction could be a big help in implementing fundamental changes in the international economic system and in enhancing domestic and regional economies.</p><h4>Which sectors and areas have been most affected by international sanctions, and what measures have been taken to alleviate the impact of the sanctions regime?</h4><p>The literature of sanctions belongs 30 years in the past. The period when the Americans regarded themselves as masters of the world has passed. We have plenty of opportunities available. We advised them not to implement such sanctions, and if they continue we will create new independent relations in the world. Even now there are many nations and governments who are interested in the establishment of relations independent of the great powers, and this will happen. We maintained our high economic growth over the course of the last year, when we were under sanctions, and growth will occur this year too. These things make nations more determined, and provide new chances for the success of our nation. There is a characteristic of the Iranian nation that, if not unique then at least uncommon, and that is its ability to turn threats into opportunities. The Iranian nation takes the most severe threats and then through its civilizational and cultural mechanisms changes them into tremendous opportunities. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been under the sanctions of its enemies for the last 32 years, and the sanctions have not had any influence on the will and determination of the Iranian nation. The people of Iran reached new peaks of progress and advancement during the sanctions, conquering new peaks of knowledge. The sanctions taught the Iranian nation to rely on its own resources and capacities more than ever before, the results of which have been seen in different scientific, research, and industrial achievements. Other countries can benefit from these advances as well. Meanwhile, foreign investment has experienced impressive growth. The only impact of sanctions was on increasing solidarity and expediting our growth rate.</p><h4>How do you interpret the role of foreign investment in fostering change and increasing the performance of the Iranian economy?</h4><p>Foreign investment has played, and continues to play a key role in the country's Fourth and Fifth Five-Year Development Plans (FYDPs). Regarding the target of 8% economic growth, the role of foreign investment shall especially be taken into consideration. Based on the existing laws, the treatment of foreign investors shall be the same as for domestic investors and no discrimination will apply; their security is also guaranteed. Fortunately, the growth rate of foreign investment in Iran, when compared to other countries, is at the highest of levels.</p><h4>How is Iran moving to produce a young, forward-looking nation? What reforms do you consider necessary to develop the nation's human capital and increase the collaboration between the worlds of academia and business?</h4><p>The youth of a nation is key to the development of its innovativeness, freshness, and creativity. In addition, the middle-aged and elderly have also taken deep and unique steps. The Islamic Revolution was a result of the faith, hard work, and creativity of our youth. The same goes for our victory in the holy defense, which in the eyes of all the politicians of the world was something unachievable. Another miracle of youth is currently underway. Our nation, in order to achieve its worthy position in the world and in the scientific, technical, and cultural relations of the globe, needs the innovative, productive, and courageous presence of the youth, and this is being realized.</p><p>The government is being decisive in its support of the endeavors of the youth to foster their talent and abilities for the development of the country. The enhancement of universities and research institutes, creating appropriate opportunities in all scientific, research, and technical fields, providing easy financial resources, and encouraging innovative and creative young people are among the measures being taken. The worthy achievements of Iran in different industries, such as oil and gas, nuclear energy, aerospace, and so on is indebted to the youth of this land, and this journey will continue.</p><h4>How do you see the future of Iran as “the economic, scientific, and technological leader of Southwest Asia" as stated in the Vision 2025 development plan?</h4><p>In the vision for the year 1404 (2025), Iran, based on its culture, science, and spirituality, should stand first in the region in all economic, cultural, scientific, and political aspects. The government and nation of Iran are moving in the same direction and great scientific, industrial, and political advances are happening fast. The Islamic Republic of Iran, relying on its civilization and cultural foundations, notwithstanding the contradictions and preventive acts of arrogant exploiters, can compensate for its previously imposed backwardness very quickly. The victory of the Islamic Revolution, and the faith, resistance, insight, and purity of the Iranian nation has provided it with an exceptional opportunity. In a time that the big powers of both the East and West have reached the end of the line and global relations are at the threshold of a great transformation, the Iranian nation will continue its route of advancement, and physical and spiritual progress through its best endeavors.</p><p>The current period is a new chapter in the life of the Iranian nation. The Iranian nation has always been the standard bearer of peace, brotherhood, love, and affection, wishing prosperity, peace, security, and friendliness to all. Regarding the general move of the world towards justice, purity, love, and affection, there is the growing hope that cruelty, aggression, poverty, discrimination, and enmity will come to an end, being replaced by justice, purity, and affection all over the world, and that all peoples will be able to enjoy the rulership of righteous and divine governments.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the latest World Investment Report, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Iran has increased from $1.5 billion in 2008 to $3 billion. How would you explain this rise, especially considering the recent global economic downturn?<br></h4><p>Considering that the average worldwide FDI figure was down 37% in 2009, our increase in FDI is indeed exceptional. Most developing countries did not receive any eye-catching amounts of FDI. Iran was ranked sixth worldwide for inward FDI growth in 2009, with an 86% increase in the volume of FDI compared to 2008. Nevertheless, despite this significant growth I don't think that the volume of FDI in Iran corresponds to the rate of growth, the ongoing development of the Iranian economy, or the size of the national economy. In other words, $3 billion in FDI is not really a great figure for a country of our size with a GDP of more than $380 billion that is ranked as the world's 26th largest economy. There is still plenty of room for FDI growth.</p><h4>Do you think the rise in FDI is related to Iran's newly evolving private sector?</h4><p>Until recently Iran was a state-dominated economy. We are still at the starting point in our efforts to foster the private sector, and this is where the main players in the economy have the chance to shine. We need a strong private sector that has the strength, skill, and experience to be able to bargain and cut deals with foreign investors. The bargaining power of the country now comes from the private sector. The stronger the private sector, the better it will be able to bargain and interact in the global arena. If, for example, you look at foreign investment in Turkey, you will find that the growth of the Turkish economy coincided with privatization. Now you find that those huge Turkish firms that attracted foreign investment into Turkey have turned into investor companies in other countries. Turkey's exports in services alone have reached $100 billion. A few years ago it was less than $3 billion. So in short, the more companies learn to stand on their own feet, the bigger the responsibilities and roles they will be able to undertake.</p><div class="quote">“We also ensure that the capital account is open for foreign investors so they can repatriate their profits."</div><h4>What role has the government taken in the development of the private sector?</h4><p>When we first decided to privatize the economy we tried to find the key players and companies that could lead the way. The capacity of a country is not just its population and natural resources, but it also lies in the capacity of its business people. So as we continue to develop our private sector, I am sure we will play a more dynamic role in both the local and global economy. Our job is to provide the necessary incentives and economic stimulus to expedite the effective implementation of the privatization process and to facilitate private sector growth in Iran. We are required, for example, to give some soft, concession-like loans to the private sector. We are also required to take measures to avoid monopolization in the economy, and provide the right conditions for a competitive private sector. A “Competition Council" has been designated by the President to oversee this process. Furthermore, as per the law, the government agencies responsible for granting the licenses and permits required by the private sector are obliged to respond in written form to applicants in less than 10 days and issue the licenses and permits within one month from the date of receiving full documentation. If these time limits are violated, companies have the right to file a complaint against the state agencies involved. We at OIETAI and in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance are in charge of following up these issues. In the past, we didn't have these kinds of measures and mechanisms at all.</p><h4>Have you found yourself having to intervene to move the privatization process forward?</h4><p>Yes, we have, because state bodies and organizations have to know that from now on the private sector is the center of attention and they must adjust their activities accordingly. For example, we actually reviewed the complaints against some deputy ministers. It was very unusual that a state body would put the private sector before another state organization and take sides against them and in favor of the private sector. The deputy minister had to answer for his negligence in that instance, and we believe that these measures will help change the general mindset in Iran as the private sector continues to grow and strengthen.</p><h4>What do you think are your responsibilities and duties to the private sector?</h4><p>We need to deliver some messages to the private sector. Firstly, private sector representatives must not only know but also be sure that whatever they need—be it licenses or permits or the like—they can get it, and get it quickly. Secondly, they should know that the red tape is being cut and that the legal and bureaucratic procedures are becoming less and less time-consuming. Thirdly, they must know that we are doing all we can to reduce costs and facilitate the paper work for any company that wants to go into manufacturing or set up a production facility. In short, our responsibility is to help foster, facilitate, and provide a business environment in which the private sector can grow unhindered. Our World Bank rating has improved greatly in the last two years, and our aim is to improve on that.</p><h4>What about the issue of subsidies in Iran? How does the heavy subsidization of the economy affect the development of the private sector?</h4><p>We aim to target subsidies as this is a major issue. Our previous state-centered economy granted a lot of subsidies. In fact, the annual subsidies equal our entire revenue from oil exports every year. So there are two aims to targeting subsidies: firstly, that the subsidies should go only to those who need them the most, i.e. the deprived, the poor, and the needy; and secondly, that resources are freed up so the government can spend them only when necessary and according to its priorities.</p><p>We must also consider the huge gap between supply and demand in the Iranian economy. Our manufacturing industry is not large enough, so that once a new product is introduced into the market there arises huge demand that cannot be satisfied. That's why foreign investors can make a huge profit in Iran to an extent that is incomparable to virtually any other country in the world. There are many examples of foreign investors that have made such levels of profit in Iran that those profits have fueled and paid for their expansion on the global market. These all go into answering why there was growth in FDI in Iran when there was such a large global downturn. That's also why I believe that $3 billion in FDI is a very small amount for Iran. I think, with some small amendments, we could easily increase that FDI figure to $30 billion a year.</p><h4>Besides legal and technical support, do you have more "hands-on" operations where you and your organization can interact with foreign investors?</h4><p>Yes, in fact we've made great strides in improving our administrative support infrastructure in Iran. After all, to transform the economy, administrative reforms are just as important as economic or legal reforms. For example, we have created Foreign Investment Services Centers in Tehran and in the capital cities of all our provinces. These operate as sort of one-stop shops, and they've been a great help to investors. The aim is to support investors through an entire project, from the very idea of the project right up to its physical realization. These centers do both before-care and after-care services. They are like mini-consultation bureaus and their task is to answer and find solutions to any problems that maybe encountered by foreign investors, even after the project is up and running. We also have two websites: www.investiniran.ir and Iran Investment Opportunities at www.iio.ir, which we launched about a year ago as a bridge between foreign investors and us. On the website you can choose the sector you're interested in and find out about the detailed profiles for the investment opportunities in that sector along with everything you need to know, from legal matters right down to the application form you need to fill out, and all of it is available online. The rules, laws, and regulations are available in 12 languages. This site has been a great help for us. It's been our link to the investor community. Up until now about 6,000 projects have been brought to us, of which we have selected around 600 that are now ready to be presented to foreign investors.</p><h4>Have you been able to get the word out on the global market about the investment opportunities in Iran?</h4><p>We have been working on marketing and also on developing bilateral negotiations with different countries. We hold seminars to introduce Iranian investment opportunities in at least 12 different countries each year. The most recent seminars were held in countries such as China, Qatar, India, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Portugal, and Turkey, and they were very successful. We also held a forum in Europe, and since that forum four missions have been sent to Iran.</p><h4>Has there been sufficient investment in infrastructure projects in Iran?</h4><p>Infrastructure projects are crucial in terms of attracting and developing foreign investment. Railways, road construction, airways, metros and subways, public transport, power plants, dams, the food industry, telecommunications... all of these sectors have up until now relied solely on the state budget. FDI in these kinds of infrastructural projects has not been significant, unfortunately. This is where we want to bring FDI in. We plan on using the PPP (public-private partnership) model, which we've been promoting in various forums. We offer PPP training for relevant managers and directors, and they've responded very well. If we can undertake these infrastructural projects within the appropriate financial model, I believe we can increase foreign investment in Iran tenfold. But because domestic administrations don't have the requisite experience, the transition hasn't occurred. Until now all government executing agencies simply rely on the state budget or foreign debt financing, but we want to convert that reliance on debt to FDI in these projects so that they become more economically feasible.</p><h4>Which PPP model will you apply in Iran?</h4><p>It depends on the type of project. For example, power plants are mostly done through BOT (build-operate-transfer), or BLT (build-lease-transfer) models. Others are done through BOO (build-own-operate) models or some advanced contractual agreements. Sometimes we need to be innovative and create unique models. I'll give you an example: Imagine we have a dam construction project that requires an investment of $100 million. In the past there were two ways to do it, either by allocating a budget and paying for the project step by step, or through financing. But in the financing model, the financial institutions that finance the project make more profit than the host country. Now, however, we break that $100 million into separate parts, so that, say, $20 million comes from the private sector, $30 million may come from the government as a subordinate concession loan, $20 million could be contributed by our commercial banks, and the remaining $30 million can be contributed by local partner companies. This model frees the government of $70 million in resources—70% of the project's cost. So the government can then finance three other projects with the same money it would have needed for just one project. Also, with private involvement, efficiency and productivity increases, and the project is completed on time.</p><h4>When you receive a foreign investment application, what criteria do you consider to provide it with FIPPA (the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act) status?</h4><p>I believe the law we instituted in 2002 concerning this subject is one of the smoothest and most advanced laws in the world. According to it, foreign investors can be involved in all sectors that the Iranian private sector is involved in. Secondly, all privileges and advantages granted to the domestic private sector are also granted to foreign investors with no discrimination. A third criterion is that there is no limitation on the size of the investment and that a project can be 100% foreign-owned. Our recommendation is that foreign investors have links with the domestic private sector, but we don't insist on this. However, in the model we're going to apply, we believe there must be some kind of concession to foreign investors involved in joint ventures with local private sector firms. We haven't prepared these incentives yet, but we are working on them. We are also working on incentives that will make joint projects with local companies a more attractive option compared with 100% owned by foreign investors, the reason being that this would facilitate technology transfer into Iran.</p><p>On top of those criteria, we also ensure that the capital account is open for foreign investors so they can repatriate their profits. So, for example, if in a time of crisis the government tries to limit a company's capital account, it could not do so for foreign investors. Another criteria is that there are no limits on imports or exports. This means that once we issue a license to a foreign investor, they don't need any other licenses to be able to import or export. Additionally, any Iranian living overseas who invests in Iran can do so under the status of a foreign investor. So, as you can see, foreign investors get a very good deal in Iran, something Iranian companies complain to us about because sometimes they don't receive the same privileges.</p><h4>How about the tax system? Have you made changes there too?</h4><p>Yes, we have amended the previously complicated and ambiguous tax system. The corporate income tax is a flat rate of 25%, though in some sectors we grant further incentives and exemptions. In the manufacturing sector, for example, foreign investors have a tax exemption on 80% of their income for the first four years. So if the company's balance sheet showed that it had incurred a loss in those first four years, it is exempted from tax. For those investing in less developed areas of the country, the tax exemption goes up to 100% of corporate income. In free zones, 100% of income is exempt from tax for 20 years. The agricultural sector is permanently exempt from tax. In tourism 50% of income is tax-exempted, while in exports it is 100%. As for customs, all new imported machinery is exempt from customs duties. Raw materials are also exempt from duty, if they are to be utilized for exported products.</p><h4>Why have all these government initiatives for developing the Iranian private sector taken place in the last two years? Why 2008?</h4><p>First of all, a state-owned economy does not attract FDI. You cannot take off and fly when you are heavy. You have to lighten your load. Although there is a privatization effort in Iran, we are not moving toward a liberal economy, and there is no place for speculation here. We issue bonds, but they are Islamic bonds, or sukuk, which don't create any speculative crises because they are paid out in real assets. So although we are moving toward privatization, we are not moving in a direction that would allow for capital accumulation. For a long time there was no consensus in Iran on how the privatization of the economy could work. It took years for us to reach consensus, and it was only by 2008 that it became law. This kind of transition isn't unique to Iran; we are seeing it all around the world.</p><h4>What does the near future hold for the Iranian economy?</h4><p>Iran is a unique economy. We have a very diverse agricultural sector, with the fourth most diverse agricultural production in the world. We have one of the most advanced petroleum industries, the second-largest gas reserves, and are the fourth-largest producer of oil in the world. There are amazing historical treasures. Iran stands among the industrial powers of the region with its reserves of commodities such as zinc, cobalt, and manganese, that makes us fourth to ninth in the world for these mineral reserves. On top of that, we have one of the most educated and low-cost labor forces in the world.</p><p>You cannot find this kind of potential and wealth of both human and natural resources anywhere else in the world. So half the job is already done. We now have to accomplish the remaining half. In terms of developing foreign economic cooperation, our primary focus is on regional cooperation, even though we are open to all foreign cooperation, be it from Latin America, China, or elsewhere. But our first focus is the region we live in. If regional neighbors need access to our energy resources, then our priority is to those neighbors. Our objective overall is stability and security for the region, because that means stability and security for us as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you list some of the major reforms undertaken by the ministry to overcome inflation and the state budget deficit?<br></h4><p>Preventing the growth of inflation and reducing the general level of prices are among the main objectives and efforts of economic decision makers. Our financial and monetary policies have been centered around directing cash flow to the manufacturing sector as well as taking regulatory monetary policies to control inflation arising from demand pressure. The consequences of these policies have been reflected in the fall of inflation in 1388 (starting March 21, 2009)—following an inflationary rise in 1387 (2008)—in which we saw inflation drop to 10.8% by the end of that year.</p><p>On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, in coordination with other relevant bodies, by taking the appropriate measures to curb inflation with an emphasis on the field of distributing goods, endeavored to minimize the impact of inflation on vulnerable and lower income groups.</p><p>In terms of budget management, predicting new sources and endeavoring to realize predicted sources, on the one hand, and enhancing productivity and the efficiency of credit allocation through improving public expenses management and the need to enhance government financial and budgetary discipline, on the other, are among the main pillars that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance has taken into account in recent years. The main actions taken have included:</p><div class="quote">“Given the role and importance of the private sector in economic development, the enhancement and strengthening of the private sector has drawn the attention of policy makers."</div><p>1 Reducing the government's non-sovereign role: Among the executive approaches for boosting the efficiency of government expenses, the government's non-sovereign role in ministries and state-owned firms has been reduced. This is a policy that, in line with Article 44 of the Constitution, has been expedited in recent years.</p><p>2 Compiling and implementing the Economic Transformation Plan with an emphasis on managing expenses: One of the Ministry's plans to restructure the country's economy is to draw up and implement schemes concerning the seven pillars of the Economic Transformation Plan, including rectifying the subsidy system, the taxation system, the productivity system, the banking system, the customs administration, the distribution of goods and services, and the money valuating regime. The rectifying approaches of some of the above, especially in enhancing the productivity and subsidy systems, are contingent upon public sector expenses management. In that connection, targeting subsidies has emerged as the overarching pillar of the Economic Transformation Plan for implementing fundamental reforms in the country's economic infrastructure, designed and implemented for expediting the realization of the country's 20-Year Vision and rectifying different economic sectors.</p><h4>What is the current status of energy price reform?</h4><p>Energy is one of the key factors for development and a main element of production. Regarding the price of energy carriers in the domestic market, the gap between the energy consumption ratio in Iran with developed countries, inequity in the payment of state subsidies, fossil fuel limitations, the considerable annual growth in the consumption of energy carriers, the technical and economic inefficiency of energy consumption, and problems related to the environment, it is now necessary to regard optimal energy consumption as a necessity. The studies made and experience gained shows that overcoming this problem without implementing price policies will not achieve the desired results, so in order to resolve these problems, such as organizing energy carrier consumption and targeting subsidy payments, the “Plan for Targeting Subsidies" was prepared and the “Law on Targeting Subsidies" was ratified by Parliament on January 13, 2009.  Based on Article 1 of this law, the state is required to set the prices of energy sources (gas oil, fuel oil, kerosene, liquid gas, and other oil derivatives), with regard to the quality of carriers and the costs borne (including transportation, distribution, taxation, and legal duties and charges), in a way that they gradually reach at least 90% of f.o.b. prices for the Persian Gulf by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP) in 2014. Hence, with regard to the programs established by the government, energy prices shall become more reasonable in the course of the next five years. In Articles 7, 8, and 11 of the law and its implementing regulation, the necessary measures for any possible consequences have been foreseen and it is expected that minimum negative impacts will arise because of the law's enforcement.</p><p>The main advantages of amending energy prices include:</p><p>•Amending the technological structure of manufacturing units, aiming at improved energy efficiency,</p><p>•Reducing the level and ratio of energy consumption,</p><p>•Preparing appropriate grounds to attract investment in the energy production sector,</p><p>•Developing renewable energy sources,</p><p>•Mitigating the rent and smuggling of energy sources,</p><p>•Mitigating polluters and preventing the pollution of the environment,</p><p>•Improving the possibility of accurately assessing economic activities and investments, and</p><p>•Preparing the way for Iran to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p><h4>What are the root causes of unemployment in Iran, especially among the young, and what policies are being employed to mobilize Iran's human capital?</h4><p>Economic indicators from 1375 (1996) onwards show the emergence of a structural transformation in the combination of working age job seekers due to the rapid population growth experienced in the early years after the magnificent Islamic Revolution. The results of this structural change are reflected in the increased pressure on labor force supply. The average annual supply of new labor over the course of the last decade has been about two folds that of annual labor force demand. In addition to the large working age population, the growing numbers of university graduates and women entering the workforce intensified pressure on labor supply factors. On the demand side, because of a reduction in the economy's unutilized capacity and the lingering of relatively low production growth, as well as the deviation of some capital toward non-productive economic activities, we faced an imbalance in the creation of stable productive jobs.</p><p>The country now enjoys a great potential for entrepreneurship. Iran's young well-educated labor force embodies this potential, and can become a strong point if they are trained with practical complementary courses.</p><p>Generally speaking, the basic criteria for policy making in the labor market can be summarized as follows:</p><p>•Improving the investment climate for private sector entrepreneurs,</p><p>•Improving the flexibility of laws, regulations and active bodies in the labor market, and</p><p>•Enhancing the country's educational and training system to match the needs of the labor market.</p><h4>How would you describe the changing composition of the economy, the ongoing privatization efforts and their impact, and the rising role of the private sector in the economy?</h4><p>Given the role and importance of the private sector in economic development, the enhancement and strengthening of the private sector has drawn the attention of policy makers in recent years. Removing the impediments to the development of the non-governmental sector centered around four key pillars: transforming the administrative system, organizing state firms, breaking monopolies, and decentralizing the functions of the state. It should be acknowledged that the notification of the general policies of Article 44 of the Constitution and then compiling the law on implementing the aforementioned policies had crucial importance on preparing the ground to speed up the transference of the government's non-sovereign functions to the private sector. As mentioned in Article 44, the government obtained the ability to divest itself from a large number of firms. With regard to the volume of divestitures, the grand total between 1370 and 1388 (1992-2009) amounted to IR697,989 billion, IR 7,000 billion of which were made between 1383 and 1388 (2004-2009). The volume of divestiture in the said period was an outstanding record. In the same vein, a bill is being drafted that will offer huge incentives and facilities to non-governmental activities, which, in turn, may improve privatization indicators.</p><p>Concurrent with the divestitures, the other strategy of the government is to improve the business environment. In this regard and through the cooperation of the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI), some workgroups were established to enhance the ranking of Iran's Doing Business indicators. The administrative, legislative, and judicial powers intend to take practical steps to improve the business environment, and the actions taken in this regard have already improved the international ranking of the country.</p><h4>What has the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance done to promote and protect foreign investment in Iran?</h4><p>Providing financial resources and the appropriate technology for the management of macro-scale issues as well as the developmental and infrastructural sectors of the country are the main concerns of all countries, and especially of Iran. Although there are various methods for providing financial facilities, international experience shows that foreign investment is one of the best solutions suited for this purpose.</p><p>Pursuant to the importance of economic growth and development and the necessity for deeper global interaction in the post-war years, a consensus at the macro level regarding foreign investment was formed among the government and other authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the amendment of the structures and legal bases of foreign investment has captured their attention.</p><p>The execution and interpretation of the laws concerning these topics, such as the general policies of Article 44 of the Constitution, the preparation of the 20-Year Vision, as well as all rules and regulations concerning foreign investment in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA) and its Implementing Regulation, are among the key measures that have been taken.</p><p>The above-mentioned laws, in general, and the FIPPA, in particular, prepared the judicial and legal environment for foreign investment in Iran in a way that foreign investors can register 100% owned local companies and are allowed to repatriate the profits generated from their activities in the form of foreign currency or goods, following the observance of legal procedures as mentioned in their investment licenses. They also equally enjoy, according to FIPPA, all the rights, protections, and incentives granted to domestic investors. In addition, foreign investment is guaranteed against nationalization and expropriation. The other area available to foreign investors is in investing in the securities and exchange market, and some investors have already invested in the country's securities market.</p><p>Iran enjoys some unique characteristics. It borders 15 countries, enjoys an outstanding labor force that can meet the economic needs of the region with a population of 400 million, and with regard to oil, gas, and petrochemical products it is the economic hub of the region and is at the same time blessed with strong domestic demand.</p><p>In 2009, the Iran Securities and Exchange Market experienced 60% growth and saw the divestiture of large companies sold within the framework of the privatization program, which exceeded $60 billion. All of this is an obvious sign of the dynamism of Iran's economy.</p><p>Iran, as a major producer and exporter of energy, can easily meet the energy needs of active manufacturers in the domestic market. Being located on the historic north-south and east-west transit routes, it is blessed with climatic diversity as well as having the appropriate infrastructure. Few places in the world can offer all these capacities. Taking all the above into consideration, the rate of return on investments in Iran, which is the most important criteria for investment, is remarkably higher than that for other countries.</p><p>The formation of the National Development Fund will provide new opportunities for private sector economic activities and foreign investors. Since it is based on the Articles of Association of the National Development Fund, foreign investors are entitled to use the resources of the fund for their investment projects in Iran.</p><p>Taking all the above into account, Iran is able to attract large volumes of foreign investment, such that the volume of FDI in 1388 (2009) amounted to $3 billion, reflecting 86% annual growth. It is also predicted that by the end of the Fifth FYDP, foreign investment will exceed $12 billion.</p><p>Following the approval of the Law on the Admission of Foreign Banks, a chain of actions has been taken by the authorities to devolve the developmental role to players in the economy. The presence of these banks facilitates the access of economic firms to new and various resources, increasing their choices and options.</p><p>In addition, the admission of foreign banks into the country shall create a competitive environment and increase managerial capacities. It is also a positive sign for the domestic and foreign private sectors to prepare and plan their financial models with confidence regarding the availability of financial resources.</p><p>As a result of the efforts made, in recent years Iran has succeeded in joining the group of countries that have high standards of human development. With regard to human development indicators, Iran has improved, reflecting the enhancement of human development over the course of recent years. The Islamic Republic of Iran rose 18 places among the 194 countries measured, and took 70th place and for the first time it was listed among those countries possessing highly developed human resources.</p><h4>What is the status of the foreign trade regime of Iran and the reforms undertaken in this area?</h4><p>During recent years, Iran's economy experienced considerable growth in the trade sector and in non-oil exports as well as in imports, notwithstanding the global economic crisis. Considering the approach of the 20-Year Vision, Iran's economy underscores its interactions with the world as a strategic objective, with an emphasis on regionalism.</p><p>Nevertheless, since export promotion is tightly linked with trade liberalization, during recent years some widespread and outstanding measures were taken to improve foreign trade, including the removal of non-tariff barriers, concluding preferential trade agreements with countries of the region, creating free trade zones, consolidating duties, and preparing the legal grounds for the participation of foreign investors in the real and financial sector.</p><p>Facilitating trade and enhancing export trends resulted in the improved performance of non-oil exports, which exceeded the goals set. Non-oil exports in the Fourth FYDP (1384-1388) (2005-2009) were 50% higher than the objectives laid out in the program. The growth of non-oil exports, despite the global financial crisis, reflects the success of the trade policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p><p>In addition to the above, the country's great potentials, the diversity of its products and manufacturing, and the variety of its trading partners have made it possible that by changing the combination of exportable goods and trade partners and also moving from conventional trade and target markets in the West toward new markets in the East for foreign trade to remain immune of the undesirable impacts of foreign bottlenecks. During the years of the Fourth FYDP, imports into the country, under the influence of exports, rose.</p><p>With a population of more than 74 million people and growing needs, Iran is one of the biggest markets in the region and enjoys a great capacity to expand trade relations with countries in its region and around the world. Regarding the type of imports, the bulk of imported goods are intermediate and capital goods, and these make up 81% of all imports, while the contribution of intermediate goods is 66%. Hence, concerning the kind of manufactured goods in countries of the region, there are many grounds to expand trade relations.</p><p>From this view, the events that occurred in the world trade arena, despite the limitations imposed on industrialized countries, have created considerable grounds for the development of regional cooperation and investment by developing countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures have been taken by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to improve its supervision over the increased number of private banks active in the Iranian finance sector?<br></h4><p>Effective banking supervision is among the major prerequisites for a sound economic system, as well as the stability of the financial system, and the building of confidence in this system by reducing the risks faced by depositors and other creditors. The CBI, according to the Monetary and Banking Law of Iran, approved in 1351 (1972/73), fulfills a supervisory function role, thereby ensuring the sound operation of banks and credit institutions as well as the presence of sufficient capital and reserves to counter risks. Thus, the CBI has moved from “supervision compliance" to “risk-based supervision". In this regard, the CBI adopted the following measures: restructuring the banking supervision section, formulating prudential regulations, and broadening and expanding the new literature on banking supervision. Therefore, the CBI practices off-site supervision based on the review of the banks' financial position. As of 1389 (2010/11), the CBI has strengthened its supervisory mechanisms to prepare the ground for on-site supervision, including provincial supervision and inspection by local staff, and to pay more attention to off-site supervision through a careful consideration of prudential ratios.</p><p>Therefore, the Money and Credit Council (MCC) set the minimum required capital for the establishment of banks at IR4 trillion, for credit institutions at IR3,500 billion, and for electronic banks at IR2 trillion. Banks and credit institutions that violate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) limits will be downgraded and face restrictions.</p><div class="quote">“The CBI aims at curbing broad money growth, with an emphasis on controlling monetary base growth."</div><p>At present, the priorities of the supervision section of the CBI for the current year are: preventing the operation of unorganized money market institutions not licensed by the CBI; putting a deposit insurance system into effect; and expanding banking operations in free trade zones.</p><p>One of the major banks' assessments in Iran, as in other countries, is the CAR. The MCC approved a bylaw on capital adequacy in 1382 (2003/04). Based on Article 3 of this bylaw, the minimum CAR for banks and credit institutions was determined at 8% with the stipulation that the CBI could change this ratio for all or some of the banks as need arose.</p><p>Moreover, the development of a fair competitive environment, the prevention of banking and credit overexposure, improved financial transparency, and the higher use of IT in the banking system are underlined in Chapter 4 of the Supervisory Policy Package of the Banking System in 1389 (2010/11), approved by the MCC.</p><h4>What results do you expect to see from the recent regulation lifting the restriction on foreign investment in Iranian banks?</h4><p>Banks enjoy a high share in the Iranian financial market. Moreover, there are many investment projects in Iran as a developing country in which credits are largely financed through the banking system, creating lots of opportunities for banks to make profits. Certainly, lifting the restrictions on foreign investment in the Iranian banking industry may raise the amount of capital inflows to banks.</p><h4>Iran is unique in the world with its fully sharia-compliant financial market. It is estimated that the potential of sharia-compliant assets reaches up to $4 trillion globally. What actions are being taken by the CBI to improve the potential of this market?</h4><p>In light of the soaring oil prices in recent years and investors' reluctance to put money into Western financial institutions, there is an increased willingness to deposit with Islamic banks in the region. This is mainly due to higher confidence in the system and the higher deposit rates offered by Islamic banks. Thus, with regard to the huge potential of the Islamic financial market comprising Islamic banking, Islamic insurance, Islamic bonds, and Islamic investment funds, the expansion of this market is expected in the future.</p><p>The Islamic Banking Sharia Council was established at the CBI in 1388 (2009/10), and it discusses various issues including guidelines for risk coverage arising from exchange rate fluctuations, sharia procedures for the issuance of bonds in foreign currencies, guidelines for the issuance of foreign exchange certificates of deposit, rules on entering into “debt purchase contracts" and “debt repurchase contracts", designing new instruments for the development of the interbank market, and planning for the approval of sharia-compliant procedures for other types of sukuk. The Islamic Banking Sharia Council tries to resolve sharia concerns, and paves the way in designing new Islamic financial instruments.</p><p>The formulation, approval, and declaration of the Law for the Development of New Financial Instruments and Institutions was a major step forward in the expansion of the Iranian capital market. Therefore, the High Council of Securities and Exchange took the issue of financial instruments, i.e. sharia-based instruments, into consideration. The introduction of new financial instruments, namely sukuk, and participation papers  issued by the government, municipalities, and investment funds that are transferable on the stock exchange help evolve the capital market and create new opportunities for expanding this market. At present, shares, rights, and corporations' participation papers are being traded on the capital market. It is expected that the shares of funds will be traded on the stock exchange in the future. Then, it is the turn of debt instruments, in particular sukuk, which would provide a good opportunity for the expansion of the capital market.</p><h4>Why did Iran need a new Anti-Money Laundering Law and how is the CBI now authorized to curb illegal money laundering activities?</h4><p>The Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Law was approved by the Parliament in January 2008, and it includes 12 chapters. Upon ratification of this law, the pertinent executive bylaw, comprising 49 articles, was approved and declared in December 2009. According to this bylaw, the CBI, as the supervisory body for banks and credit institutions, shall ensure the proper implementation of the AML's provisions and the pertinent bylaws for banks and credit institutions.</p><p>Thus, based on the road map prepared by the Anti-Money Laundering High Council (consisting of the Minister of Commerce, Minister of Intelligence, Minister of the Interior, and the CBI Governor), 11 instructions were prepared by the CBI. The Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance presides over the High Council. The CBI issues the AML-related instructions and circulars, and supervises their proper implementation.</p><h4>The CBI recently adjusted the reserve ratios for the banks. Was this part of an attempt to ease the supply of credit to the private sector?</h4><p>The CBI reduced the reserve requirement ratios of banks to raise the share of banks' long-term deposits and strengthen the sustainability of bank deposits. The free reserves of banks, after lowering the reserve requirements, will be used in priority order for the payment of bank debt to the CBI, financing the working capital of productive units and incomplete projects, investment for productive units, interbank loans, and the Mehr Housing Project. On the other hand, the reduction in the reserve requirement ratios increases the money multiplier (considering other variables remain constant) in line with CBI policy on controlling and restricting monetary base growth as well as raising the money multiplier.</p><h4>What is the current policy of the CBI regarding inflation? What monetary policy actions need to be taken to sustain the decreasing inflation rate trend?</h4><p>The CBI aims at curbing broad money growth, with an emphasis on controlling monetary base growth. Banks' indebtedness to the CBI as a component of monetary base growth, which surged in 1386 (2007/08), decreased through controlling measures adopted by the CBI such as setting the 34% penalty of overdraft facilities on central bank reserves, and banks' obligation to extend loans commensurate with their accessible funds. Thus, the continued rise in banks' indebtedness to the CBI was reduced in 1387 (2008/09), followed by a further decrease in banks' outstanding debts to the CBI in 1388 (2009/10). This reduction in line with directing banking facilities to priority sectors helped prevent obstacles to financing the real sector.</p><p>Other CBI measures, besides controlling the monetary base, include curbing inflationary expectations as well as adopting effective and efficient supervision over banking operations to extend facilities for their true purposes and prevent the involvement of banks' facilities in speculative activities, all of which play a key role in curbing inflation. Moreover, the CBI may utilize participation papers to reduce monetary base growth if necessary.</p><h4>How would you assess the confidence of the public in the banking system? Does Iran need a deposit insurance system to encourage higher saving ratios in the banking system?</h4><p>At present, the banks enjoy public trust due to their performance in previous years. Of particular note is that despite such events as the Revolution and the Imposed War, Iranians have never faced any difficulties in withdrawing their deposits from the banking system.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the deposit insurance system is underlined in the Law for Usury (Interest) Free Banking as well as Chapter 2 of the pertinent bylaw of the mentioned law. According to Article 4 of the Law for Usury (Interest) Free Banking, banks are obliged to pay the principal of Gharz-al-hasaneh (savings and current) deposits and may undertake and/or insure the principal of term investment deposits.</p><p>Banking deposits must be insured by an independent entity such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund. The deposit insurance system shall be implemented in cooperation with the money market supervisory body and all agent banks. Therefore, one chapter of the new Banking Law is devoted to the establishment, administration, financing and operation of the Deposit Guarantee Fund.</p><h4>What steps are being taken on the fiscal side to reduce government debt to more comfortable levels?</h4><p>In order to improve the government fiscal position during the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP) period, tax revenues and non-oil resources increased while expenditures decreased.</p><p>The highest change in tax revenues (excluding tax on oil performance) was related to 1388 (2009/10) and the lowest to 1384 (2005/06). Moreover, the biggest change in non-oil resources occurred in 1386 (2007/08) and 1388 (2009/10). On the other hand, during the Fourth FYDP, growth in government expenses remained relatively unchanged. Government expenses for the years 1386 (2007/08) and 1388 (2009/10) increased by merely 4.2% and 15.5%, respectively.</p><p>Moreover, according to Article 2 of the Fourth FYDP Law, and to establish fiscal and budgetary discipline during the course of the FYDP, the following measures were taken:</p><p>1 The government was obliged to increase the share of expenses financed through government non-oil revenues in a way that by the end of the plan government expenses could be financed entirely through tax and other non-oil revenues.</p><p>During the Fourth FYDP years, the share of expenses in non-oil resources constantly increased, except for the year 1387 (2008/09), with the highest share related to 1388 (2009/10) (the last year of the FYDP) by 76.3% and the lowest to 1384 (2005/06) (the first year of the FYDP) by 51.7%.</p><p>2 Based on Paragraph (b), Article 2, Fourth FYDP Law, financing the budget deficit through borrowing from the Central Bank and the banking system is prohibited. During the implementation years of the Fourth FYDP Law, there was no borrowing from the Central Bank or the banking system (for financing budget deficit). Moreover, during the course of the Fourth FYDP, measures were taken to privatize state-owned companies. </p><p>The receipts of the Treasury General of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance from privatizing state-owned companies were respectively IR1,786.6 billion, IR818,6 billion, IR32,956.9 billion, IR10,959.3 billion, and IR62,936.2 billion during 1384-88 (2005/06-2009/10), with the highest amount related to 1388 (2009/10).</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bank Mellat was one of the leaders in the privatization of the Iranian banking sector. What sets Bank Mellat apart from its rivals in the banking industry?<br></h4><p>The bank was marked out for privatization according to Act 44 of the Constitution, and in fact it was the first Iranian bank to be privatized in early 2008. The management of the bank, especially my colleagues, played a very important role in the privatization of Iran's banking sector. After Bank Mellat was privatized, other banks joined Act 44, and now the share of the private banking industry is more than 50% of the system. At present, more than 80% of Bank Mellat shares are in the hands of the private sector, and for the past two years the directorship of the bank has been outside of government control. The shareholders now have control over the bank and four out of the five seats on the Board of Directors are in the hands of the private sector. One seat, amounting to a 20% share, remains in the hands of the government, though within a very short time this stake will also be sold off, making the bank fully privatized. For the last two years, the bank has been managed under a new charter based on the rules and regulations of the private sector. Bank Mellat has become the largest private bank in the country because of its financial position and in terms of the capital resources it holds. After increasing its general capital, which happened this year after the General Assembly meeting, the total capital of the bank now amounts to something around $1.6 billion.</p><h4>What activities does Bank Mellat specialize in? In what sectors of the Iranian economy does it have the best penetration rates?</h4><p>Bank Mellat's specialty area is retail banking, and it is most active in the retail banking processes of the financial market. We have about 20 million customers, meaning that most Iranian families have some involvement with Bank Mellat. One of the main sectors that Bank Mellat is active in is that of construction and the reconstruction of underdeveloped regions of the country. This is an area of great importance to Bank Mellat and we are true experts in this field.</p><div class="quote">“In the coming year we are going to build more than 30 schools around the country."</div><p>We have been very active in providing small-sized credits to families, for example to repair cars, move home, rent accommodation, or for other general family needs. In the retail market for micro-financing we are very well known around the country. We have also been active in many aspects related to social responsibility, such as helping villagers to rebuild their houses. And in order to protect the environment we have made available special loans to take older vehicles off the road and have them replaced with newer models. In our retail activities we have also been active in the agriculture sector, buying agricultural products for cash from farmers. The main agricultural product in Iran is wheat, and it is cultivated in nearly every village. Almost every year 12 million farmers are active in the cultivation of wheat. In Iran wheat is bought and sold by specialist traders, meaning that farmers do not have to look for customers as they sell through a system that is supervised by Bank Mellat. Some 1.5 million farmers every year deliver their wheat and receive cash immediately, and this system has been operated by Bank Mellat for the last five years.</p><p>Another specialty that the bank has become famous for is that it is active in promoting development in the more disadvantaged regions of the country, such as building schools, cultural centers, and giving financial aid to students to continue their education. Bank Mellat is a well-known institution in Iran—it is the bank of the people.</p><h4>How much of your budget do you allocate to regional development projects?</h4><p>In the coming year we are going to build more than 30 schools around the country. Another aspect of the bank's commitment to social responsibility is that we provide no-interest credit facilities to people convicted in court for crimes like driving accidents. In these kinds of cases, those convicted often do not have enough money to pay compensation to a victim's family, and so we facilitate the payment of compensation so that they can rejoin their families. In the past five years some 3,000 people were released from custody thanks to the loan facilities we provide.</p><h4>After privatization the first aim of any bank should be to maximize profits. Have you experienced any objections from your shareholders regarding these other social development activities?</h4><p>In fact, what I just explained to you has increased since privatization as social responsibility is considered a core duty of the bank. Our shareholders know that these kinds of activities help to strengthen our financial position in the market as well. In retail banking our main focus is on families with regular salaries. There are about 50 million people around the country using electronic debit cards. In retail banking Bank Mellat offers a wide range of electronic services, all of which were greatly welcomed by our customers. In the industrial sector we have been very active and have assisted many companies, such as in the automotive and cement sectors. However, our main focus is on retail banking, though we have also done a large amount of work on the investment, trade and commercial aspects of banking.</p><h4>What was the effect of privatization on your company? Has it changed the way you approach banking?</h4><p>In terms of human resources, all state regulations on employment were put aside after privatization and we are now following the policies of our human resources department regarding employment, like any private company. We have been successful in re-engineering our banking systems and increasing the quality and speed of providing services to our customers. What brought about   this change after privatization was the fact that the bank was more active in the IT sector and was able to meet all the requirements for working in this field very quickly. Before privatization we did not have an open hand to invest in the sort of telecommunication systems needed for e-banking. As for the financial aspects of our operations, we have been very successful in both reducing costs and increasing our net profit.</p><h4>Did this rationalization of the bank's activities after privatization result in branch losses?</h4><p>We reduced the number of branches, but this was not related to privatization. It started three years ago and the reason was that some branches were not economic to operate. We evaluated all of them, and as this is an ongoing process in the future some other branches may also close. Of course, with electronic banking we will need even fewer branches. In the modern world, the larger the investment you make in IT, the less you have to invest in the physical aspects of banking. Of course, we will always have physical branches because we are involved with families, and poor families do not have internet facilities. We currently have around 1,800 branches in Iran and 24,000 employees. Increasing or decreasing the number of employees will depend on the new programs and strategies of the bank. For now, we need this number of employees and use them all.</p><h4>Which sectors of the economy are you targeting for loans, and have you experienced any difficulties on your loan book?</h4><p>Apart from micro-credits and small-scale financing, an important field for us is the energy, oil, and gas sectors, such as the South Pars field and the Iran LNG Company. Some countries do not like us to be active in this sector, and there has been some negative propaganda in the global mass media related to the investments we have made for the sake of the people. They imagine that most of our activities are international, though this is not true and we have few operations outside the country. Unfortunately, their intelligence on Iran and on the banking system is wrong. For example, both the EU and the US Treasury describe Bank Mellat as being a state-run institution, which is completely incorrect. If the EU or US Treasury can make this kind of huge mistake regarding the ownership of a bank, then they are probably mistaken about other aspects of the country too.</p><h4>Do you have any special criteria that you use when assessing large-scale projects?</h4><p>The most important criterion is the profitability of the project. We take the feasibility of the project into consideration. Of course, many of these projects are huge and no single bank can fund such a deal on its own, and so we enter into syndicates with other banks to fund these projects.</p><h4>The number of Iranian banks is on the rise, and privatization is increasing the level of competition between them. What is your strategy to grow in such a competitive market?</h4><p>We are doing our best to increase the quality and quantity of the services we offer to our customers and use different tools to bring our services to them. As a result of the restrictions imposed on our international operations, we are trying to develop our internal market so that we can cover the 4% of profits that our foreign operations used to supply. We are trying to attract more customers so as to increase our level of deposits, and this will allow us to offer more facilities that are useful to people.</p><h4>You are also a university professor in the field of strategic management. How is Bank Mellat looking to improve the training of its employees?</h4><p>Let me explain about human capital and its peculiarities. In a country like ours, there is a great deal of room to make developments in the field of human capital, and we know that if development is made there will be significant change. In the world, a lot of stress is put on creating differentiation through human capital, and we also accept this. In fact, human capital is the element that brings creativity, innovation, and value creation, and can help develop an organization from within. At Bank Mellat we have a comprehensive program for the development of our human resources. There are three key dimensions to this program. The first is training, the second is empowerment, and the third is the individual development of human capital. We are working in all of these fields and are actively looking to develop the talent we have in our organization.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background information on Saman Bank? When was the bank established?<br></h4><p>We started our activities in September 1999. Basically, we received the first general license for a non-bank credit institute, and this was the first such license granted by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to a private entity after the Islamic Revolution. Based on the capital requirement for a credit institute at the time, we started with $1.1 million in fully paid capital. It is worth noting that we applied for the license two years prior to receiving it. The ex-governor of the CBI, Dr. Noorbakhsh, was in favor of the privatization of financial institutions to boost the sector's competition, dynamism, and development, and he managed to convince the Parliament to permit the issuance of such licenses. The CBI started with granting licenses for non-bank credit institutes. The only point that distinguished them from a bank was not having the permission to open current accounts and issue checkbooks. All other services, including deposit taking and granting loans, were permissible. Two years after that the CBI announced it would start granting banking licenses, and credit institutes that could increase their capital to $20 million were able to apply for one. We followed suit and started increasing our capital to $20 million as well. We were the third institution to receive a license purely due to the fact that all our shareholders were and are from the private sector with manufacturing backgrounds. Accumulating the required capital was a huge task and time consuming, given the fact that they did not want to dilute the ownership of the bank. EN Bank and Karafarin Bank received their licenses before we did. Currently, EN Bank is rightly using this claim to be “the first private bank of IR Iran" in its branding and advertisements. Actually, at the beginning only four credit institutes were granted a license in a short span of time, and we were the first to be granted a general license. Later on EN and Karafarin managed to increase their capital sooner than we did. I must say that, however, we were the trend setter, by introducing many new concepts. In fact the software we developed for our operations is being used by almost all private banks today, and the IT company we established is now one of the largest independent IT banking solution providers in the country.</p><h4>How many branches do you have throughout Iran?</h4><p>We have 120 branches at present with another 10 branches under construction. When we devised our strategy at the very beginning for 2001-2006 we produced a five-year plan focusing on product innovation by utilizing IT, and the opening of 250   branches. And during this time a lot of parameters changed, and so did our plan. We introduced a new branch concept to the market. Traditionally, branches in Iran were designed in a way that 70% of the space was allocated to employees and 30% to customers. We changed this concept. We made it an open-stand branch. We allocated 70% of the space to clients and only 30% to our staff. And because we had the proper technology, we were able to reduce the number of employees per branch. Let me make a comparison. In its Bazaar branch, Bank Melli has more than 150 employees and we managed to run our Bazaar branch with 14 employees. We are talking about more than $120 million worth of deposits in one branch. Then we increased that number from 14 to 20. Among the private sector banks, the per branch deposit level is between $40 million and $42 million, whereas with state-owned banks it is about $4 million to $6 million. This comparison can easily be used as an index for efficiency, which means that private banks are 10 times more efficient than public banks in that respect. In terms of deposits per branch our ranking hovers between second and third after Parsian Bank and Bank Pasargad.</p><div class="quote">“We do not use counters, you can come and sit down in our branch and a branch manager can do all of your tasks from just withdrawing cash to processing loans."</div><h4>Do you think this is because you are working mainly with companies?</h4><p>No, this is the case because we focus mainly on service. We are offering superior service, we care for our customers, we open branches in very convenient locations, and we have larger branches. The design is very important: We do not use counters, you can come and sit down in our branch and a branch manager can do all of your tasks from just withdrawing cash to processing loans. There is no going from one counter to another, which was the traditional way of banking.</p><h4>How did the strategy of the bank change in its first five years?</h4><p>During the first five years of operations, the competition changed because the government started offering new licenses to other banks. From the private sector, Parsian Bank entered the market, and Pasargad and Sarmaye started up their businesses. Now the structure of competition has changed. We had to focus more on electronic banking to maintain our lead and our edge in comparison with others. We established the very first Payment Service Provider (PSP) company by installing EFT-POS terminals in shops and retail outlets. So if I come back to the strategy of the bank, we were mainly focusing on the retail side. Although we did not have many branches available nationwide, we were mainly focused on retail and SMEs. The main reason for this was CBI regulations. You could not lend more than 20% of your capital base to one entity and its related parties or project, and of $20 million capital, 20% is just $4 million. So we could not approach large organizations needing $50 million or $100 million in financing. Therefore, we had to focus on SMEs and retail services to attract deposits. We were the first in many items, having had our strategy sketched around innovation. We were the first bank to introduce commercial papers, credit cards at a mass level, internet and mobile banking services, sharia-based overdraft facility, and the list continues.</p><h4>Credit cards are very important for retail banking. Why does your bank only issue them to customers who are SME owners?</h4><p>The only reason that we are unable to issue them en masse is that we do not have a proper credit-scoring agency in place, and so we have to take collateral to issue credit cards. This is why we cannot issue unsecured loans on a very large scale. We have issued 36,000 credit cards, and it is at present a special service for those customers who maintain deposits with us.</p><h4>How many customers do you currently have and what percentage are internet customers?</h4><p>In terms of customer numbers, we have just under 1 million, out of which we have more than 220,000 internet banking users. If we compare this to the more mature Western markets this is not a good ratio, but in this society it is amazing. Other banks have less than 10% of their customers using internet banking, though we are maintaining 23%. That is why we have been able to attract clients who are more educated. The average age of our clients is 34, they are mainly holding a bachelor's degree or a diploma at least, and they generally run their own companies and businesses.</p><h4>How do you plan to increase your capital?</h4><p>As I said, we started with $1.1 million; right now our paid up capital stands at  $225 million. This is the result of organic growth plus three capital increases through rights issues. The first one was to $20 million when we applied for a fully fledged banking license. The second one was from $25 million to $60 million, and the third one was from $90 million to $180 million. Having had a Return on Average Equity (ROAE) of more than 25% consistently for the past 10 years contributed significantly to our current capital level.</p><p>For the past couple of years, the CBI has changed regulations on the minimum capital necessary for a bank. It initially set it at $20 million, then after two years at $200 million, then $350 million, and now we have to increase our capital to $400 million by the end of March 2011 to maintain our license. This is why we changed our strategy between 2002 and 2007. And you see a lot of volatility in terms of regulations. The instability in regulations makes doing business difficult. We can increase our capital organically through our performance and our profitability, but when you are obliged to triple your capital in a very short span of time it becomes a different story. Then you have to bring in more money, fresh capital, from new investors. Bringing in a new investor in Iran is a very challenging task too. You need to have good partners that will be willing to stay with you on a long-term basis in order to maintain the stability of the organization. In a bank you cannot change partners every two years. Within a board you need consistency and long-term planning, since in a bank, unlike other organizations, you are working with peoples' cash, money, and funds. It is not a privately owned venture per se in which you can do whatever you would like. Consistency and stability in terms of decision-making in a bank to me is a first priority. However, if you have to increase your capital in the way that the Central Bank of Iran requires, you need to bring in new partners because you cannot increase your capital only through your profitability. This is why it was a big challenge for us in particular. Yet, up to now we have managed to increase our capital and maintain the stability and consistency of our board members. The board members of Saman Bank have never changed over the last 10 years.</p><h4>How did you solve the problem of increasing your capital?</h4><p>We intend to do the increase to $400 million locally. For that we have prepared a workable plan. Some $100 million of it comes from this year's profit, and the first six months' results are looking quite promising. Another $75 million we will do through a rights issue.</p><h4>What does the CBI seek to achieve by increasing the minimum capital requirements for private banks?</h4><p>There are two objectives. One was to reduce competition, because the CBI had many applications for licenses. However, the second thing is that the private banking sector in Iran grew quite tremendously and we have to manage our capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Right now we are hovering around 10% in terms of CAR, but to be categorized as a sound bank you have to be at least above 12 or 13%. The minimum requirement is 8%, of which we are well above, but to be on the safe side it is better to be above 12 or 14%. Higher than that and you are not properly utilizing deposits, and lower than that you are exposed to greater risk. However, based on Basel II requirements, which we implemented last year and disclosed in our 2009 Annual Report, our CAR ratio is 13%. The CBI's guideline states that we have to comply with Basel I requirements, but it has sent us some new guidelines stating that we have to start working on Basel II.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you think the current high demand for cars in Iran will be sustainable, especially after the removal of energy subsidies in the near future?</h4><p>Over the past 10 years, the Iranian market has experienced a rising trend in passenger car demand. In 2009, when all global manufacturers were suffering from an economic and production downturn, we experienced a 13% increase in production. We forecast that this rising trend will continue in the upcoming years. For 2021, we forecast that demand will increase to 2.3 million units for the local market in terms of passenger car and light pickup vehicles. And precisely because of this, we are actually increasing our position in the global ranks. In 2008, Iran was ranked as the 16th largest car manufacturer in the world, and in 2009 we were the 12th largest manufacturer in the world. We believe that this increasing trend will continue until 2016, while from 2016 onward we will begin to experience flatter demand in the market.</p><p>There are some factors that may speed up or slow down demand. Among them is fuel price and the removal of subsidies. We believe that this will have a short-term effect, but after that short period the growth trend will return because a vehicle is perceived to be an investment commodity in Iran, and we can maintain this status in the future. On the other hand, there will be factors that will affect demand positively, and the most important of these is the introduction of a vehicle scrappage scheme. As a large part of the Iranian local fleet is made up of older model cars, replacing these vehicles can help compensate for the flatter demand caused by higher energy prices.</p><div class="quote">“The localization rate depends on the product. For three products, Peugeot Pars, Peugeot 405, and Samand, the localization rate is almost 100%."</div><h4>Do you have any special plans to replace old vehicles?</h4><p>Yes, there was a proposal made by the motor vehicle manufacturers and submitted to the Iranian government last year. IKCO is one of the main figures behind this proposal, which outlines for the government how much liquidity is required to perform the scrappage scheme on a yearly basis. The government and the Central Bank approved it. Based on this proposal, IKCO will be responsible for replacing 200,000 vehicles and Saipa will be responsible for replacing another 200,000 of them within one year. The government has decided on a special loan to be given to the owners of older cars, and these vehicles will be valued as well. So, based on the price, the cars will be purchased, a loan will be given, and within this scheme the owners of older model cars will increase their purchasing power, and we can implement the scheme. This loan will be at least 60% of the car price.</p><h4>What is the current production capacity and nominal production of IKCO?</h4><p>The production capacity of IKCO is around 1 million units per year for passenger cars and light pick-up vehicles. Last year we produced 680,000 passenger cars and light pick-up units. The year before we produced 600,000 units, and for this year we plan to produce 780,000 units.</p><h4>The market share of IKCO is around 50% right now. Are you looking to maintain or increase your market share by 2015?</h4><p>Our market share from 2008 to 2009 has increased, and we have planned that by 2015 we will achieve a 55% market share. By 2015 our production volume will be around 1.4 million units. We have begun taking advantage of increased demand, and in parallel we have planned to increase our production capacity.</p><h4>What will be the focus of IKCO's strategy going forward?</h4><p>For the past 10 years, our investment has focused on increasing production capacity. But for the next 10 years our investment focus will be on the development of new products. We have already established our production capacity inside Iran, and some of these facilities are still under construction. Our production facility in Tabriz is busy with the production of pickups. In Mashhad, we have another site that produces two Suzuki and Peugeot-branded cars and one IKCO-branded car. The capacity of this site is 150,000 units per year. The site in Kermanshah will produce light commercial vehicles, and is now under construction. In September 2010 our production site in Mazandaran, in the city of Babol, was opened by the Deputy President of Iran, and it will produce luxury cars. There is another site under construction in Shiraz that will produce one IKCO model and two Peugeot models.</p><p>As IKCO, we are at a certain stage as a car producer. We started with the assembly of cars, and then we increased the localization level of the parts and components. After that, we introduced the Samand project as a national car. With this project, we learned how to design the body and trim of a car. After that, we arrived at the development and design of the power train and related components. With this project, we introduced some engines to the market that are now available and are in use in IKCO vehicles. We are now ready to produce our own cars suited to our own needs. In the next phase, we are going to design platforms. The design of national platforms is on IKCO's agenda.</p><h4>With the latest investments, IKCO is fast becoming an international company. Where are your production sites abroad and how did you decide to establish these production sites?</h4><p>Parallel to the local sites, we have established some international sites with regard to the amount of export demand we have received. Some of them are still under construction. One of the largest sites for IKCO is in Syria. It was opened in 2009 with a capacity of 30,000 units per year. We have another site in Venezuela, which was opened in a joint ceremony by President Ahmadinejad and President Chávez. In 2009, the production capacity was 25,000 units. We have another large site in Belarus, which is under construction. The capacity will be 30,000 units per year. We have another large site in Senegal. This site will be opened in the first week of November 2010 by high-ranking officials from Iran and Senegal and is set to produce 25,000 units of IKCO-branded cars annually. In all of these production sites we produce IKCO-branded cars, with the exception of in Egypt. In Egypt we have a cooperation agreement with Peugeot's representatives and produce Peugeot-branded cars.</p><h4>Does IKCO export cars from Iran to other countries?</h4><p>Six years ago, we developed plans to export our products to target markets. In 2007, we reached our highest figure, which was around 45,000 units. In 2008 and 2009, due to the global financial crisis, we saw a decrease in exports. However, for 2010 we have planned on 60,000 units for export. We will achieve this export target through two methods. One of them is the direct export of CBUs (completely built units) to export markets, and the other is the export of CKD (completely knocked down) units to our international sites. We believe that we will reach these targets since we will be introducing two new products, and we have already received strong demand for these products.</p><p>In 2015, we are looking to allocate 15% of our production to exports. One of the hindrances to foreign exports is the regulations and standards that are being introduced in these countries in the coming years. As part of our product-development investment, we have developed our products in a way that they are able to meet these new standards and regulations.</p><h4>For these product development plans, which will be the biggest part of your investments in the near future, and which international companies are you working with? Will you continue your relationships with Peugeot and Renault?</h4><p>We have worked with Peugeot for about 22 years, and Peugeot is one of IKCO's major partners. It has been about six years that we and the Saipa Company developed a joint, common-platform project with Renault of France (Logan). Based on this, we have introduced the Tondar to the Iranian market. There is another partner, Mercedes-Benz, with which we have been working for about 30 years, specifically in the commercial segment, for buses and trucks. We have another company called Iran Khodro Diesel, which is responsible for the production of IKCO's commercial vehicles. In Iran Khodro Diesel, we have established a 30,000 unit capacity for the production of commercial vehicles. We have another Japanese company as a partner, Suzuki, with which we have recently started to work. We have plans to develop our cooperation with Suzuki in the coming years.</p><h4>What percentage of auto parts is produced locally?</h4><p>The localization rate depends on the product. For three products, Peugeot Pars, Peugeot 405, and Samand, the localization rate is almost 100%. For the Peugeot 206, we have achieved 60% localization. There is another product in development phase called the Runna. This will be introduced in the C-segment of the market. The price will be between $10,000 and $12,000. This will be introduced under the IKCO brand, and we have targeted 100% localization at the time of its introduction to the market. The Runna will be engineered, developed, and designed by Iranian engineers. Based on the lessons we learned from the Samand as a national car, and the technologies that we achieved and received, we plan to develop and introduce the Runna as the second brand for IKCO. One of our major targets for developing the Runna was exports, so that we are able to produce the Runna beside the Samand at our international sites.</p><h4>Iran aims to improve its public transportation system, which means that the country will need more new buses. Does IKCO have any plans to address this demand?</h4><p>Yes, one of the important plans of Iran Khodro Diesel is to increase the production capacity of its bus and minibus production lines. In 2009, we experienced a 10% increase in production of Iran Khodro Diesel. However, the demand for public transport vehicles in Iran exceeds that of the capacity of local manufacturers. In order to be able to decrease the level of imports in this segment, just as in the passenger car segment, we have increased the local content of our commercial segment. For example, for some heavy-duty trucks, more than 70% is localized and we are developing a national project called the National Bus in order to meet market demand. We expect to introduce the National Bus by the end of 2011.</p><h4>What about the environmental pollution issue in Iran. Do you have any plans to improve emission standards?</h4><p>Yes, this is one of the important points that we have taken into account. In Iran, vehicle manufacturers are obliged to meet Euro 2 and Euro 3 standards. In 2012, all manufacturers should meet the Euro 4 standard. In line with this requirement, we have plans to develop our engines in a way to be able to meet such standards by 2012. Besides the pollution issue, fuel consumption is also very important for us because of the increasing price of petrol. We have developed many plans to make our engines more energy efficient. We have developed plans to develop hybrid and electric vehicles using IKCO engines, and we have defined some projects in this regard. As you know, we have large gas reserves in Iran, and because of this we developed plans six years ago to introduce compressed natural gas (CNG)-capable products. Currently, 50% of the production of IKCO is capable of using CNG as a source of fuel. We have set a 70% target for next year. Taking into account the news about the increasing price of gasoline, we have seen that in the past few months there has been a sharp increase in demand for CNG-capable products in the market.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[no-compromise-on-quality]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history behind Behran Oil, and how long have you been with company?</h4><p>The company was first established as a joint venture between a syndicate of Iranian investors (75%) and Esso (EXXON) Oil Company (25%) in 1963. I started working in this company as a lab supervisor when I was 25, and I've been working here for 34 years. I have been involved mainly in the technical aspects of the industry, which I've specialized in, and have authored several books and articles on lubricants for the guidance of Iranian consumers. I also have an Executive MBA, and have had different management responsibilities in this company.</p><p>This is the only company I've ever worked for. The reason perhaps is that at the time of Esso, I saw how they gave importance to the recruitment of competent personnel and their training and development, as well as the very advanced technical expertise of the company. After our Islamic Revolution, the relationship with Esso was cut and we tried to maintain the same corporate culture at the company that was renamed Behran Oil. I think that has been an important factor in making us one of the most successful companies in Iran.</p><div class="quote">“Behran's publications, as well as its technical seminars, have also played an important role in improving popular trust in the quality of nationally produced lubricants."</div><h4>How has the company developed over the years?</h4><p>In 1964 the company established a blending plant for which the base oil was supplied from the Abadan refinery and additives were imported from Western countries and these materials were blended to produce Esso-branded lubricants in Iran. Around 1969, the company established a refinery and produced its own base oil. The original capacity of that refinery was 30,000 tons of base oil per year, all of which was converted to motor oils and industrial oils. After the Revolution in 1979, the products were distributed under the Behran brand.</p><p>During the Imposed War between Iran and Iraq, all industries were in the service of defense as well as civil activities, but after the war we went into rapid expansion, and now we are producing 250,000 tons of base oil per annum, as well as 350,000 tons per year of finished products such as motor oils, industrial oils, antifreezes, plus rubber process oils (RPOs), and paraffin waxes. In total, the capacity of our company for the production of finished products is more than 500,000 tons per year.</p><h4>How does Behran rank in terms of base oil production capacity in Iran?</h4><p>Today there are five refineries for lubricants in Iran; The first is Sepehan Oil in Esfahan, which is now a semi-private company that has a nominal capacity of 400,000 tons per annum. The second and third refineries belong to Iranol Oil, which are located in Tehran and Abadan, and have a total capacity of 300,000 tons per year of base oils, and the next lubricants refinery (third in ranking from the capacity aspect) is Behran Oil, located in Tehran, with a capacity of 250,000 tons per year of base oil. The fourth refinery is Pars Oil, located in Tehran, with a capacity of 160,000 tons of base oil per year. All in all, Iran has a total base oil producing capacity of 1 billion liters per year, all of which are of the Group I kind.</p><h4>How much of this capacity is consumed in Iran and how much is exported?</h4><p>The demand for finished lubricants in Iran is about 700,000 tons per year, so, the surplus [base oil] is exported, mainly by Sepahan and Iranol, and some by Pars. The interesting point is that Behran Oil uses all its produced base oil and also imports about 100,000 tons of Group II and Group III base oils, because it has the largest market share of lubricants in Iran.</p><p>Of course, Behran also exports finished lubricants as well as RPOs, paraffin waxes, and antifreeze. In the past, consumers used to change their motor oils about once every 1,000 kilometers, but with the production of higher quality level lubricants (a first for Behran), Iranian drivers now change their motor oil every 5,000 kilometers on average.</p><p>Behran's publications, as well as its technical seminars, have also played an important role in improving popular trust in the quality of nationally produced lubricants and, as a consequence, despite the phenomenal increase in vehicle production in Iran, the consumption of lubricants hasn't increased at anywhere near the same rate. But when it comes to exports, although Iranian base oils enjoy a great deal of popularity, the finished lubricants have a tough time competing in foreign markets due to the profusion of famous international brands. Of course, Behran has been successful in this field, too.</p><h4>What sets Behran apart from its competitors in Iran?</h4><p>The main aspect that sets Behran Oil apart from its competitors is its high brand popularity, which results in a higher market share. As I mentioned before, Behran has to import extra base oils (Group II, III, and synthetic) in order to supply its markets.</p><h4>What sorts of lubricants are produced in Iran? Is there a need to import the more advanced types of lubricants for modern machinery?</h4><p>More than 95% of the lubricants that can be produced using Group I base oil are produced in Iran. Although some special greases and synthetic lubricants are imported, many high-quality modern lubricants that need groups II, III, or synthetic base oils are also produced in Iran—mainly by Behran, of course. There are a number of internationally known companies blending famous branded lubricants in Iran, as well as importing their products for sale.</p><h4>What has been the secret behind Behran's success, and its strong position in the market?</h4><p>I believe that it has to do with our management model. Our management doesn't change much, and we have a high retention rate when it comes to personnel. But perhaps the most important criteria is Behran's organizational culture. Throughout its history, Behran has been committed to producing quality products and is loyal to its customers. In other words, we have never compromised on the quality of our products to make an extra buck. Our products have the approval of the most creditable machinery manufacturers in the world. On top of all this, we have established marketing technical services (MTS) for our industries throughout the country. Behran has MTS offices in the centers of Iran's main provinces. In fact, our engineers are dependable consultants for both industry and the public. We also have strong quality control and R&amp;D facilities, which have enabled us to develop the required lubricants. And the versatility of Behran's products is also an important point. Behran produces more than 1,000 types of lubricants and related products, including different viscosity grades of lubricants and their packaging.</p><h4>What is Behran's share in the engine oil market today?</h4><p>According to official statistics, Behran on its own has a 40-43% share of the motor oil market and a 30% share of the industrial lubricant market in Iran. The company also exports about $40 million in finished lubricants, RPOs, and paraffin waxes.</p><h4>How will the ending of energy subsidies affect your company?</h4><p>In the short run the lubricant industry will encounter a slowdown in demand, especially in the passenger car lubricants segment, but not so much in the commercial sector because buses and trucks have to keep running. But in the long run, we expect normal consumption habits to resume. In Iran we will eventually have to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles, so generally, in terms of lubricants, the size of our market will decrease (because of longer oil change intervals), but I think that the increase in the number of vehicles will eventually bring us back to where we were.</p><h4>What are your investment plans for the future?</h4><p>We have many projects. We intend to establish a Group II and III refinery, even though the technology isn't easily available to us. We are trying to find some other ways of getting around this situation. I believe that in a few years you will find that we are producing Group II base oil. We are also studying our participation in establishing a petroleum refinery that would produce fuels as well as other products.</p><h4>Do you think it was the Esso foundations that gave you the edge that you retained over the years?</h4><p>To some extent yes. In fact, in the first years after Esso left Iran, the refinery that had been built, the personnel who were trained, and the management and other disciplines that were set by Esso, helped us to continue running the company successfully. Later on, other factors like our R&amp;D center, our benchmarking endeavors, and our participation in international and national seminars and conferences through which we both received and shared our experiences have had more important effects on our success. At the present, our colleagues have regular presentations at the ICIS-LOR international base oil conferences in the Middle East, for example.</p><h4>Are you involved in any environmental projects?</h4><p>We are one of the most environmentally aware companies in Iran. We have contributed to environmental protection by increasing the quality level and environmentally friendly formulations of our lubricants and other products. This means higher drain intervals for oils and antifreezes (and so less water and soil pollution), and also longer lifespans for engines, lower emissions, and less air pollution. We have also established sewage and waste treatment systems in our plants. We now convert most of our burning systems from heavy pollutant fuels to cleaner fuels as gas, resulting in cleaner air. We have installed more fuel-efficient electricity generators, and are developing the green space around our plants.</p><p>All of this means that we are at the forefront of environmental responsibility. We also utilize energy management systems that involve a lot of energy auditing and modifications to make energy consumption as cost-effective as possible, and produce less CO2. We are in compliance with ISO quality management systems, such as ISO 9,000, ISO 14,000, and ISO 18,000.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[core-focus]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core focus of your activities in Dubai and the significance of the Emirate in terms of your global operations?</h4><p>Emirates NBD has a leading retail banking franchise in the UAE, with 168 branches and over 780 ATMs and CDMs. It is a major player in the UAE corporate banking arena, and has strong Islamic banking, global markets and treasury, private and investment banking, asset management, and brokerage operations. The group has operations in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Singapore, the UK, and Jersey in the Channel Islands, and representative offices in India and Iran. The group is an active participant and supporter of the UAE's main development initiatives and of various educational, environmental, cultural, charity, and community welfare establishments.</p><h4>What are the strengths of the banking system in the Emirate?</h4><p>Over the last 40 years, Dubai has transformed its economy to consist of international trade, banking, tourism, real estate, and manufacturing. The government's investment in transportation, telecommunications, energy, and industrial infrastructure has opened up many routes to an extensive foreign trade network. Coupled with the incredible infrastructure and the safe political environment it offers its residents, Dubai has emerged as a leading regional commercial hub and a world-class business environment. Dubai's ability to overcome the financial crisis that occurred in 2008 reflects strong government support that enables the Emirate to be a stable and conducive environment for prosperity.</p><div class="quote">“Emirates NBD is committed to engaging all its stakeholders in a sustainable and responsible manner."</div><h4>What regional trends have you witnessed in the retail banking sector?</h4><p>At present, the regional trend is to focus on the customer, and Emirates NBD has been at the forefront of creating innovative products that will further enhance customer satisfaction and increase its customer base. Emirates NBD continues to improve its technology and customer service standards, which is reflected by the launch of Tanfeeth and a variety of other consumer-related initiatives.</p><h4>Emirates NBD is the UAE's largest lender. Do you see banks in the region increasing lending levels in the near future?</h4><p>Given recent global economic events, the outlook has become more cautious and uncertain. As a result, we are expecting lower levels of loan growth than before. For 2012, we are aiming for gross loan growth at around 4%-5%, with contributions from both retail and corporate lending.</p><h4>How is the recent takeover of Dubai Bank by Emirates NBD demonstrative of the Dubai government's desire to consolidate the banking sector?</h4><p>The acquisition of Dubai Bank by Emirates NBD signals a new phase rich in opportunities for both banks. The transaction closed against a cash consideration equal to the fair value of the entity acquired. The financial results of Dubai Bank were consolidated on October 11, 2011 without any impact on the group's net profits or non-performing loan (NPL) ratio on the date of the takeover. The recent integration of Dubai Bank ATMs within the Emirates NBD network has been a successful and important milestone in the integration process. In the coming months, Emirates NBD will complete the next phase of integration that will enable Dubai Bank customers to access new options, such as utility bill payments, when using Emirates NBD ATMs.</p><h4>You have stated that Dubai Bank will remain a subsidiary of Emirates NBD, but what plans are there to create synergies between the two operations?</h4><p>The completion and appointment of the unified top management team, as well as the establishment of the executive committee to manage both banks, is an important milestone in combining the management teams. This is a step toward further enhancing our customer service for the two banks. In addition, synergies are expected to arise through cost savings resulting from the consolidation of functions and activities, as well as revenue synergies in terms of lower funding costs.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the creation of the Center of Operational Excellence known as Tanfeeth?</h4><p>Building on the success of Network International, the creation of Tanfeeth was a strategic decision aimed at providing world-class services to the bank as well as its external clients across many industries. The decision was of great value to Emirates NBD as it offers opportunities to reengineer our processes and introduce global best-practice tools and technology that will improve efficiency and enhance the quality of the service that we offer customers.</p><h4>How has the global liquidity crisis impacted the banking industry?</h4><p>Several significant macroeconomic events occurred in 2011, including the Arab spring, the tsunami in Japan, debt ceiling issues in US, and the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe. These factors have impacted businesses across the globe, and local and regional economies are not immune. As a result, many markets witnessed weaker private sector activity and consumer confidence. Moreover, access to international capital markets was affected by heightened global uncertainty and risk aversion. In the context of this macroeconomic backdrop, the UAE economy was relatively resilient with a strong, healthy banking system and liquidity levels, as well as an average of mid single-digit operating profitability.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Dubai's capital markets in 2012?</h4><p>Emirates NBD has continued to boost its drive toward increased transparency with analysts, investors, and customers at large, enabling further business opportunities while aiding the capital markets. In recent months, the Gulf's capital markets have witnessed a surge in sukuk and conventional bond issuance as markets have improved, following the tight global conditions in 2011. Other parts of the world are seeing the value of tapping these markets, especially Asia. Other sources of finance are emerging with the development of the offshore renminbi (CNH) market, funding that is proving very attractive. Emirates NBD recently launched a CNH1 billion bond, which attracted strong investor appetite and was priced at a competitive level.</p><h4>How active is Emirates NBD in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities?</h4><p>In line with its vision and mission, Emirates NBD is committed to engaging all its stakeholders in a sustainable and responsible manner, making it one of the most active financial institutions in the community with a clear CSR strategy. Over the last year, Emirates NBD has worked to support and develop three focus areas in its community: education, environment, and health care. As we are a group driven by customer satisfaction, our numerous golfing events give us the opportunity to please our internal and external customers. At Emirates NBD, we are aware of the passion and excitement one feels when golfing next to champions. Horse racing is a national UAE sport, and one that we share a passion for at Emirates NBD. As a highly competitive, pedigree sport, horse racing is aligned to our own values of success and ancestral heritage. Therefore, Emirates NBD is the Dubai World Cup official banking partner and sponsor. Having established a firm place among the top thoroughbred racing events in the world, the Dubai World Cup attracts a global audience each year. Our sponsorship also provides us with invaluable international exposure that goes hand-in-hand with participating in this high-profile event and helps strengthen our brand recognition globally.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Prime Aviation begin its operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our parent company, Prime Aviation Holding, is located in Singapore. Prime Aviation is fully incorporated in Kazakhstan, where we operate on behalf of a number of high-net-worth (HNW) individuals and two charter aircraft that support the oil industry. On a secondary basis, we hold an operator certificate that supports our customers seeking air transport services out of Almaty or Kazakhstan. Part of our fleet is privately managed and geared toward a number of HNW individuals, and we perform aircraft maintenance on their behalf. Through personal assistants we are informed as to a client's requirements, and thus we manage the entire process. We ensure that the crew and engineers are trained, the aircraft is serviceable, and that all the documentation is up to date.</p><h4>To which destinations do you see the largest demand?</h4><p>We can fly anywhere with our charter aircraft, whether in and out of Europe, Asia, or the Middle East. On occasion, we also fly to America. We fly to Europe with aircraft registered in Aruba or the Isle of Man. With three of our aircraft, we fly domestically in Kazakhstan and throughout the CIS region. We also operate services to Moscow and the Far East, flying to locations such as Hong Kong, China, and Singapore.</p><div class="quote">“The evolution of aerospace in Kazakhstan has required heavy investments from the government in order to meet European standards."</div><h4>How do customers pay for Prime Aviation's services?</h4><p>Our customers first choose the size of the aircraft desired, and then we begin our calculations. After the core costs are assessed, we ask where the customer wants to fly. For example, flying to Astana is much cheaper than to Moscow. This is because in Moscow everything takes place in business airports, and customers have limited choices. From there, we begin to assess other costs. Going to Astana accrues a smaller cost, whereas flying to Moscow is less affordable. We ask, and the customers tell us what they want; for food, we could serve a sandwich or caviar. Prime Aviation also offers a standard pack with set costs. We also consider time as a factor, and how long the customers will be away. The number of passengers is also up to the customer, who can choose between nine and 13 travelers on each aircraft. The basic fee to fly from here to the Maldives incorporates the basic costs of the aircraft multiplied by the number of hours it will fly, in combination with the Maldives as a destination. We are very transparent with our customers and explain how we arrive at a final price.</p><h4>How does Prime Aviation contribute to the development of civil aviation in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Three years ago, the aerospace industry in Kazakhstan was deeply impacted after a European ban was imposed, affecting how we do our business. The European ban was a product of an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) audit, in which the global watchdog reviewed the country and found a few areas that needed to be rectified. The ICAO works throughout the world, and in Europe the decision was made to impose a ban on air operations from Kazakhstan. The ban did not affect Air Astana, because at that time the management of the company had implemented safeguards that complied with European requirements. Air Astana was able to convince the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) that the company was fit to fly in Europe. However, the limitation specified that Air Astana can fly to Europe, but only to certain destinations and with specific aircraft. For the rest of the airlines, it meant that they could no longer fly to Europe. Therefore, we have been appealing the decision since it came into place, and the solution has two parts. Firstly, we have to rectify the outstanding audit against the Civil Aviation Committee (CAC) of Kazakhstan. Then, individual operators can be authorized to fly to Europe, and that process is ongoing. As Prime Aviation, we have followed Air Astana's lead and incorporated European standards of operational control. Moreover, we have presented our advancements to EASA, and its auditors are very happy with our progress. Unfortunately, they can't release us from the ban until the CAC resolves a host of other issues. The steps Prime Aviation has taken can be used as a model for other operators in the country to remove themselves from the ban. The ban is the major challenge, and the danger is that international organizations may not see the progress they're expecting from the country. Kazakhstan has had three years to fix the industry, and more progress is needed. The evolution of aerospace in Kazakhstan has required heavy investments from the government in order to meet European standards. However, Kazakhstan is not alone; countries such as Indonesia have been in the same position. If Europe was not following a very bureaucratic system, we might not be a victim of the ban; each individual country could have different opinions about aviation regulations.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DuPont has been operating in Mexico for 86 years, and has achieved a strong reputation in this market. What has made DuPont so successful in the Mexican market?</h4><p>Our core values enable us to manage the business and focus on the right things. You don't exist in a country for 86 years—and globally for 209 years—without strong values to guide you. We always make sure to stay true to our four core values: safety, respect for the environment, respect for people, and ethical business operations. We are also defined by our strong tradition of science-based innovation. Our company has very strong scientific capabilities that enable us to innovate as the market changes so that we can identify and respond to our customers' needs. That emphasis on innovation has manifested itself in the strong growth we've experienced in Mexico over the last 86 years.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance of Mexico for DuPont?</h4><p>Mexico was DuPont's first international operation outside the US and Canada. Our total value as part of DuPont in terms of sales is about $1.7 billion annually out of $5 billion worth of sales in Latin America. That includes exports as well. We're growing at a rate of over 30% in 2011 in comparison to 2010, when we reached historical high levels in sales and earnings. We have a diversified business in Mexico, with all of our 13 strategic business units (SBUs) represented in the country, including seeds (corn and sorghum), food ingredients, coatings, polymers, and imaging and electronics, among others. We have a strong manufacturing base in Mexico, with seven operations in total. We also have seven R&amp;D and application centers in the country, with 3,000 employees. We consider ourselves a high-tech producer, since we're heavily automated in our facilities. We continue to invest in Mexico. Our geographic location here is perfect for North-South and East-West transactions, nestled between the biggest economy in the world, the US, and Latin America to the south.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico's potential is being acknowledged if you consider the number of multinational companies investing in the country."</div><h4>In your opinion, what is the most innovative product DuPont has developed, and what made that possible?</h4><p>We've produced many innovative products throughout our history, from the protective layers on astronauts' uniforms, to materials used in the Mars landing module. We've developed technologies to improve everyday life and comfort, such as the discovery of innovative fabrics, as well as for their use in industrial applications, to modern breakthroughs in synthetic production of Omega-3 using sugar cane as basic feed material, or latest generation crop protection products and biofuel technology, to name a few. We've had Nobel laureates working for our company. We've contributed a great deal to food production and food safety technologies. We've also been a significant contributor to advancing the energy and transportation industries, and have significant innovation research in the field of alternative energy.</p><h4>What other investment plans do you have on the horizon?</h4><p>We will invest around $300 million-$350 million per year over the next three years, including the Altamira expansion. One recent investment involved the acquisition in June 2010 of the Danish food ingredients and enzymes company Danisco, which has a global reach and 400 employees in Mexico. Its sales in Mexico are close to $100 million.</p><h4>What role do you envision for DuPont in the housing sector after the completion of the sustainable housing project on which you are partnering with Industrias Repshel?</h4><p>Housing is one of those sectors where we seek partnerships with companies that engage in that sector as their core business. When we become active in a segment, we first identify unmet needs in that particular market, and then work collaboratively with some partners—like Repshel in this case—to develop a solution. Besides being a good business opportunity, I think this fills an important social need in terms of providing affordable, clean housing. It's the right thing to do, because there is a global housing deficit. We've partnered with Repshel to provide the science and technology to create a complete polymer-cement encapsulated solution that is self-constructed by the family, can be built in five to seven days, includes running water and electricity, and is by the far the most affordable option on the market. Repshel is in the business of extrusion, which can be used to build not only houses, but schoolrooms, small rural clinics, and so on. Our contribution is titanium dioxide technology as well as other polymer technology and additives, which gives the material resistance, durability, and the necessary refraction required during summer. Besides being a reality in Mexico, the project has already been exported to Argentina and Chile, and is perfect for areas afflicted by natural disasters where you need durable affordable housing for victims of floods, earthquakes, mudslides, and other natural disasters. They are very solid, and can even resist hurricanes. We also offer coatings for the housing industry.</p><h4>How would you rate Mexico in terms of technological and scientific development?</h4><p>I believe Mexico has the potential to grow in that area. We're still far from fully realizing that potential. When you look at the number of patents in Mexico as a percentage of overall patents globally and in Latin America, it is very low. We have some good initiatives coming through, and government effort too, but we need a good, long-term collaboration between government, the private sector, and academia if Mexico is to advance in terms of technological and scientific development. We have the right demographics and quality educational institutions. We graduate a high number of engineers from multiple disciplines every year, and have a very skilled workforce. Mexico's potential is being acknowledged if you consider the number of multinational companies investing in the country. We at DuPont are developing an innovation center in Mexico to connect with all our main global R&amp;D centers as well as to coordinate with our seven R&amp;D and application centers around Mexico and leverage DuPont technology for the benefit of our customers in the region.</p><h4>What role do you envision for the future of DuPont in the Mexican market and Latin America?</h4><p>Latin America has great potential. DuPont's sales in Latin America in 2002 were $1.2 billion; in 2011 they are expected to reach $5 billion, and by 2019 about $10 billion. Our average rate of growth over the next few years will be two to three times higher than GDP in the region. We expect to double our sales over the next five years, and we've tripled sales over the last seven or eight years. Our role in Mexico's development will grow in the areas of the three identified megatrends I mentioned: food production, alternative energy sources, and the protection of people and the environment.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abraaj Capital is the only private equity group in the global top 50 with operations based outside of Europe or the US. What has been the driving force behind the success of your operations?</h4><p>We owe our success largely to our focus and persistence throughout our 10-year history. Abraaj Capital has a strong commitment to the region, and beyond that, to high growth markets in general. Very early on, we recognized the entire region as a source of opportunity. When the firm was established, we identified the Middle East as a region with an interesting demographic and growth profile, and saw that the corresponding opportunity for investment would be tremendous. By focusing on that vision and building teams ahead of time, we have been able to grow the business steadily.</p><h4>What factors led to Dubai being the hub for Abraaj Capital's regional operations?</h4><p>Dubai is a very effective place to service the broader MENASA (Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia) region. Ultimately, however, we are a private equity firm that invests over a very wide geography. Theoretically, we could be based anywhere, but there are a number of factors at play. One is logistics and connectivity. Looking at the central location of Dubai, the city is perfectly placed both for business and for living. Historically, the city has served as a hub, and although the Emirate is often still associated with real estate, it has always been a trade and business hub. We are based in the DIFC, and all of the service providers here view Dubai as a gateway to the UAE and beyond. Dubai has the ability to draw in talent, and so we are able to attract a high-end talent pool.</p><div class="quote">“Our investors are entities that choose Abraaj on the back of our track record."</div><h4>You recently announced plans to invest in 15 small businesses around the Middle East. What is the strategy behind this move?</h4><p>You are correct in that Abraaj recently announced its 14th investment through its small- and mid-cap (SMC) investment platform. We are looking of course at commercial returns. Our investors are entities that choose Abraaj on the back of our track record and, ultimately, our growth is dependent on the ability to deliver superior performance to our investors. The SMC segment specifically provides very interesting opportunities, and our focus on this segment is a reflection of the belief that as companies grow in size there are new ways to enhance and focus investments and private equity opportunities. We decided to set up a dedicated vehicle, in the form of Riyada Enterprise Development, which identifies and invests in SMCs across the MENA area. We have found this strategy to have worked very well for us, and since the launch of the RED platform we have invested in 14 high-growth companies across nine industries and eight countries in the MENA region.</p><h4>How do you target SMCs?</h4><p>It is done largely through a proprietary deal flow. We are very local in the markets we operate in, and although Dubai is our hub and base, we have a presence in most of the geographies in which we've invested. By having a physical presence, we are close to the deal flow; we know the landscape and understand the businesses at work. After 10 years in the business, we have delivered a large number of success stories, and so businesses that are seeking growth now approach us directly. They view Abraaj Capital as a partner of choice. We also pro-actively look for new prospects, and occasionally find opportunities through intermediaries, such as banks and investment banks.</p><h4>The healthcare sector has played a strategic role in Abraaj Capital's investments. What makes this sector so attractive?</h4><p>Health care is a sector with massive growth potential, and one we find to be extremely interesting. We have exposure to multiple aspects of the sector, from pharmaceutical retail, to hospitals, medical labs, and everything in between. If you look at the demographics of growth markets, they are very underserved and underinvested in terms of health care across the board, and specifically in the MENA region. They are underserved right through from hospital beds to diagnostic labs and infrastructure. Locally, health care has become one of the key priorities of the government. There is significant investment potential, especially for public-private partnerships (PPPs). It's a space that provides opportunities at different levels, and is largely counter-cyclical.</p><h4>Why was now chosen as the right time to divest your interest in Turkish hospital group Acıbadem?</h4><p>We invested in Acıbadem in 2008 at the peak of the boom, and during the four-five years that we held it, which were probably some of the most challenging in recent history, the business more than tripled in size in terms of profitability along a number of other metrics, including creating more than 5,000 jobs. The number of hospitals within the group also increased from six to 13, which proves that even in times of financial uncertainty and challenging environments, the sector continues to grow. There is a natural holding period for us, however. We go into an investment with a clear view on delivering support and value to the existing shareholder, entrepreneurs, and principals, in order to take the business to the next level. We ultimately aim to deliver returns to our investors, and so at some point we have to exit and seek opportunities elsewhere. However, we believe that the opportunities for the group remain strong, and that is why we continue to invest and have remained a shareholder in the holding company, IHH Healthcare Berhad.</p><h4>What other sectors do you believe hold interesting growth potential in the region?</h4><p>The reality is that the region is largely underinvested across the board. The core factor at play is the demographic make-up of the region—there is a very young population, and as the growing middle class emerge they will continue to spend and have needs, from white goods, to retail, to financial services, to health care. Sectors that are consumer driven are very interesting, and if you look at the MENA region, opportunities around natural resources will also continue to be key. Both soft and hard infrastructure continues to be underinvested also.</p><h4>To what extent did Dubai's debt troubles reveal certain flaws in the way in which the economy was evolving?</h4><p>Taking the situation into context, the global financial crisis took everyone by surprise, and while it began in the West, it really affected the whole world. Dubai, as a fast-moving, aggressive economy that was largely well integrated, received a disproportionate impact as compared to more insular countries. It was the very fact that Dubai had grown so successfully and was so well integrated that resulted in the crisis delivering such a significant speed bump to the economy. The impact was largely representative of Dubai's drive to push forward, even at the expense of being slightly less protected. Locally and globally lessons have been learned, and we have started to see a steady recovery since 2010. Looking at Dubai's role as a hub, as well as in airport passenger traffic, port traffic, tourism, retail, and hospitality sector growth, it is clear that the Emirate is starting to demonstrate a steady recovery.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you forecast will be the impact of the euro zone crisis on the Turkish financial sector?</h4><p>Turkey's financial markets and banking sector had the ability to not only withstand the effects of the 2001 crisis, but to also recover fairly quickly in 2010 and 2011. Our financial performance made the country home to one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Recently, concerns about debt sustainability in the euro zone have intensified, and there are increased risks regarding global economic activity. During a recession in Europe, the Turkish economy is adversely affected through various channels. The decline in risk appetite is thought to limit capital inflows toward emerging countries, including Turkey. Accordingly, we expect a growth rate of around 3.5% in 2012 for the Turkish economy, which grew 8.5% in 2011. The narrowing of economic growth is also reflected in the financial sector. However, Turkish banks are less reliant on foreign funding than many other emerging markets. As of 2011, customer deposits, the majority of which are domestic, constitute 57.1% of our total liabilities. Compared to 2010, the total funds raised by the banking sector via foreign banks increased by 20.3% in 2011 to $98.2 billion. The amount of loans from abroad increased by $5.8 billion, whereas funds from repo transactions, deposits, and syndicated loans grew by $5.7 billion, $3.7 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. However, the volume of securitization loans decreased by $0.9 billion, due to installment payments on principal balances. In terms of credits, the Turkish banking sector performed well thanks to its sound and stable structure, with high capital adequacy ratios. In recent years, long-term credit rollover ratios have stood generally above 100%, with the exception of 2009, when the Turkish banking sector achieved a rollover of slightly lower than 78% of its long-term credits. In 2011, the long-term debt rollover ratio for the Turkish banking system was 177%, which indicates that the problems in the international markets have not yet been reflected on the external financing channel. Considering the fact that countries with a major share in funding are relatively more stable, the rollover ratio of the banking sector is expected to remain at or above 130% in 2012. In terms of short-term funding, we have observed a downward trend in foreign borrowing in the form of syndication and securitization loans since 2008, due to the diversification of funding sources. On the other hand, fundraising via collateralized loans and non-collateralized bilateral loans has registered increases. In 2011, bond issuances in international markets with maturities of five or more years have been another important tool for widening the funding base. We forecast that this style of financing will expand during 2012. International institutions have been another financing source for funding over the past couple of years. Since 2009, institutions such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the French Agency for Development (AFD) have supported the private sector in Turkey, with an ongoing emphasis on promoting sustainable energy efficiency, renewable energy, and agribusiness. This funding mechanism has been mainly secured through Turkish local commercial banks. Bearing in mind the possible cost increases, we don't anticipate a sudden stop in short-term funding. So far, İş Bank has not seen any funding difficulties or pressures emanating from euro zone concerns or deleveraging, although there are clear and present risks associated with global risk aversion and the lack of steady funding.</p><h4>Growth in assets and loans in Turkey's banking sector has been projected to slow down and bank profits are set to decline in 2012. Do you support the unorthodox monetary policies of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT)?</h4><p>With the divergence between domestic and foreign demand conditions, the current account deficit has widened significantly over the post-crisis period. The CBT stated that financial stability risks were evident as the rapidly increasing current account deficit was fueled by short-term capital inflows. The capital inflows toward Turkey have intensified as the developed economies' central banks continued their very loose monetary policies. Strong domestic demand coupled with relatively weak foreign demand put pressure on the current account deficit. The CBT lowered policy rates in order to combat increasing short-term capital inflows, while differentiating the required reserve ratios for lira deposits. This was done according to maturities, in order to slow down credit growth by raising the funding costs of the banks. The CBT has been following a very active policy in line with the increasing uncertainties in the global markets. The measures taken by the CBT are effective in decreasing the fragility of the Turkish economy. With its tightening liquidity and financial sector policies, the CBT aims to minimize risks regarding the current account deficit and inflation. At the same time, by keeping the policy rate low, the CBT is preventing a potentially hard landing. Naturally, the hike in required reserve ratios puts pressure on profitability. However, we firmly believe that the measures being implemented to slow down the economy had several negative effects on the banking sector in the short term. In the long term, sustaining financial stability is much more important than a slight decline in profitability over the course of one year. İş Bank, despite its international presence, earns the majority of its income domestically; therefore, the sustainability of growth in Turkey is critical for us. In short, İş Bank aims to maintain its position as the largest private bank in the country, while following a growth strategy consistent with the current economic policy of the national authorities.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey has steadily improved its regulatory framework for banking by introducing new regulations in diverse areas since 2001."</div><h4>What is your view of the regulatory framework for banking in Turkey, and do you anticipate further significant changes in the near future?</h4><p>Turkey has steadily improved its regulatory framework for banking by introducing new regulations in diverse areas since the 2001 crisis. The current regulatory framework ensures that the Turkish banking system complies with international standards. One of the most significant changes to be made in the near future is the transition to the Basel II framework. The change is set to occur in mid-2012, and will fundamentally alter the capital adequacy calculations of Turkish banks and may lead to the restructuring of balance sheets. Furthermore, the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) has not yet announced its schedule for the implementation of Basel III, but a gradual transition is highly anticipated in order to achieve a stronger alignment with EU directives. The new Commercial Code in 2012 is also a major reform with many implications, particularly for corporate governance issues such as transparency, management accountability, and minority rights.</p><h4>What are the bank's growth targets in the international arena?</h4><p>Our bank shapes its international presence according to the globalization of the Turkish economy, seeking to become a regional bank and positioning itself as a global player through the continuous expansion of its overseas network. In addition to our representative offices, affiliates, and branches abroad, our priority is to expand in markets with close economic and commercial ties with Turkey. In this context, we plan to take new initiatives in Georgia, Kosovo, Pakistan, and Iraq in the near future. We are also interested in launching initiatives in Azerbaijan and Egypt, where a big potential for development is present in the economy, particularly in the banking sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the impact of the euro zone crisis on the Turkish financial sector?</h4><p>During the year 2011, some of the euro zone countries have struggled with sovereign debt crises, which was something like a perfect storm. Turkey has close economic ties with Europe, especially with Germany. Despite having close links with euro zone countries, Turkey has weathered the storm quite well, just like it did during the previous episode of global financial crisis in 2008. I believe, however, that the negative impact of the crisis will be observed in 2012, and the economy will experience a “soft landing." In this context, Turkey exceeded growth expectations in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, Turkey's economy grew by 8.5%, demonstrating that the country is capable of growing as strongly as China and will experience much better GDP growth than the BRIC countries' average going forward. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve provided a large amount of liquidity to the financial system aimed at improving market conditions and supporting confidence in wider economies. It is highly probable that extra liquidity in the Western financial system may improve the situation there and, also, have a positive impact on emerging markets in the form of fund inflows.</p><h4>How effective were the 2001 banking reforms for state banks such as Halkbank?</h4><p>In the aftermath of the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey, we established the best supervision system of its kind—the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). Both the functions of regulation and supervision have been equally focused on by the BRSA over the last decade, and it has manifested itself through banking reform and restructuring. The state banks were particular victims of the financial crisis in 2001. They incurred heavy losses and were deprived of capital during this crisis. Post-crisis restructuring made these banks much more effective in terms of adherence to market practices. Previously, the state banks were subject to public law, and they now enjoy private legislation. Only after new regulations and a restructuring process could the state banks compete with their private peers. More competition in the financial system made it much more resilient. Additionally, there have also been some newly adopted regulations that required banks to collect much more capital and liquidity, abolishing bad lending practices at the same time. More prudent and conservative policies were also adopted by the BRSA to prevent currency mismatches in the financial system. The Basel Committee on Banking is currently updating its approach toward capital requirements. The BRSA has always been cautious in terms of capital, and this strategy paid off, especially during and after the global financial crisis.</p><div class="quote">“Many of our SME customers have grown, and are now categorized as commercial or corporate enterprises."</div><h4>Halkbank has a strong history of serving tradesmen, artisans, and SMEs. What trends can you identify with regards to business growth?</h4><p>Halkbank was established in 1938 with the mission of providing services to SMEs, including artisans and craftsmen. We have focused on this segment for more than 70 years, and now the Halkbank brand is associated with SME businesses. The share of SME loans at Halkbank weighs in at 36%, whereas the industry average is 24%. The SME share has decreased, however, due to the substantial growth in overall lending activities in the last couple of years. Many of our SME customers have grown, and are now categorized as commercial or corporate enterprises. We continue to focus on the SME segment—99% of companies in Turkey are considered SMEs, and employment and exports are very much reliant on this segment. We are well positioned as an SME bank; we focus on growth and have an extensive geographic distribution network. Moreover, Halkbank is much better represented in rural areas, where conditions have improved significantly as there are good indicators that income distribution has also improved around the country. We have registered much higher growth due to our proximity to SMEs.</p><h4>What new products does Halkbank offer to increase competition and efficiency?</h4><p>Turkey suffers from a long-lasting current account deficit issue and also a scarcity of savings. We, as financial players, feel obliged to address these problems. Turkey is heavily dependent on energy imports, and that creates a huge bill that swells the deficit. In one way or another, we need to reduce our dependency on energy imports. We are marketing a loan product with favorable conditions for our customer base, which consequently reduces energy consumption and increases energy savings. In this context, we enjoy close collaboration with international financial institutions such as the European Investment Bank, World Bank, and French Development Agency. We are in receipt of a number of loan facilities from these institutions and we are utilizing these funds in servicing our SME customer needs. We are now marketing a variety of loan products and services aimed at supporting energy efficient investment. We believe green energy is also crucial for us and deserves support. Turkey enjoys a huge amount of sun, and it is logical that solar energy could well be a substitute for fossil fuel resources. We are doing our part in terms of energy efficiency and renewable energy, by introducing new concepts to the market segments we are involved with. Fortunately, we have sufficient funding available at the moment.</p><h4>Does this include increased risk evaluation for capital-intensive renewable energy exploration and production activities?</h4><p>The projects are limited to a few hundred million dollars. To reduce the current account deficit of the country and to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, we need to increase our investment base, which means we must make larger investments in wind and geothermal energy as well, as they necessitate much more capital and finance. We are also working on attracting investments from international markets that will allow us to undertake a much more aggressive marketing strategy.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for international SMEs to work with Halkbank?</h4><p>We have always advised our customers to engage in mergers and acquisitions, to utilize their resources more efficiently, and to maintain sustainable growth prospects. We have always encouraged the partnerships of local and international firms. Joint ventures between international and Turkish SMEs are highly encouraged. One issue I would like to raise is that foreign companies look for opportunities in relatively larger cities, but there exist some regions that are really underpenetrated, offering plenty of advantages. I encourage new firms to penetrate the unsaturated regions of the country—such as Gaziantep, Denizli, and Konya—where there are very good incentives for partnership activities. My advice for new firms would be to seek opportunities outside of the larger cities.</p><h4>What is the current appetite for foreign investment in the Turkish banking sector?</h4><p>Foreign investment participation in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) comprises approximately 63%, and has been range-bound for years. When it comes to the banking sector, foreign appetite is much higher. Halkbank launched an IPO in 2007, with approximately 25% of the shares listed on the ISE. Roughly 70% of the shares were allocated to foreign investors, and after the IPO, the foreign share of investors peaked at about 94% or 95%. As of today, the figure stands at 88%, demonstrating the robust foreign appetite. This is largely due to the low penetration level of the banking sector and the young age of the country, which makes it attractive for investors. Halkbank is one of the best in its class, performing exceptionally well over the course of the past few years. In 2009, we had a return on equity (ROE) of 32.5%, one of the highest figures throughout the world. We achieved an ROE of 30.5% and 25.4% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, placing us substantially ahead of our peers, which is why foreign investors are happy to invest in Halkbank.</p><h4>What are you expecting for 2012?</h4><p>We are expecting at least 15% asset growth, 18% loan growth, and at least 10% earnings growth. We expect the Turkish economy to grow at about 4% with inflation of about 6%-7%. In this environment, I believe that our targets can be easily achieved.</p><h4>What are your aspirations for the international banking sector?</h4><p>We are striving to increase our international presence. We have a 30% share of Demir-Halk Bank, operating in the Netherlands, as well as an offshore banking unit in Bahrain that we hope to expand. Other opportunities may open up in the Gulf region, but more importantly we have acquired 98% of a bank in Skopje, Macedonia, which has 21 branches, and we are currently working on a merger with Ziraat Bank Skopje, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012. The Balkan region provides cultural and geographic proximity, and therefore we are planning to expand our operations in other parts of the Balkans; Skopje is just the beginning. We are seeking more opportunities in the region. We will be capitalizing on our strengths in the SME segment, and exporting this success abroad.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is TÜSİAD's strategy to ensure a sustainable Turkey by 2050?</h4><p>The Turkish economy has been moving toward the top ranks of the world economies since the beginning of the 21st century, and has set the goal of being amongst the top 10 world economies by 2023. This goal can only be accomplished through sustainable development policies. In order to implement the sustainable development vision, a platform for dialogue must be established by creating awareness among all members of society, such as the state, civil society, and the business world. The business community, which already possesses the know-how, technology, skills, financial resources, and necessary means for spreading sustainable development principles to society, has a significant role to play in leading the sustainable development vision to success. Therefore, the sustainable development vision cannot be achieved without the inclusion of the business world in a participatory process. TÜSİAD attaches special importance to sustainability and has thereby launched the “Vision 2050 Turkey" project, aiming to shed light on the next 40 years with a vision of sustainable development. The first phase of this project was preparing the “Vision 2050 Turkey" report, which provides a universal coverage and assessment of sustainability issues from the perspective of businesses and other stakeholders. The report develops recommendations for the achievement of a sustainable Turkey by 2050 and assesses Turkey's future opportunities as well as the potential risks that may arise along the way. Entrepreneurs who foresee these opportunities will gain a competitive advantage. We believe that increasing the awareness of the business world, and especially focusing on the opportunities of sustainability, is crucially important. In light of this striking fact, TÜSİAD will continue to work on issues pertaining to sustainability. The “Vision 2050 Turkey" project will be enhanced with studies on “Energy Efficiency in Buildings," “Sustainable Tourism," and “Mobility" in 2012, and “Energy Efficiency in Industry" and “Sustainable Agriculture" in 2013 and beyond.</p><h4>Turkey's business and investment environment and processes are ranked highly. What needs to be done to improve the ranking further for new international investors?</h4><p>Law and policy making should be conducted with a participatory approach. By providing that participation, public policies will be better designed and much more internalized. However, lately we have been encountering overnight changes in legislation or insufficient consultation processes, creating an unstable and unpredictable investment environment. On the other hand, the most obvious obstacle to establishing fair competition in the Turkish economy is its informal economy. In order to increase efficiency and competitiveness in the economy, as well as to improve the investment climate by preventing unfair competition and support sustainable growth, fighting against informality is a sine qua non in Turkey. We believe that a social consensus on the fight against informality should be strengthened. The establishment of consensus between organizations and society is necessary to fight against informality. Specifically, Turkey ranks low on permits. There are efforts to simplify the permit procedures, but red tape still seems to be one of the most important challenges.</p><h4>What are the most significant constraints to growth for Turkish businesses?</h4><p>While strong growth and a sound fiscal stance are Turkey's strengths, the widening current account deficit is the soft spot. More specifically, for a long time, Turkey's weakness is its structural trade deficit. With a relatively low level of savings, its growth is dependent upon the availability of foreign savings. Turkey is a net energy importer—energy imports account for roughly two-thirds of the trade deficit—and the manufacturing industry is mainly import dependent, while the current account inevitably reflects GDP growth.</p><h4>How important would Turkey's accession to the EU be?</h4><p>Turkey, Europe, and the world will experience important changes in the forthcoming period. In this perspective, the EU itself has the challenge of enhancing its global economic competitiveness, institutional efficiency, political integrity, and democratic credibility. Each of these points will be strengthened with the accession of Turkey.</p><div class="quote">“While strong growth and a sound fiscal stance are Turkey's strengths, the widening current account deficit is the soft spot."</div><h4>How would you assess government measures to address the current account deficit?</h4><p>Although there is still a long way to go in terms of fixing structural weaknesses, massive GDP growth rates above 8% per annum in 2010 and 2011 placed Turkey as one of the top growth countries in the world after fast growers like China and Argentina. However, in the existing macroeconomic framework, high growth rates have some costs, especially in terms of the current account balance and, naturally, the savings-investment balance. Until the Turkish economy finds a way to shift into higher value-added exports, the most credible way to smooth the business cycle and slow down the widening of the current account deficit in the short term is to formulate the right macroeconomic policy mix that helps the rebalancing of demand, while focusing on structural reforms. In the medium to long term, high and sustainable growth rates require substantial structural reforms to improve productivity and enhance competitiveness.</p><h4>What are the most important changes to the Turkish Commercial Code that foreign investors should be aware of?</h4><p>The new Commercial Code brings a whole new structure to the business world; therefore, several articles that both foreign and local investors should be aware of can be underlined. The new Turkish Commercial Code is based on the corporate governance approach. The regulations parallel to the corporate governance principles regarding transparency, management, and control mechanisms will definitely improve the business and investment environment in Turkey for foreign investors. The new Commercial Code requires at least one board member to be a Turkish citizen and resident in Turkey. This means that a new Turkish member must be appointed to the board of directors if all the board members of the company are currently foreign. Secondly, the new code allows for “one-man companies." The former code, which remains in force until July 1, 2012, requires at least five shareholders both for limited and incorporated companies. In other words, the main shareholders will not be obliged to distribute small amounts of shares to establish a limited or incorporated company. “One man" can also be a legal entity. The new code will set out a more transparent business world both for local and foreign investors. We believe that the regulatory framework is crucial to improve the business and investment environment in Turkey. Therefore, we have strongly supported the enactment of the Turkish Commercial Code and continue our support for secondary legislation. We believe that there is still room for improvement in legislation of this magnitude. For that reason, we continue to work on our position in the due process.</p><h4>What sort of regulatory changes still need to be made to improve the business environment in Turkey?</h4><p>Unemployment still ranks as one of the top priorities in Turkey. In order to fight unemployment, the burdens on employment should be decreased further. Decreasing non-wage labor costs will also contribute to efforts to integrate the informal economy into the formal economy. In order to satisfy this objective, we believe that efforts aimed at decreasing non-wage labor costs and increasing the transition to a formal economy should be implemented simultaneously. On the other hand, laws regulating work life should be consistent with and respond to the needs of the labor force. Flexible working methods, which were included in the revised Labor Law in 2003, are not common in practice. The “flexicurity" approach can contribute to the maintenance and improvement of employment, the reduction of the informal economy, and the creation of jobs for specific groups like women, the young, and the disabled. TÜSİAD believes that the components of the intellectual property system are powerful tools to capture the value of creativity and knowledge to promote economic and cultural development. Intellectual property rights (IPR) are regulated by decree laws in Turkey. In July 2009, the Constitutional Court decided that the penal provisions of trademarks cannot be regulated by decree laws and annulled the related articles. The Constitutional Court provided a six-month term to enact the penal provisions. The defined period passed and no legislative action had been taken, hence, thousands of trademark cases were nullified. The Constitutional Court has taken a similar decision for patents and industrial designs, and this time has provided a one-year term to enact the related laws. This term will be over by June, 6 2010 and thousands of cases will be nullified. There are attempts to draft these laws, but these draft laws fall short of protecting IPR and are weakening the seriousness of the penalties. Turkey needs coherent and harmonized IPR legislation.</p><h4>Turkey is vulnerable to stress in international financial markets as a result of its current account deficit. What steps should be taken to increase FDI to combat this?</h4><p>We believe, at TÜSİAD, Turkey's dynamic growth prospects and rapidly developing investment environment will attract more FDI in the coming years, and the energy, real estate, infrastructure, consumer, and financial sectors show strong potential. Addressing structural issues such as labor market rigidities and labor skill mismatches, fighting against the informal economy, improving the tax system, transitioning to green growth, and fostering the environment for entrepreneurship and innovation are our top priorities, and we think they will seemingly keep their places in the long term.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the economy over 2011?</h4><p>We predict that the final results for 2011 will reveal GDP growth 6% over the same figure for 2010. The result can be put down to many reasons. One of these reasons is the high price of oil. The average price per barrel that Ecuador sold on the international market was $94.88. That was 36% higher than the price in 2010. There was also a lot of public investment injected into the economy, especially in infrastructure and construction, through credits given by the Social Security Bank. It invested around $626 million in 2011 in housing. There has also been increased credit released in order to activate the private sector. Hundreds of millions of dollars were given to the private sector to be used for private investment and working capital. There has also been growth in the credit issued by private banks in the country—19% higher than 2010—and this increased household consumption. Ecuadorean exports have also increased. The price of commodities and raw materials has risen over the past few years. Ecuador has also been using resources for public expenses by raising taxes. Tax revenues rose 9.1% in 2011. Those are the main reasons that the construction sector and household consumption sectors grew so much in 2011. Industry increased 6.2%, mainly showing growth in beverages, wood, and textile manufacturing. Mining had growth of 4.5%; agriculture also grew. And all this is what made so much economic growth possible.</p><h4>What are the Chamber of Industries' main goals for 2012?</h4><p>We have to be very careful about the future, and predict the factors producing our expected results. Internally, we believe that there will be higher inflation that could affect household consumption. This would be an effect of the new tax laws, which will add to the cost of production and thereby raise the prices of products and affect consumer purchasing power. Household consumption plays the most important role in the growth of the economy, and it is one of the things we are very concerned about. The anti-monopoly law is also very worrisome for us. The government may begin to implement price controls due to possible rising costs. If the government starts controlling prices, it may affect industry.</p><div class="quote">“We explain to foreign investors where to invest, what to invest in, and what the advantages are of investing in Ecuador."</div><h4>Another major player this year will be government. How much money do you anticipate it will inject into the economy?</h4><p>It depends on worldwide oil prices. One of the main things that might change oil prices is how the European crisis will be resolved. If Europe reduces its demand for oil, it will cause a problem for prices. The amount of money that the government will be able to invest depends on this. Our foreign trade policy will also make an impact. We have duty preferences with the US and EU until 2013. If these agreements do not evolve into free trade agreements, 82% of what the US or Europe purchases will come from our neighbors. If they don't see Ecuador as a stable country in the long run, exporting with no duties to other countries, they will seek a different supplier. In a dollarized economy, it will be a severe outcome. However, we expect our economy to grow 5.35% in 2012, based on conversations we have had with the Central Bank and the government. The IMF expects 3.8%.</p><h4>What measures will the Chamber of Industries take in order to soften the potential risks?</h4><p>If there is liquidity in the system, the economy will be dynamic, and the Chamber will take advantage of this positive development. There are some industries that will have a high capacity to latch onto that increase, but some industries in different sectors will suffer. We are largely prepared so far. The peak investment of industry depends on the stability of the market. We know that an economic boom could be temporary, but we have to plan for the long run. We can't recover domestic or foreign investments in the short run, and it's tied to economic policy. We have high hopes for the food, textile, plastic, and construction sectors in 2012. They are definitely prepared for growth. Our ambassador is going to Washington to discuss agreements with the US market. This will be absolutely relevant for Ecuador's investors.</p><h4>What are the key challenges for the public and private sectors?</h4><p>We want both sectors to be headed in the same direction for Ecuador's production matrix. Having clear dialogues about how new policies affect production and how economic growth is happening in less populated areas is important. We would like to increase production in the areas with no development, and we have to work together to make this happen. The Ecuador-EU agreement is one of the most important tools we have to work with. In Manabí­, one-third of jobs are related to exports to the EU, and we have to maintain that. We aim to lead dialogues on increasing cluster possibilities, improving confidence in the private sector, internationalizing SMEs, and attracting foreign investment. This will further integrate Ecuador into the global economy.</p><h4>What are some of the projects the Chamber has been working on with the Ministry of Industry and Productivity of Ecuador (MIPRO)?</h4><p>Ecuador Industrial was the most successful project we carried out in 2011. It was a national conference where medium and large companies in industry and commerce gathered to buy products, services, and parts from SMEs. We were able to transfer technological advantages and knowledge between companies of all sizes, and enable small companies to find credit from public and private banks. MIPRO played a major role by helping companies meet standards of excellence. Large companies were able to learn about formality, delivery time, and quality. We encouraged those companies to be more formal and transparent. We also substituted $74.2 million worth of exports in those two days, while giving business to local SMEs. We also have a lot of social responsibility projects, separate from MIPRO. We are also building the System for Labor Integration (SIL) to get people with disabilities into the economy. We are offering training courses and preparing them to be a part of the workforce with equal conditions.</p><h4>What should companies know before investing in Ecuador?</h4><p>They have to learn the organic production code. There are three things that make the Ecuadorean market attractive: legal safeguards, a tax package, and the geographical location of the market. The production code offers a tax package, but the laws are being reformed. The first thing I can suggest is to take a look at the production code and understand it fully, because that is what Ecuador can offer today.</p><h4>What does the Chamber of Industries of Guayaquil offer to foreign investors interested in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are the bridge between the private sector and the government. We explain to foreign investors where to invest, what to invest in, and what the advantages are of investing in Ecuador. We also advise them on who to invest with, and encourage them to talk openly with the government, in case the government needs their investment specifically.</p><h4>What is the profile of your members?</h4><p>Commerce and media firms are members of the chamber, in addition to industry. There are a lot of sectors of the economy that can join the Chamber. The only requirement is to be a company that runs an ethical business. We are more than happy to have a law-abiding, ethical member to support. We have 750 members in our Chamber, and our members represent 40% of what the country produces, 42% of industrial assets, 30% of total employment in the manufacturing sector, and approximately 45% of the total taxes paid in Ecuador. We also represent more than 40% of the trademarks designed in this country.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Philips in the Middle East and the significance of Dubai in terms of your regional operations?</h4><p>We have been in the region for more than 50 years, and we truly believe in the potential of Dubai and the UAE as a market, and even more as a regional hub for Philips in the Middle East. We manage 14 countries from our regional headquarters in Dubai, focused on diversified businesses such as health care, consumer lifestyle, and lighting. We also see Dubai as a gateway to expansion into other parts of the region, as Dubai enjoys a neutral position, representing “the Switzerland" of the Middle East. It is also well equipped to serve different areas. The Emirate is also progressive and innovative in its approach to business and growth. This attracts companies such as Philips, which centers its efforts on meaningful innovation. We also have regional hubs in Beirut, Riyadh, and Istanbul. These bases all fall under the umbrella of Dubai. At its core, Philips is focused on innovation, and Dubai offers the perfect combination of innovation and location, aligned with development in the region and the UAE.</p><h4>What major trends have you observed for Philips in terms of health care in 2011?</h4><p>We have picked up on a couple of trends, such as the need for more private involvement, for example through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Another was to design more “one-stop shops," which are full of solutions that cover full-care cycles, or go from awareness creation up to after care and long-term maintenance. Currently, we've been working closely with governmental and private players in the healthcare sector, providing education, cutting edge solutions for hospitals, and services ranging from financial, maintenance, productivity improvement, as well as knowledge brokering. The healthcare system needs to evolve beyond the government perspective, and we need to take ownership by inviting new partners, and luckily Dubai is leading this trend. As for the one-stop-shop approach, we are seeking real solutions that encompass the health and wellbeing sectors as a whole. We are considering how to tie the different segments together in order to foster a productive workflow; different components from public awareness to aftercare are part of this plan for a value-added service. For example, over the last few years, Philips has invested resources into tackling the growing problems of obesity and diabetes, leading to cardiac diseases in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. In 2010, the Philips Center for Health and Well-being released its UAE Health and Well-being Report, which showed alarming trends not only in the rising numbers of overweight and obese people, but also in the lack of understanding that this posed a significant threat to overall health. While only 25% of men and 28% of women in the UAE consider themselves overweight, figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that in actual fact 67% of men and 72% of women are overweight. Other numbers showed that only 32% are concerned about being obese, 16% are concerned about high cholesterol, and merely 13% are concerned about high sugar and diabetes, while the actual percentage of children who are obese range in different regional studies from 40% to 50%. One of the primary conclusions of the Philips Health and Well-being Report was that there was a lack of knowledge in the country about what steps can be taken to tackle weight gain and weight management problems, and since healthy living and eating are one of the key factors to the solution of such health issues, Philips developed consumer products that are both environmentally friendly and health conscious, strongly adding value toward prevention. For example, we know that almost everybody loves French fries, which can now be fried using up to 80% less fat, using the patented AirFryer technology compared to the conventional fryer. Solving medical problems does not only revolve around creating public awareness, but also includes medical professionals and healthcare customer education and following up on patients. For example, we are also looking at home healthcare as a growing trend in the region. However, there are some structural issues in terms of getting the right medical professionals to provide the necessary services.</p><div class="quote">“We are the largest player in terms of lighting throughout the world, almost twice as big as the second largest company."</div><h4>Is sustainability attracting more attention in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The “green" hospital trend is starting to grow. Looking at the hospitals from a purely care perspective as well as their footprint on society, developers are beginning to find ways to make everything greener. Hospitals must decide which infrastructure can increase energy efficiency, for example, choosing the right type of lighting from the start that can significantly reduce their electricity bills. Philips aims to start tackling these challenges at an early stage, while the infrastructure is being built, instead of retrofitting solutions when hospitals already exist. There are a variety of opportunities in the region, as many new structures and hospitals are being developed, and at the first moment that construction begins on a new hospital, directors seek the best solutions from a green perspective, with more sustainable innovations. With our help, there will be less energy usage and very attractive total cost of ownership; a financially viable proposition.</p><h4>What potential exists for Dubai to become a regional hub for medical excellence?</h4><p>Dubai is very adept at embracing innovative approaches. The healthcare system works toward the application of the latest technology and the sharing of knowledge. For example, the Saudi German Hospital, a recently built leading hospital in Dubai, is a facility that is fully equipped with Philips' technology and innovations. We bring in our global knowledge and experience. Our clinical specialists provide application training to help enhance clinical output using the latest technology. Furthermore, the infrastructure at the Jebel Ali Free Zone functions as a logistical hub and a gateway for our equipment that enters the sub-continent. Many of our service operations are being built here to strengthen our presence, and the innovative aspects of our operations are strongly tied to Dubai, and the rest of the region's agenda, as the Emirate is positioned and profiled as a service provider.</p><h4>High oil prices across the globe are driving up the costs of energy. How is Philips developing new products to balance that trend?</h4><p>Lighting accounts for approximately 19% of the world's energy bill, and an even larger percentage of the energy bill in the Gulf. We are the largest player in terms of lighting throughout the world, almost twice as big as the second largest company. Philips is often quoted as “providing the most light after the sun." Our innovations are a major contributor to the energy footprint, and we are working to become even more efficient. For example, if consumers switch all their current lighting systems to LED lighting, they could easily save 40%-60%, and sometimes even up to 80% of their current energy usage, without giving up or losing the quality of light. Combined with the long-term benefits that LED has to offer, with a lifetime of over 25 years, there are a myriad of advantages for a more reduced footprint over time. Philips is heavily investing in the technology to make this a reality, as well as apply it practically to day-to-day life. There are existing buildings for which we can conduct energy audits and carry out an assessment of the energy footprint, whether a government or a private building. We also provide consultancy in terms of how to reduce energy use through various solutions that we provide. In addition to LED technology, we offer a variety of energy-efficient systems to all our customers, including the public and private sectors. Another area for which we take responsibility is monitoring and establishing standards and regulations in the lighting field. We took the initiative to establish a lighting association for the region, which was not yet in existence. Currently, we are in the final stages of that process, and it will be active soon. A Philips representative will be the first president of the group.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ICA evolved since it was established in 1947?</h4><p>ICA is a public company originally founded by my grandfather, and there has always been a family influence. There is a strong tradition in our family of promoting infrastructure projects, which my grandfather was very skilled at. He was the first Mexican civil engineer that was able to build and create a team large enough to take on huge infrastructure projects for the country. Before his time, foreign companies tended to lead these projects. With a team of young engineers, he was able to build a group based on partnerships. Many of the engineers would become partners and hold stock in the company. That was a way to ensure that their incentives were aligned with the prosperity of the company. Our company has never been a one-man show; in order to build these huge projects, we have needed many engineers. My grandfather was able to establish and lead this group, becoming the most important infrastructure company in the country. Since its inception, ICA has been a very important tool for the government to develop and promote the infrastructure Mexico has needed. Part of our curriculum is the construction of most of the subway system in Mexico City. For 20 years, there had been no investments in the subway. In this new era, my generation is taking on renovation projects. For example, we were in charge of building the drainage system in the 1970s in Mexico City, and now we are extending the system to double its capacity. We have been able to maintain this reputation and image of a capable engineering firm by delivering complex projects that Mexico has benefitted from. We have been key to the development of the country. However, there have been some changes. At the beginning of ICA's activities, these projects were carried out through a government “pay-as-you-go" plan. Now, ICA is truly an integrator of projects; we build, but we also structure financing and innovate new ways of contracting, to put less stress on government resources. A company like ours is not only a builder, but is also a large sponsor. There has been huge progress in this sense, and much of the infrastructure is now private. For example, we own and operate 13 airports, a number of road concessions, and many water projects over the long term. We built these projects, but we also committed to operating the infrastructure, for periods of 20, 25, or 50 years, in the case of airports. Very recently, a law covering public-private partnerships (PPPs) was approved. This law is working toward forming better partnerships between the private sector and the government. For a private player like ICA, the law means having a more transparent view of the long term and partnerships with the government, as well as incentives to bring together funds and invest our capital in long-term infrastructure projects.</p><h4>Are there any particular areas that ICA would like to expand into?</h4><p>This company is 65 years old, and we have worked in almost every sector, building roads, airports, tunnels, bridges, and even gas pipelines and oil platforms. We have an almost 18-year-old partnership with Fluor Corporation of the US, which helps us target projects from PEMEX, such as oil refineries, platforms, and combined-cycle power plants. This work is not simple civil construction, but engineering procurement and construction (EPC) work. We would like to expand through that into EPC work, for example, in the mining sector. We have just begun work with mining companies, and we expect future growth in that business. In addition, PEMEX has always been a large client, and is undergoing a transformation process. Even though the company is not fully open, which would make us more competitive as a country, it is changing. There are more gas pipeline concessions now, and we have the chance to evaluate how to get more involved in the business. We see a variety of work from PEMEX on the horizon, with more upstream projects such as on- and offshore oil pipeline work.</p><div class="quote">“ICA is currently engineering a seventh refinery in Mexico, as well as expanding the existing six facilities."</div><h4>What projects do you think have had the most significant impact in Mexico?</h4><p>La Yesca Dam is definitely one of the most important renewable energy projects. Another is the construction of one the longest water tunnels, which will be part of the drainage system in Mexico City and stretches 60 kilometers across the region. We still face the challenge of floods, and the capacity of the drainage system we built in the city in the 1970s was appropriate for a population of 7 million or 8 million. With the population more than tripling since then, we realized the need for expansion. To carry out the construction, we have acquired six tunnel-boring machines, which are approximately 100 meters long and 12 meters wide. This equipment is mainly used for drilling. The project will continue for six years, and we are two years into it already. We will probably finish the first 10 kilometers in 2012. Although it won't be totally finished, we can expect to put a number of completed sections into use in late 2012. At the end of the 60-kilometer tunnel, we are building the largest water treatment plant in Latin America—and one of the largest in the world—which is a long-term concession that will be able to treat all the water at the end of the tunnel, which is fairly emblematic. The project is being carried out in partnership with Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en America Latina (IDEAL), an investment agency focused on the development and employment of Latin Americans.</p><h4>Which countries is ICA considering for international expansion and why?</h4><p>We are looking at Panama, Peru, and Costa Rica. These countries are all becoming more stable, investment grade companies with good economies and no deficits, like the Mexico of seven or eight years ago. These countries are beginning to demand the kind of projects we have carried out in Mexico, such as hydropower dams, roads, water tunnels, and subway systems. We believe that we can bring experience to these countries that are drafting their infrastructure plans. These areas are a good place to find work, and we have developed a good reputation in some of these countries, such as Panama, where we have built major roads. We are receiving new road projects in Panama, and mining projects in Peru. We also foresee the expansion of many ports, and we are involved in the expansion of the Panama Canal. As the canal receives larger boats, the widening of the canal has sparked the rebuilding of ports. In fact, much of our recent investments have been directed toward ports, both in Mexico and in Panama.</p><h4>To what extent does ICA cooperate with the Ministry of Communications and Transport?</h4><p>We are very active with the Ministry. For example, we collaborate heavily on our airport projects, and the master plan for the airport business has to be approved by the Ministry. Moreover, how much we can charge the airlines is regulated, and it depends on our investment plans. We also cooperate in terms of roads. ICA is building many roads that will become concessions, and our cooperation with the Ministry does not end when the project is finished; we work together for the life of the concession. We do most of our work with the Ministry solely due to the sheer size of the projects. Through our airport group, we own commercial spaces in Terminal 2 at Mexico City International Airport. There is an NH Hotel, which we are responsible for. The airport business is two fold; one is the regulating business, which is charged to the airlines, and the other is commercial, such as the way the airport interior is utilized.</p><h4>How do you assess Mexico's infrastructure needs?</h4><p>There has been very heavy investment in roads, but there remains room for growth. Very little has been done in terms of port connectivity. PEMEX has a long way to go. ICA is currently engineering a seventh refinery in Mexico, as well as expanding the existing six facilities. We are involved in the building of the new refinery, but we believe that PEMEX must go deeper in terms of offshore drilling. There has been increased activity, and we expect to see even more investments in the oil industry in the coming years. Renewable energy is another sector that needs diversification. We do have hydropower projects, but there are many opportunities in wind power. There are more renewable energy projects on the horizon. Mexico's demographics are driving the country to increase development: more cities, airports, roads, and housing. We are awaiting new infrastructure plans from the government, which may choose to invest around $45 billion per year in infrastructure. This figure could increase to $60 billion or $70 billion as water drainage projects take priority throughout the country.</p><h4>How was ICA's financial performance in 2011 compared to the previous year?</h4><p>We grew more than 15% in sales, and around 40% in earnings before depreciation and amortization (EBDA). ICA has a huge pipeline of projects in its backlog—the year 2011 was excellent for the company. We have been growing, and with our international expansion and the government's infrastructure plans, we are anticipating very interesting years to come.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of ICA?</h4><p>The ICA of the future will boast even better engineering in its projects. We hope to be leaner in assets and quicker on returns. The company will be younger and even more dynamic, with very motivated engineers and top project managers. Through the ICA Foundation, we will encourage more students to study engineering. Without a doubt, our international presence will increase.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the banking sector's loan portfolio, deposit base, and asset growth in 2011?</h4><p>In 2011 the banking sector showed a positive trend of development. Issued credit grew by 15.7%, the deposit base by 14.3%, and assets by 6.5%. Despite these figures, the problem of loan portfolio quality persists. Credits to the economy could have grown at a higher rate, but the large share of non-performing loans (NPLs)—around 30%—in the banking sector mitigated such growth. In order to solve this problem, a set of measures were adopted by the government and National Bank that were intended to remediate the balance sheets of the banks. On the one hand, amendments were made to the tax legislation that proposed deductions of income on the recovery of provisions from taxable income when writing off bad loans. On the other hand, a concept for the improvement of bank asset quality was developed, which suggests the use of a centralized and decentralized approach in the process of remediation for bank balance sheets. As part of its implementation, the National Bank established a special purpose vehicle (SPV), the Problem Loans Fund, which will be buying up the troubled bank assets and taking action to restore their quality. The concept also suggests that SPVs would be established with a view to buy out bad quality assets and take actions to restore their value by the banks themselves, which is a decentralized approach. In connection with the implementation of these measures, in 2012 we can expect that the quality of the credit portfolio for the majority of large- and medium-sized banks will improve.</p><h4>In 2011 the financial system underwent structural changes, which increased the regulatory weight of the National Bank. How do you assess the impacts of the decision so far?</h4><p>In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 61 dated April 18, 2011, the functions of the Agency for the Regional Financial Center of Almaty (RFCA) and the Agency for Regulation and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations (AFN) were consolidated under the National Bank. This concentration of control of the financial system in the hands of the National Bank is consistent with international practice. A similar practice is observed in the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore, and Bahrain. The task of Almaty becoming a regional financial center does not entail only the development of the stock market and the provision of services by brokerage firms, as it was until today. Our task is more global; to develop the infrastructure of the entire city. While achieving this task, it is important to coordinate all government agencies, primarily the Almaty Municipality. And of course, the role and status of the National Bank, whose structure now also includes the Development Committee of the RFCA, is much higher than it was at the now defunct agency. The target indicated by the President is to become one of the top-10 financial centers in Asia by 2020. The committee fully inherited the tasks, functions, and powers of the abolished agency. However, with the transfer of structures to the National Bank, more opportunities have appeared to help realize the set tasks. The reorganization stage is complete and the committee is working on a new concept of development at the RFCA, taking into account the changed conditions and new opportunities. To date, we have identified three main activities for the committee: the provision of public services, improving financial literacy, and the development of Islamic finance.</p><div class="quote">“The National Bank plans to introduce Basel III requirements starting from 2013."</div><h4>The IMF has noted that “the ongoing vulnerabilities in Kazakhstan's banking system are a cause for concern." How do you evaluate the IMF's statement?</h4><p>The IMF's concern is related to major problems in Kazakhstan's banking system, including a low-quality credit portfolio and the low credit activity of the banks. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that 2011 marked the start of a positive trend of development in the banking sector. After three years of stagnation the banks began to show growth in credit activity. Moreover, the 14.3% growth in the deposit base indicates the maintenance of trust in the banking system. In regard to systemically important financial institutions and the whole banking sector, the National Bank plans to introduce Basel III requirements starting from 2013, despite the fact that the capital requirements are higher than those used in the Customs Union, the EU, and the US. This step will allow for a strengthening of the resilience of bank capital, and will contribute to financial stability in the banking sector.</p><h4>How is monetary policy shaping up to support the country's development goals?</h4><p>The National Bank will support the country's macroeconomic development plans within its competence, such as from the standpoint of ensuring the money supply growth rate and encouraging adequate economic development. In this case, given that the priority for the National Bank is price stability, the conduct of monetary policy is carried out so that the monetary component is at an optimum level and does not provide additional inflationary pressures. In the medium term, the President has set an important task—to achieve 7% growth in the economy. Already, state agencies have developed the necessary measures to achieve this target. Furthermore, it should be noted that during the design and implementation of economic policy, the government and the National Bank will take into account all the risks that could adversely affect the macro-economic development of Kazakhstan. The present government and the National Bank are working to develop a set of policy measures aimed at ensuring social stability, the stability of the financial sector, the provision of low inflation, and the stability of the tenge.</p><h4>What implications does the state strategy for the National Oil Fund's utilization have for local and foreign investors?</h4><p>The President instructed that the means of the National Oil Fund should be invested in the internal development of the country and the diversification of the domestic economy. There is much work to be done, including identifying which industries require large investments. A way then needs to be found to transition from strategic planning to specific projects, with verified feasibility studies supported by full cost calculations. Prior to this, it is impossible to talk about the exact amount of investment from the National Oil Fund for this purpose. At the same time, I would like to clarify that in accordance with the current concept formation and use of the National Oil Fund's means, the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 962 dated April 2, 2010, established a minimum balance of 20% of the forecasted value of GDP at the end of the financial year. The National Bank supports the focus of the National Investment Fund. Economic diversification and the development of non-oil sectors are of strategic importance to Kazakhstan.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>White goods and consumer electronics exports have been expanding massively over the past decade. Is this growth sustainable in the long term?</h4><p>Yes, it is sustainable. Good export potential based on technologies that occur in some sub-sectors bears great importance for the evaluation and diversification of the country's exports. Turkey is a good manufacturing base for these kinds of products. There are a lot of suppliers around and it is a very competitive field. Therefore, I expect growth is going to continue at that growth rate.</p><h4>What makes Turkey so competitive?</h4><p>Due to its geographical location Turkey can provide an advantage for emerging economies. Moreover, the supply chain is very strong. There are a lot of small companies producing parts for it so the base is very strong. As a result, it is an accelerating product area.</p><div class="quote">“The importance of Turkish goods in the international market place is growing, and this fact is undeniable."</div><h4>Given this strength, do you foresee more Turkish brands competing with the more internationally recognized technological brands?</h4><p>All of them should do well in Turkey—by themselves or as part of joint ventures, whether project based or agreement based. Those that came before, such as Bosch and Merloni, are very happy. They are expanding. They've shut down their factories in Europe and are increasing their production capacity in Turkey. I'm sure many other companies will follow, and if they do not follow, then they will form project-based agreements with other companies.</p><h4>How is Vestel looking to further launch its own branded goods in early 2012?</h4><p>We are very interested in local brands. We will probably continue buying those brands. When there is an opportunity, we will be there. In the last three months, we bought three brands from the UK. In that regard, we don't know what the future will bring.</p><h4>Would you say the UK is one of your main target markets?</h4><p>European countries are our main markets. Nearly 70% of our export sales are carried out in these countries. Nevertheless, everywhere is our target—the Middle East, CIS, Russia, Europe, and North Africa for white goods. As for brown goods, the US will be added to this list.</p><h4>Are you facing any competition from other emerging markets?</h4><p>Once you reach a certain volume, competition is important, but your efficiency is much more important than that. I think we are in a strong position so we don't fear these emerging countries.</p><h4>Vestel has a very strong reputation for R&amp;D, launching the first plasma-screen TV in Turkey. How do you evaluate the government's plan to promote innovation within Turkey?</h4><p>There a lot of countries where the government provides incentives for R&amp;D. Making new investments, and the expansion of existing investments are beneficial for the country. Investment has been increasing year by year. This rate was 1% of GDP in 2010, and 3% in 2011. This is directly related to the government's input. Since income is increasing now, and the government has also seen the effects of R&amp;D on exports, it is putting in much more effort than before behind supporting companies' R&amp;D. If we reach the developed countries' level of 5% to 7% investment, I think it will be positive. In our case, we have to do what the market needs. Vestel allocates 7% of its budget to R&amp;D.</p><h4>What role can Vestel play in reducing Turkey's current account deficit through exports?</h4><p>We can increase our exports, and if we have the opportunity to support some of the investments that Turkey is attracting it will be good, too. Since our volumes are increasing and the currency price is being re-evaluated, Turkey can be competitive, supporting huge quantities. At the beginning of 2012, the figures will be satisfactory for companies like ours to build supply chain organizations. This turn will have a positive effect on the deficit. Not a huge effect, but better than nothing.</p><h4>What targets do you have for increasing exports in the medium term?</h4><p>We will add new products to our range. Still, our market share is more than before. I think we will have 50% more exports in 2012 than in 2011.</p><h4>What's your current market share in Europe?</h4><p>In electronics, we're number three. I don't think we can be number two, but we are going to firm up our position at number three. In appliances, we want to be in the top five. We are not there for the time being, but I think we will be in 2012, because we are making substantial investments to get there. Right now we are investing in new models, and they will be finished in the first quarter of 2012. This is going to affect our growth. We're number one for TVs and number three for appliances in Turkey.</p><h4>How would you assess Turkey's customs regulations for exporters?</h4><p>There is no problem. It's much better than before, because the regulations are not as complicated as they were. The difficulties experienced in other countries are non-existent here. I think it is definitely better than Belgium and Russia. Every country has difficulties, but this crisis is going to change the rules. Everything is going to be simpler and it will positively affect exports.</p><h4>A number of Turkish firms have been widely successful on the international stage with white goods and electronics. Would you attribute this solely to the supply chain within Turkey?</h4><p>Yes, and we have good qualified people. Once you can produce quality goods at cheaper prices, that is enough to achieve success. As we all know, the importance of Turkish goods in the international market place is growing, and this fact is undeniable. Exports are the main power of our economy, from north to south, and from east to west. Many countries have increased their demand for Turkish products. However, in Europe, there are many rules in place to support consumer rights, and this means every product on the market is quality. Given that that is the case, the smart consumer will then choose the cheaper products. Brands are only important in developing countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led Petroecuador's growth to exceed expectations?</h4><p>We accomplished the plan proposed at the beginning of the 2011, to drill new wells with a large number of towers. Our strategy was successful, and the wells we've added have been very productive. We also launched a successful and productive new oil field, the Drago. The Drago is currently producing 10,000 barrels a day, and we hope to double this figure in the coming years. We were successful in completing our program and in the discovery of reserves. This has allowed us to achieve our targeted level of production and exceed the prediction of 6% growth. We planned to produce 52 million barrels per year, but we obtained 55.3 million. Thanks to our subsidiary Rí­o Napo, we were able to produce an additional 50,000 barrels per day. In 2011 we produced approximately 200,000 barrels per day. We maintain an investment fund, and in 2011 we were able to add $500 million more to our investment capabilities in the areas of exploration and production (E&amp;P). Regarding gas, we assumed the platform that belonged to US-based EDC in 2011. We have also incorporated reserves of 18 million barrels of oil in 2011. On the E&amp;P side, we are finishing negotiations to hire well-known companies such as Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes so as to integrate new technology, optimize the production of oil, and develop enhanced oil recovery techniques for reserves that will allow us to increase the retrievable resources through methods of secondary and tertiary extraction. We have been carrying out this project since 2011. Petroecuador is more than an oil company, because it is present in every link of the value chain. In the refineries, we have achieved 100% of our goals. The most important refinery in Ecuador is called Esmeraldas, and it is under renovation. This refinery is substantially damaged, and under risk of collapse. At the moment, the refinery is operating at 90% of capacity, and the process of renovation will continue until 2013. Regarding our industrial activities, we have installed a new plant to liquefy natural gas on the Ecuadorean shore, so we can incorporate a new product—liquid natural gas (LNG)—mainly used by companies in industrial applications. In terms of projects, we are aiming to revamp damaged infrastructure and we are constructing new poly-pipelines, terminals, and infrastructure for transport and storage. We are involved in a large project in collaboration with Flopec to build a warehouse for LNG storage on Ecuador's territory, and a gas pipeline through Guayaquil, where consumption is larger. This project will cost $300 million and is scheduled to be completed over 2012. We have also enjoyed good fortune in our sales. The international price of oil has exceeded the prices we expected. We estimate to sell crude oil at $73 per barrel, and we did it for an average of $95.</p><h4>What factors will characterize the merger between Petroecuador and Petroamazonas?</h4><p>In partnership with Deloitte, we began submitting information and determining the existing options for restructuring the company in March 2011. Petroamazonas is an oil company that manages a number of fields in the Amazon region; the idea is to unify our efforts, form a synergy, and be more efficient than we are separately. Petroamazonas will manage the transport of oil and gas through pipelines, the international commercialization of oil, and the refining and commercialization of derivatives. EP Petroamazonas will take care of all upstream activities. This means we are completely changing our structure as we incorporate new technology, systems, procedures, business culture, and human resources management. The merger will help to avoid mistakes and unnecessary redundancies. In that sense, we are trying to incorporate new IT systems to connect all of our segments. Petroecuador already has excellent technology regarding the engineering of pipelines, but our departments are operating in an isolated way. We are working toward an integrated system. Furthermore, we aim to improve our training to achieve better results from our employee base.</p><div class="quote">“We accomplished the plan proposed at the beginning of the 2011, to drill new wells with a large number of towers."</div><h4>Petroecuador plans to invest over $2 billion to modernize its refineries. How much capacity will be added?</h4><p>The renovation of the Esmeraldas Refinery will cost $750 million, and we have been working on the project since 2008. Apart from refinery renovation, we began a program to improve the quality of our fuels at the end of 2011. The program consists of developing the production of diesel and gasoline. In diesel, we have reduced the content of sulfur to 500 parts per million, but we aim to reduce it to 250 parts per million by mid-2012. Regarding gasoline, we will increase the octane level to 87 as an initial step. Simultaneously, we are carrying out industrial projects to build new plants for the improvement of fuel quality. These projects are at the Refinery of the Amazon, and the cost will amount to $800 million. In total, we will invest $1.4 billion to improve the quality of our fuels. Moreover, we have a project to build a new Refinery on the Pacific, with a budget of around $1.2 billion. Our goals are two fold: export crude oil and begin exporting high-quality crude oil derivatives while filling the gaps in the country's demand. Currently, we are importers of large volumes of diesel, naphtha, and LNG. Finally, we want to improve the quality of fuels to achieve the highest standards in the world. Our goal is to have fuels that meet Euro-5 standards.</p><h4>How has work evolved on the Pacific refinery project?</h4><p>We are in the final phase of basic engineering. Leading up to this stage, we conducted display studies, conceptual engineering, and environmental studies, purchased land, and developed the necessary infrastructure such as an access road and worksite. Once we finish the basic engineering, we hope to obtain the environmental permits. The investments will total $456 million, covered by two partners: Petroecuador and Petróleos de Venezuela, (PDVSA). Then we will begin looking for financing. We are looking for one or two partners interested in participating in this project, and we have already approached some potential investors, constructors, and licensors that are interested. The licensors have already been defined, and are among the best in the world: Honeywell UOP from US, Praxens from France, Holster from the US, and the Linde Group from Germany.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When and why was the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) established?</h4><p>The KHDA was established in April 2007, with a local decree from the government of Dubai. An education council had been in place for about 18 months prior to this. The government realized that education needed to keep pace with the demands of modern society, and so it commissioned KHDA as a local authority to monitor and improve the delivery of education, particularly in the private sector and the key stages of schooling. We also have a remit to look at the growth of early learning, higher education, and training centers. Our role is basically as a regulator for the sector; we work with other departments to ensure that education keeps up with the pace and demands of development in Dubai.</p><h4>How do you work in collaboration with other entities in the Knowledge Village and Academic City?</h4><p>In 2002, there were very few private universities. The government had the idea of creating an Academic City cluster, where regional branch campuses of international universities could be set up in the free zones of Dubai. Dubai-based students would initially attend these universities, to be followed by students in the region. The plan is that we will be able to provide locally educated talent to meet the needs of the labor market, rather than bringing in people from abroad. Students leave Dubai after high school, whether for social or financial reasons. Between 2003 and 2005, there was not a great impetus to improve higher and further education—but there was a real need to set up these small cities and centers to advance the cause of academia and professional training institutes. Since then, these cities have expanded to house many branch campuses. Our role at KHDA is to assure the quality of these institutions and encourage them to provide courses that meet the diverse demands of Dubai's future labor force.</p><div class="quote">“We have to motivate our schools and hold them publicly accountable by publishing the results."</div><h4>What work are you doing to promote international education in Dubai?</h4><p>The history of private international education here goes as far back as the 1960s. At that time, a group of Indian traders requested to set up a community school for the Indian expatriates who had settled in Dubai. The government provided land, and this was the birth of the first private school in Dubai. After that, the British who had settled in Dubai requested a British school be built. In the 1970s, US citizens expressed an interest in building an American school. Historically, private schools were set up for business reasons, geared toward certain communities. As more people came to Dubai in the 1980s and 1990s, the number of private schools continued to increase. However, the real turning point occurred in the 2000s, with the establishment of free zones. Also around that time, operators were legally entitled to own property. As a result of these government decisions, many expatriates chose to stay in Dubai for a longer time, and the population grew by more than 10% per year. As a result of these initiatives, 87% of all education in Dubai currently takes place in the private sector. Over 50% of Emirati nationals also attend private schools. About 13% of students in private schools—25,000 people—commute to Dubai from other emirates. Driven by national and expatriate demand, Dubai currently boasts the greatest number of branch university campuses in the world. As a regulator, we want to strike a balance between encouraging sustainable growth while ensuring quality. Dubai has excellent infrastructure and housing. As the market has stabilized, this has attracted—and will continue to attract—more people.</p><h4>How do you foresee the growth of the education sector in Dubai?</h4><p>The schools in Dubai are very diverse. There are 13 different international curricula operating, with most students attending Indian, UK, and US curriculum schools. We have to bear in mind the business models of each school. There are community schools, embassy schools, and philanthropic schools, as well as non-profit and for-profit schools. We also have to understand the different sizes of schools. We have schools for 50, 500, 5,000, and 10,000 students. The fees are also very diverse. From 2001-2008, there was an average of 7% growth in school enrolments each year. Between 2008 and 2011, we registered 4% annual growth, mainly in the private sector. We are also seeing a consistent increase in the number of students enrolled in higher education. Fundamentally, our education system differs from many places in the world in that it is not mainly provided by the government. In the face of the global financial crisis, many countries have greatly reduced their education spending. However, because our schools are privately run, the school system was not hit too hard. More people came than left during the economic crisis, maintaining a natural growth. In the region, the demand for private education will rise. As GDP grows, more people will want to enroll their children in private schools.</p><h4>How are you regulating the cost of private school fees in Dubai?</h4><p>Five years ago, we realized that schools' diverse business models and the growth of the population caused higher demand than supply, which is not an ideal situation. The older regulations were very conservative, and during the boom education options were restricted. Expatriate students could not choose to go to public schools, yet there were limited places available in private schools. There was little information available to help parents choose schools; they only had location, curriculum, and fees to base their decisions on. There was no data about the actual quality of education. At that time, we adopted a controlled-fee frame as an interim or medium-term strategy. We will maintain this approach until enough supply is in place to balance the market. At the same time, we have encouraged new schools to open. We also installed the first quality control mechanism for schools in the region, called the Dubai Schools Inspection Bureau (DSIB). It has led to a tremendous improvement in our schools. Many parents are basing their enrolment decisions on the information supplied by the Bureau. The biggest change has been within the schools themselves, which use the Bureau's recommendations as an operation manual. From the 2012/13 academic year, KHDA will be implementing a new school fees framework. This is a long-term framework that was developed in cooperation with the Department of Economic Development, the Department of Finance, the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, the Dubai Real Estate Corporation, the Dubai Statistics Centre, the Dubai Executive Council and KHDA. It is based on the quality of education each school offers along with the Educational Cost Index (ECI), which is a measure of the annual costs of running a school calculated by the Dubai Statistics Centre. The framework is designed to encourage schools to improve further to satisfy parents and students and to allow schools to develop long-term growth plans.</p><h4>What do you expect the DSIB to reveal in 2012?</h4><p>This is the Bureau's fourth year. Every year, we publish two reports. The first is for schools using the Indian curriculum, which is released in April. A report on the remaining private schools will be released in May/June this year. After our inspections, every school receives a 20-page document of our findings and recommendations. For the majority of the time, schools use the information to compare themselves to each other. Two Indian schools are rated outstanding this year for the first time, and one of those schools has 7,000 students. Another school with 3,000 students received that rank, which means 10,000 students enrolled in Indian-style schools are rated outstanding, the highest honor. Over the last four years, we have witnessed a marked increase in the number of schools with a “good" and “outstanding" rating. In 2011, we completed the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) review, which will be published in December. This assessment will demonstrate how far we have come since KHDA was established. It's an international tool for comparison that will measure our system against the global education industry. From the year-on-year increase in quality that we have measured internally, we expect very positive results. The World Bank has said that every country is trying to reform its education strategy. The difference is that education in Dubai is driven by the private sector. Over the last four years, we have not focused on the same aspects of education as the public sector has. We don't directly control recruitment, curriculum development, construction, or deliver leadership and teacher training. KHDA doesn't manage or operate these aspects, but we do have control over the regulations. We have to motivate our schools and hold them publicly accountable by publishing the results. Many other countries do not take this road, but it's the only option we have. The road we've chosen is the one less travelled. The bottom line is that the numbers will speak volumes about our model.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dreaming-ipo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2011 you drove a merger of the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and NASDAQ Dubai. What was the strategic driving force behind this move?</h4><p>Since the inception of DFM in 2000, we have remained committed to playing a vital role in developing regional financial markets through various initiatives. The aim of this transaction was to enhance efficiency and maximize value for all stakeholders by widening DFM's asset classes, allowing the company's shareholders to benefit from the future growth of NASDAQ Dubai, and further developing closer operational links between the two exchanges. The current ownership structure creates a dynamic new force in the region's capital markets and will further strengthen Dubai's leading role as a center of capital markets and innovation that places the interests of investors, issuers, and brokers first. Undoubtedly, the combined strengths of the two exchanges will help to attract new issuers from across the region and internationally, who can now choose which of the two exchanges is more appropriate for them according to their commercial and regulatory preferences. And as part of the consolidation, DFM welcomed on July 11, 2010, the commencement of the outsourcing of the trading, clearing, settlement, and custody of NASDAQ Dubai securities to DFM's trading platform. The trading of NASDAQ Dubai securities through DFM's platform not only provides investors with a wider array of product offerings, it also enables DFM's solid base of over 567,000 investors to trade in these securities, both of which will further enhance liquidity and activity on NASDAQ Dubai. The outsourcing of NASDAQ Dubai's trading, custody, settlement, and clearing functions for equities to DFM's systems in July 2010 was a landmark in exchange consolidation in the GCC. It has improved access for DFM's individual investors to NASDAQ Dubai by enabling them to trade on both exchanges with one investor number and through the same platform. As a result, DFM's individual investors now trade in one liquidity pool, from which NASDAQ Dubai's institutional investors and individuals' share of NASDAQ Dubai trading has risen significantly.</p><h4>After some turbulent trading, are you hopeful that there will be some more interest from companies in floating their shares?</h4><p>Naturally, the primary market is highly correlated to the secondary market, and as we all know the stock markets have been going through unfavorable conditions due to the repercussions of the global economic crisis. Consequently, IPOs went into a period of slowdown over the last three years. However, we have been engaged in continuous discussion with potential issuers, and we can see an enormous backlog that will flow into the market once conditions are more favorable and the business owners realize the possibility to have attractive valuations. According to an independent survey commissioned by DFM, the majority of respondents from private and family businesses were interested in going public over the next two to three years as they acknowledge the importance of tapping into capital markets to fund their expansion plans and sustain growth. Undoubtedly, taking a private company into the public arena is an essential step in the preparation to meet challenges by embracing international best practices in the company's management, corporate governance, and investor relations. The overall aim of our efforts is to see a better representation of the UAE national economy by attracting companies representing the most dynamic and growing sectors, such as retail, tourism, health care, education, and family conglomerates into our market and diversifying investment opportunities for investors.</p><div class="quote">“We have remained committed to playing a vital role in developing regional financial markets through various initiatives."</div><h4>What initiatives are you undertaking to attract further listings?</h4><p>Throughout its momentous history, DFM has demonstrated a firm commitment to take the necessary initiatives to strengthen the financial markets sector and has played a vital role in the development of Dubai by offering listed companies a much needed platform to grow. DFM has always maintained close relations with advisory and regulatory partners to highlight the benefits and positive implications of going public and listing. As part of these efforts we have launched the Guide to Going Public, which is a comprehensive guide for privately held and family businesses to see in detail the steps needed to take a company into the public arena. Additionally, we have commissioned an independent international advisor to study the IPO sector and recently we organized an exclusive interactive forum, titled Going Public—Achieving Sustainable Growth, attracting 40 top executives from 30 leading companies. The forum constituted a momentous opportunity for unlisted family and privately owned companies to get a better understanding of the IPO decision framework and identify the key success factors for effective preparation to go public. In the past we have seen many companies reaping the benefits of going public and we are confident that this will increase in the near future. We believe now is the right time for companies to prepare themselves to go public, as we expect the IPO backlog of the past three years will come to fruition once the market sentiment improves.</p><h4>What new instruments and platforms are being developed to drive the evolution of Dubai's stock exchange?</h4><p>DFM spares no effort and takes numerous initiatives to lay out the necessary framework for various market enhancements. As part of these efforts we have shifted to a delivery versus payment (DVP) model to embrace international best practices and we have successfully consolidated with NASDAQ Dubai, creating a larger and unified liquidity pool and diversified asset classes through the trading of NASDAQ Dubai securities on the DFM platform. Recently, this drive was reinforced through the trading of Dubai Gold Securities via our platform as well. As for developments in the near future, we are now in the process of introducing new market enhancements including short selling, securities borrowing and lending, and market making. We are confident that these widely recognized developments over the last two years have set the market on the right track for sustainable growth.</p><h4>What industries do you believe have the most growth potential in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai is gifted with one of the most highly diversified economies in this part of the world with fast growing sectors, including trade, tourism, health care, and education. As our exchange is heavily dominated by real estate and financial listings and the growing sectors of Dubai are misrepresented, we are trying to tackle this issue. As Dubai has managed to build a second-to-none, world-class infrastructure, we believe that the trade and services sectors will continue to drive a strong performance.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai International is the fourth largest airport in the world. What have been the key factors that have let to Dubai's tremendous success and growth as an aviation hub?</h4><p>Dubai's geo-centric location, high-caliber infrastructure, quality home airlines, and an aviation model that features a liberal regulatory and tax-free business environment and close coordination and collaboration within the sector are the key factors in our growth story. Thanks to Dubai's open skies policy, the airport is connected to more than 220 destinations across six continents through 150 airlines, and continues to attract more airlines. It is a model that is paying big dividends. According to Oxford Economics, direct and indirect aviation, in total, supports over 250,000 jobs and contributes over $22 billion to the economy, which represents around 19% of total employment in Dubai, and 28% of Dubai's $80 billion. On the basis of these strengths and the forecasts for passenger growth from Boeing and Airbus, Oxford Economics expects the economic contribution of Dubai's aviation sector to rise to 32% of Dubai's GDP and about 22% of its employment by 2020.</p><h4>The aviation industry as a whole has been through some tough years. In what ways do you believe airports and airlines should be pulling together to support greater commercial growth in the industry?</h4><p>Greater collaboration is needed across the entire aviation value chain. Although there have been some improvements over the years, globally there remains fundamental mistrust between the various members of the sector, namely airlines, airports, control authorities, and retailers. Each closely guards customer data. And each creates processes and applies technology without considering the entire travel experience for our mutual customers. All these activities take place in separate, vertical silos, whilst our mutual customers bump roughly across the joins between them. And those joins involve something we all hate; queues. The time wasted not only frustrates our passengers, it drives up costs, reduces dwell time, and limits revenue generated in airport shops and food and beverage outlets. And let's not forget the role of government. Policy makers in most of the mature aviation markets worldwide fail to recognize the vital economic role and contributions of aviation and logistics, especially in the face of worldwide financial turmoil. A healthy aviation sector facilitates trade, commerce, and tourism. Governments need to wake up to the fact that unnecessary taxation regimes and protectionist policies place a drag on growth and in turn stifle economic expansion. Dubai's aviation model is a shining example of the success of an approach that flies in the face of this legacy, thinking both in terms of aviation policy and collaboration across the value chain.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai International continues to be a major attraction for other international airlines."</div><h4>How do you aim to achieve the goal of attracting 90 million passengers through the airport?</h4><p>The combination of a successful tourism industry, Dubai's proximity to the emerging economies of the East, and the Emirate's established role as a trading hub linking economies in the Far East, Europe, Africa, and North America, will drive growth and further consolidate Dubai's status as a global center for trade, tourism, and commerce. The success of Dubai's flagship carrier Emirates, which is among the world's fastest growing airlines, and the meteoric rise of our low-cost carrier flydubai—the two biggest contributors to passenger and cargo traffic at Dubai International—will also remain a major factor in our future growth story. Dubai International continues to be a major attraction for other international airlines, and is already home to 150 of them.</p><h4>How are the plans for Dubai World Central (DWC) progressing, and how will operations there change the market in Dubai as a whole?</h4><p>We opened our second airport, DWC, in June 2010 for cargo operations followed by general aviation in 2011. Since its opening the number of cargo airlines has grown to 36. Cargo volumes during the first calendar year of operations totaled 90,000 tons, and monthly traffic continues to grow at a rapid pace. The first phase of the project also includes a passenger terminal that will be undergoing operational readiness testing in the coming months. Passenger operations are not yet planned and will depend entirely on the commercial needs of our client airlines. Providing capacity where it is needed is our immediate priority, and that happens to be at Dubai International. So over the next 10 years we will be investing $7.8 billion in the expansion of Dubai International to boost capacity from the current 60 million passengers per year to 90 million to accommodate anticipated traffic growth. The additional aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue generated by this increased traffic will fuel the funding of the next phases of DWC, which will ultimately become the world's largest airport with an annual capacity of 160 million passengers and 12 million tons of cargo. In the interim, DWC will play an important role in accommodating cargo, general aviation, and passenger airlines that will find the airport an increasingly attractive option due to emerging slot constraints at Dubai International. DWC is a long-term project and work on it will continue through this decade.</p><h4>When is the specialist A380 terminal opening up and what will this add to the airport?</h4><p>Concourse 3, which is part of the Terminal 3 complex, is a state of the art facility dedicated for use by Emirates for their A380 fleet. The completion of the project later this year will be followed by a series of operational readiness trials that will test every system and process as well as their backups across the facility. Just as we did with the opening of Terminal 3, acknowledged by the industry as a grand success, Concourse 3 will be opened to our customers only after it is 100% ready. We expect the opening to be sometime in the first quarter of 2013. The new facility will increase the capacity of Dubai International from 60 million passengers per annum to 75 million, and with the wide array of service offerings—including retail, duty free, lounges, hotels, and food and beverage—contribute in a major way to the overall customer experience at Dubai International.</p><h4>How have regional unrest and economic woes in Europe affected the demographics of people coming through the airport?</h4><p>Middle East and North Africa were the only two regions to show a contraction in passenger numbers during 2011. The strongest markets served in terms of total passenger numbers included India, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, Germany, and the US. The most significant percentage traffic growth during 2011 was seen on routes linking Dubai to Eastern Europe (81%), Russia and the CIS (30.5%), GGC (26.5%), and North America (16.1%).</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some highlights from your experience in 2011?</h4><p>The most striking events in the life of the company have been launching and developing new products. Throughout 2011, the products we launched began to appear on the shelves and occupy a definitive position in the market, and also met with critical acclaim. It is clear that these products are still at an early stage of development, but we believe in the potential of our “Torpeda" energy drink, and “FUNKY" lemonade drink. “Maxi Tea" has also become a customer favorite, and it is appreciated by both children and adults. The company is constantly working to improve taste and develop production technologies. In 2011, we also launched a pilot development to take the first few steps to export products to Russia. In 2012, we expect to reach a good level of exports to that country. In 2011 our exports to Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan increased enormously, and our products have been very well received in such fraternal countries. Thus, it should be noted that the export of Kazakhstani products is growing and it's great that the country is starting to receive money for products produced on our land. In general, we will remember 2011 as the year sales exploded, growing by more than 40%. We have undergone a large restructuring of our distribution system, accompanied by a significant strengthening of our regional presence. In terms of market conditions, the economy seems to have overcome the effects of the global economic crisis, and normalization has returned to the financial sector. Most banks are now in a much better position to work with manufacturing companies. This allows us to plan the development of the company more confidently and to deal with much more ambitious tasks than ever before.</p><h4>How has the Customs Union affected your operations?</h4><p>On the one hand, the Customs Union complicated the situation, as Russian producers forced their expansion into the Kazakhstani market and thus they put our producers in a rather difficult situation. However, on the other hand the Customs Union simplified the process of launching Kazakhstani products into the Russian market and made Kazakhstani products more attractive. Of course, there is a definite need for support at the governmental level, because the abilities of Russian companies are greater than our own. And it is not because Russian companies are more advanced, and we are less, but simply the Russian market is bigger and, as a result, the capitalization and financial capacity of Russian companies is higher than Kazakhstani companies. It is easier for Russian companies to invest into Kazakhstan to conquer significant market share. The Customs Union, of course, has had a major impact on the food industry. However, it is difficult to determine if this influence is positive or negative. As for our company, the customs duties on raw materials imported from outside the Customs Union have increased. However, import prices have fallen within the Customs Union. So, it was the introduction of the Customs Union that has had an extremely positive impact on Kazakhstan's heavily regulated sugar market, which led to a significant reduction in prices of around 25%. In addition, we are observing that Kazakhstani producers have become more active, trying to conquer a large share of the Russian market. At the same time, the presence of the Russian companies in the Kazakhstani market is growing. It consists mostly of small regional players. In general, we should recognize that the Customs Union has had more of a positive impact than a negative impact.</p><div class="quote">“The most striking events in the life of the company have been launching and developing new products."</div><h4>In 2011 “Torpeda" became the number four brand in the energy drinks segment after only a year of its release. How do you explain its rapid market penetration?</h4><p>We are a team of like-minded people, understanding the market with an absence of fear to take courageous steps. “Torpeda" was introduced to the market at the right time, when consumers were demanding an affordable, alternative energy drink. We simply offered it. It is a cold, thirst-quenching drink that is affordable.</p><h4>Galanz has a 40% market share. Where do you see the toughest competition?</h4><p>Competition in the beverages market, as in all the FMCG segments, is colossal, whether it is in the juice or carbonated drinks segment. Every manufacturer is trying to maximize its presence, investing huge amounts in advertising and promotion. However, everyone fights in a fairly limited market. Markets in other countries are radically different in terms of product grouping, and so Kazakhstani manufacturers are looking for new segments and market niches that haven't been established yet. Laimon Fresh is a good example. It is a soft drink composed entirely of natural ingredients with a unique taste. It has exploded onto the market in Russia, and is also rapidly gaining customers in Kazakhstan as well.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012?</h4><p>In 2012 we set ourselves serious targets including increasing our share in the iced tea category and for the development of our newer brands “Funky" and “Torpeda." We also plan to develop a more efficient table water segment with our “Sevens Water" brand, and to launch new products. We have specific plans for the development of our export zones in 2012, namely Russia, and plans to strengthen our positions in Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. I am confident that 2012 will bring our company even greater success and prosperity. We look ahead with great optimism. We are confident that the year will bring us better results than 2011, mainly due to exports to Russia. New products will also appear on our product line, some of them unique to the Kazakhstani market. We will increase our production capacity and, hopefully, finally get rid of the scarcity of products in our warehouses in the hot summer.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[inviting-investment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To start with, can you tell me about the genesis of Turkapital?</h4><p>Kuwait Finance House (KFH) came to Turkey in 1989. During the 1980s and early 1990s there were hardly any foreign investors coming to Turkey. Kuwait Finance House (KFH) is therefore considered as one of the first comers to Turkey. KFH invested in Turkey by establishing Kuwait Turkish Participation Bank (KTPB) as a wholesale bank, and then shifted more to retail. Since then, KTPB has faced several financial crises, including the 2001 financial crisis in Turkey, which resulted in the birth of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). As a result of the new banking regulations, banks were more and more restricted in terms of their investments. That was the ground for us to start thinking more strategically. We decided to establish an investment arm, while letting the bank continue with its commercial banking activities and to expand even further in retail. This is where the idea of Turkapital (TK) came from. TK was established in late 2007, and registered in the Kingdom of Bahrain with a capital of $150 million. The main focus for operations and investments is Turkey and the Turkic republics including Eastern Europe, while the management is in Kuwait.</p><h4>In terms of Azerbaijan, how would you gauge appetite for private equity?</h4><p>In general, private equity (PE) is now entering into a new era globally while it is relatively new in this part of the world, and therefore it becomes a challenge. The laws and regulatory landscape in Azerbaijan do not necessarily match investors' requirements and standards yet. International investors come with a set of basic and general expectations, for example; to see international financial accounting standards applied, or issues pertaining to the tax regime, which may not be available in this part of the world. As a result, this could potentially double the amount of work to be done by investors when it comes to PE, especially in areas like valuations and entering into any investment idea. To put it simply, although it is a tough market environment, it is true for most emerging markets. In Azerbaijan, we have looked at some private equity opportunities in the past but we haven't realized any yet.</p><h4>Do you foresee the environment changing?</h4><p>Yes, it has to and it has been when looking back 3-4 years ago when conditions and the environment for PE were discouraging. I think that given Azerbaijan's potential in terms of geographic location and economic growth prospects, there are many attractive opportunities for global investors. It's also a two-way street; while some of the more aggressive investors would accept some of the local standards and regulations, Azerbaijan is also changing to meet some of the international investor standards and expectations.</p><h4>It makes me curious to hear you mention aggressive investors. How would you describe Turkapital's style of investment?</h4><p>TK is a relatively small, conservative investment house. I wouldn't characterize Turkapital as an aggressive investor. PE investors continue to seek opportunities at an increased rate and this is to efficiently utilize capital. TK is able to do this in Turkey as Turkey is a different story for us, because we've been in the country for 22 years as a group, and have what it takes in terms of the local know-how and network, therefore it is easier to enter into and to conclude PE projects. However, in Azerbaijan we are relatively new and it will take some time for us to realize a private equity deal.</p><h4>Where do you specifically see potential in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>There's a lot, especially in public sector and infrastructure projects. This can be in transportation, in health care, and even in education. On the other hand, the private sector offers a lot of opportunities as well. The region as whole is characterized as an emerging market region, and this provides a lot of good opportunities for us to consider. As a sector, real estate also offers a lot of opportunities like development and regeneration projects or fixed income. I remember after establishing our office in Azerbaijan three years ago, we came to rent office space and we were limited to about four or five sites in Baku. Back then, this gave me an idea about what the market offers in terms of vacancies for office space and the potential as well. I also had a chance to go outside Baku and saw the need for much infrastructure development.</p><h4>What are the chances of Azerbaijan developing a competitive Islamic finance sector?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a member country of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and I believe IDB may lead to promote or introduce Islamic banking laws in Azerbaijan in order to attract investors. Turkey's banking law, which includes participation bank laws, can be a good example for Azerbaijan to take into consideration. Participation banks have been operating for 25 years in Turkey and are successful. I believe Azerbaijan can benefit from Turkey's experience in developing legislation for participation banks.</p><h4>How would you rate participation banking in Turkey compared to other countries?</h4><p>Outstanding, from both regulatory and performance perspectives. There are four participation banks in Turkey. Given the great potential for growth, evidenced by the track record performance over the last 10 years, I am optimistic for further growth. Turkey's participation banks were brought under the umbrella of the BRSA and the banking law. I brought a copy of Turkish banking law to the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR) a few years back for them to get an idea of the Turkish regulatory model. As a group, KFH has experience in helping draft such laws. We did this in Kuwait, in Bahrain, and in Turkey. That's why we gave a copy of the banking law to CBAR for them to take it into consideration.</p><h4>When the financial crisis struck the world, there was a lot of talk about how well sharia-compliant banking performed. How do you think the industry has fared during the crisis?</h4><p>Given a sharia-compliant bank is asset-based in its modes-operandi, one would assume that a sharia-compliant bank would outperform a non-sharia compliant one, especially in a financial crisis similar to that which struck the world recently. However, given the magnitude of the crisis, there were many asset-based financial institutions hit and negatively impacted. I am more comfortable now with the term “ethical banking" instead of sharia-compliant, especially after the crisis. Greed, which many attribute as one of the   main causes that lead to the crisis, is assumed to be absent in a true ethical banking institution.</p><h4>Coming back to private equity, can you tell us about some of your flagship investments?</h4><p>We closed the year 2010 with losses, but this is natural for a holding in its first years of operation. During those years we've entered into the automotive sector by acquiring Autoland in mid-2008. It's an auto fleet leasing company for corporate clients. The model under which we operate has been tested and is almost risk free. When we bought the company, it had 100-150 cars. We closed the year 2010 with a fleet size slightly above 2,000 cars. Our aim is to continue growing the fleet size. We've also increased Autoland's capital to about $20 million. Another investment completed was a greenfield; an alternative insurance company, established in Turkey under the name Neova. The sector is regulated in Turkey under the Turkish Treasury. It took us more than a year to finalize all establishment procedures, to comply with all requirements, and for Neova to finally start operations in December 2009. We closed the year 2010 with good results in terms of performance and volume. We use KTPB, which has over 150 branches nationwide, as one of our insurance sales points, and we have contracted with other banks as well, bringing our number of distribution channels to about 500. This is the strength of Neova insurance. We have had 15 months of performance and we have issued over 300,000 policies. A third investment realized is in real estate, through another subsidiary of Turkapital called Iskan Real Estate with a capital of about $50 million. Iskan started with about 120 residential units for sale and to date has sold around 50. Another investment was realized in 2010, when we invested in acquiring warehouses in Istanbul. It was an industrial real estate investment of $20 million. Also, in Azerbaijan, in 2011, we closed our first deal and this was the acquisition of a part of a shopping mall. The deal size was $5.5 million and we own part of a shopping mall, which has tenants. Finally, in the Republic of Tatarstan we have established an investment company with the government of the republic and we are looking to close some deals before the end of 2011.</p><h4>Macro-economically, what do you think are Azerbaijan's strengths and challenges?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is an emerging market with high potential for growth. In 2008 it had the highest growth rate in the world; I think it was around 26 or 28%. This may have been driven by rising oil prices. However, Azerbaijan as an emerging market has to re-position to have a diverse economy that is less dependent on oil as a main source of income and to attract foreign investment. Azerbaijan needs to take more concrete steps to diversify the economy. Upgrading regulations to match international standards and norms, transparency, and bureaucracy are all part of the challenge and are very important when it comes to attracting foreign investment. I think there is great potential in Azerbaijan and I think that the region as whole must re-position itself to provide improved legislation and a solid investment environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[paving-the-way]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes İsfalt unique as a state-run company?</h4><p>Our company is owned by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Our sole aim isn't profit. Sure, we want to be profitable, but the most important thing is to spend our money effectively, and increase the service we supply to the municipality. In short, instead of paving 1 million tons of asphalt per year, our aim is to pave 1.2 million tons of asphalt with the same budget.</p><h4>How would you compare your level of activity in 2011 to previous years?</h4><p>It depends on the budget allocated by the municipality, but this year we expect production to increase by 20%. We don't just sell to the metropolitan municipality but to other municipalities as well. As the Turkish economy grows, asphalt demand also grows. If we compare Turkey to European countries, Germany produces 50 million tons of asphalt per year, Italy and the UK around 40 million tons, whereas Turkey produces 20 million tons, and that's increasing day by day. The quality of our asphalt is also getting better day by day.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges of paving in Istanbul?</h4><p>Istanbul has bigger needs and special circumstances compared to other cities in Turkey. It really is in a class of its own. There's a lot of traffic congestion here and very heavy demands on infrastructure. For example, we can't work during the day; it has to be late at night or very early in the morning. The city continues to grow very rapidly. A third bridge will be built across the Bosphorus, new roads are needed, old roads need to be repaved, and so on. When you consider the number of vehicles in a city like this, not to mention the rate at which it's growing, you realize maintenance work has to be frequent and fast. You have to keep up with these needs, adapt to these circumstances, and also be innovative and creative in your products, services, management, and execution. Right now I would say we are number one in terms of quality, services, and also laboratory activities. We keep track of new innovations around the world and incorporate them immediately into our activities. We are members of the American Asphalt Institute and the European Pavement Association, and are in touch with everything that's happening in the field.</p><h4>What have been your biggest projects in recent years?</h4><p>The borders of Istanbul's metropolitan municipality were enlarged in 2005, and we grew in line with that, doubling both our production and turnover since 2005. We've paved 5,000 kilometers of roads in Istanbul. We're responsible for everything from surrounding villages to Istiklal Avenue.</p><h4>What are the most significant projects on the horizon?</h4><p>The biggest one right now is the paving of Istiklal Avenue with a new elastic kind of asphalt, which is both very flexible and also aesthetic. The tramline that runs down Istiklal will also benefit greatly as the elasticity will reduce stress caused both on the tram and the street. This type of asphalt is called mosaic asphalt, but we hope to rename it “Istiklal" asphalt. Another kind of asphalt we use is warm asphalt, which is more environmentally friendly as it gives off far less emissions in the  production stage.</p><h4>What's your vision for the future of İsfalt?</h4><p>We expect to be privatized within about the next 10 years. Istanbul Sea Buses (İDO), for example, was privatized in 2011. We too are scheduled for privatization in five years. This would be a good move. We should be able to work not just in Istanbul but also on other projects throughout Turkey, like with the Turkish highway authority, and also on projects outside of Turkey. As we expand to those areas our company will grow concomitantly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Right Conditions]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-right-conditions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant is Turkey within BP's global portfolio?</h4><p>Very significant, actually. Turkey is very important for BP. We have been operating here for nearly 100 years. Our downstream businesses here date from the 1940s. For our fuels business, Turkey is one of five strategic markets worldwide. For lubricants, Turkey is one of the top 10 markets. On the upstream side, Turkey has two of our globally strategic investments. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline exports 1 million bbl/d of Azeri crude to world markets, and we sell 6.6 billion cubic meters of Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas to Turkey annually. BP is the largest shareholder and operator of the BTC pipeline. As you can see from all these investments and businesses, Turkey is indeed quite significant to BP.</p><h4>What steps should be taken, from both the public and private sectors, to reduce Turkey's dependence on foreign imports to meet its energy needs?</h4><p>This has been a goal of Turkey's governments for many years. Reducing the dependence on foreign imports is attainable primarily in two ways: focus on energy efficiency, and increase indigenous production. The first is the role of not just the government, but the private sector and society as a whole. The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has several initiatives aimed at this objective. The second has to do with increasing the amount of exploration for oil and gas in Turkey. This also has to do with national strategy and policies. The government needs to ensure that the right conditions are set for investment by private sector exploration and production companies.</p><h4>On the downstream side, what are your plans regarding branch expansion and what does this signal about your expectations for the Turkish fuel oil market?</h4><p>We expect the Turkish fuels market to grow in line with economic growth. As BP, we are continuing to invest. We will be opening 20-30 new retail stations in 2011, and will be increasing the number of cities where we are present. Currently we are in fourth position in overall national market share, but we are not in all cities in Turkey. We are number two or number three in the markets where we choose to participate.</p><p>Unfortunately, Turkey's fuels market growth is currently not in line with GDP growth. One major cause of this is the illegal usage of certain base oils as motor fuels. We see this as one of the major problems of the fuel industry in Turkey. Not only is this issue holding back the industry, but it is causing a major loss of tax revenue for the government. As a responsible and compliant company, and a major worldwide industry leader, we hope that this issue is resolved quickly.</p><h4>Following changes to legislation in 2009 limiting the contract terms of gas retail franchises to five years, how have compliance efforts affected BP and the sector?</h4><p>I think it is fair to say that the sector had a very tough time in 2010 due to the implementation of this legislation. It is one thing to limit dealer contracts to five years, but an altogether different thing to make this legislation retroactive to past years. The majority of dealer contracts had to be re-negotiated, causing around TL1 billion in expenditures to the fuel distribution companies.</p><p>While we understand the reasoning behind the five-year limit, we feel that applying the law retroactively was not in line with free market regulations. As BP, we were one of the companies that did relatively well, with a minimal loss of stations. What we have lost in a certain number of stations we have made up in overall volume. However, we ended up investing around $150 million in 2010, which is several times our normal investment plan in a normal year and was an investment that has not benefitted the consumer.</p><h4>Regarding BP's lubricant oil sales, how can we assess the investments made, and what can we expect from BP in this area for the coming years?</h4><p>BP and Castrol Lubricants are continuously developing their products toward innovation and more performance. We play an important role with automobile producers, where we help them develop their engines and lubricants. Engine manufacturers need to get more horsepower from smaller engines in order to meet EU norms. BP engineers are working together with leading engine manufacturers such as Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Honda, and Audi.</p><p>In Turkey, BP's lubricants blending plant in Gemlik is able to produce these high-tech, innovative lubricants for the Turkish market and beyond. In 2011, we will continue to invest in our brand, business partners, marketing and sponsorship activities, with the aim of providing increased advantages to our customers.</p><h4>How has the development of the construction and manufacturing sectors in Turkey benefitted your sales in lubricant oils and other oil products?</h4><p>Under the BP Lubricants roof, we have two main industry-leading brands: BP and Castrol. We develop our products under both brands with the partnership and cooperation of leading vehicle manufacturers. Our Castrol and BP brands in Turkey are the market leaders in both automotive and heavy-duty lubricants. We also provide robust solutions for other areas as well, such as marine and specialized industrial needs. Our heavy-duty vehicle lubricants make up a large part of our Turkey business by volume, and we work closely with large heavy-duty manufacturers such as Scania, DAF, Mercedes-Benz, Isuzu,  and Temsa.</p><h4>In which segments do you anticipate the most growth in 2011-2012?</h4><p>If Turkey's economy continues to grow, we would expect that the fuels and lubricants segments will also grow in parallel. However, the growth in fuels currently is not in line with GDP growth. A major cause of this is the illegal usage of certain base oils as motor fuels. In other words, motorists are using base oil illegally to fuel their cars and trucks, because base oil is cheaper. This is not only an issue that is having a large impact on the industry, but it is also causing a major loss of tax revenue for the government—not to mention the environmental impact of burning a base lubricant instead of a motor fuel. As a responsible and compliant company, and a major worldwide industry leader, our wish is that this issue is resolved urgently.</p><h4>How does Turkey figure on BP's radar for future large-scale investments, and what form are investments likely to take?</h4><p>Our largest investment in Turkey is the BTC pipeline, which exports 1 million bbl/d of Azeri crude to world markets. We also transport 6.6 billion cubic meters of Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas to Turkey annually. Our next large project on the horizon is the sale and transit of Shah Deniz Phase 2 gas, in the 2017 timeframe. An additional 6 billion cubic meters of gas will be sold to Turkey through this project, and up to 10 billion cubic meters annually will transit through Turkey to be sold to European customers. The Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan is one of the largest gas fields in the world, and is in fact the largest in BP's global portfolio.</p><h4>How has the BTC impacted Turkey's energy and economic landscape?</h4><p>We believe that the BTC has had a very positive impact on Turkey for three main reasons. First, it is the first multi-country, multi-company energy project and is an important first step toward attaining Turkey's role as an “energy corridor". Second, it is a very good model of international cooperation within the region. Third, a total of $23 million has been invested in community programs along the Turkish section of the pipeline. Through these programs, the BTC has supported everything from local infrastructure, local employment, agriculture, capacity building, education, and many other areas. These are truly world-class corporate responsibility programs that are used as case studies in many parts of the world.</p><h4>In your view, what is Turkey's role in ensuring global energy security?</h4><p>Turkey's aspirations are to become an “energy corridor" or “energy hub". Located between the producer countries in the East and the consuming countries in the West, Turkey has a strategic geographical position. I believe that Turkey is very important for both European and global energy security.</p><p>Currently, close to 4% of the world's daily oil supply transits Turkey. This includes the Turkish Straits, and pipelines such as the BTC. This is a large number when you consider the close difference between supply and demand. On gas, there is the “Southern Corridor", which is an important new route of gas for Europe. For example, Shah Deniz Phase 2 gas from Azerbaijan will likely transit Turkey on its way to European markets. We expect this to happen in the 2017 timeframe. There are many other gas sources in the region that could eventually be transported through Turkey as well, such as from Iraq.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Foreign investors around the world are apprehensive about the possibility of a new financial crisis in the international market. How do you respond to this sensitivity, and in what ways does the Turkish market hedge against such risk?</h4><p>The Turkish financial markets have been very resilient to the recent global financial crisis. Not even a single bank was bailed out by the government during the crisis. On the contrary, the Turkish financial sector has witnessed real growth in 2009, when many economies contracted and hundreds of banks were bailed out in major economies. For example, the banking sector in Turkey increased its profit by 50% in 2009 when the crisis hit all economies across the world hard. Moreover, Turkey has been the only OECD country that did not have to introduce financial relief packages in order to mitigate the negative impact of the crisis. That being said, we are well aware of a possible new financial crisis, but as Turkey has a very strong regulatory and supervisory financial structure, both the government and independent authorities, such as the Central Bank and the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), are closely following the developments in the global financial markets as well as in the domestic market and accordingly taking measures against future risks. So far their policies and measures have proved prudent and right.</p><h4>How has the new Turkish Commercial Code changed the foreign investment landscape?</h4><p>The new Turkish Commercial Code has overhauled the whole business legislation together with the new Obligation Code. First of all, the new Commercial Code brings Turkey's business legislation in line with international standards, in particular with EU standards and legislation. For example, the new law aims to incorporate internationally accepted accounting standards into domestic legislation, increase the transparency of enterprises, and prevent unfair competition. Introducing the use of ICT in the business world, the new law makes it easier for investors to run their business in Turkey even from their home countries. Similarly, the new code makes it easier for investors to establish a new company in Turkey.</p><h4>A number of leading multinationals have chosen Istanbul as a regional headquarters. What are Turkey's comparative strengths as a regional base of operations?</h4><p>Turkey's growing domestic market together with the potential markets in the neighboring region make Turkey an ideal place for investment, because from Turkey you can easily access markets in the Middle East, North Africa, Caucasus, and Central Asian republics. That is why many global companies are taking advantage of this strategic location by relocating their regional headquarters to Turkey. For example, Coca-Cola is managing 94 countries from its headquarters in Istanbul; similarly Microsoft is managing 80 countries. In addition to the strategic location, the skilled labor force as well as the availability of component senior managers in Turkey attract multinational companies to move their regional headquarters to Turkey. Besides being a hub for managerial operations of global companies, Turkey is also developing into a manufacturing base for global investors. With its competitive business environment and skilled labor force Turkey offers many advantages for global manufacturing companies. Global manufacturing companies are well aware of the unique advantages of Turkey. For example, Foxconn, the global IT giant that manufactures computers for HP, has recently inaugurated a manufacturing facility in Turkey. Foxconn is going to produce more than 2 million computers for HP in Turkey to export to the markets in the Middle East, North Africa, and other markets in the region.</p><h4>What current or projected incentive schemes would you like to highlight?</h4><p>Turkey offers quite generous incentives for investors. What is most striking with the current investment schemes is the fact that investors are provided with a wide range of incentive packages. For example, if you are an investor interested in R&amp;D, then you can benefit from the incentive package that is exclusively prepared for R&amp;D and innovation activities. That is why various global companies have recently announced investment projects in R&amp;D and innovation by establishing their R&amp;D centers in Turkey. For example, Roche, Pfizer, Fiat, Mercedes-Benz, Huawei, General Mobile, Bosch, Siemens, GE, Oracle, Intel, Alcatel-Lucent, Microsoft, ST Ericsson, and Nortel; they all have invested in a growing Turkey. Other incentive schemes have been introduced to attract investors with diverse backgrounds. Region-based incentive schemes offer very favorable conditions for investors, while a large-scale based incentive package provides investors with incentives regardless of the region in which they invest. To put it in a nutshell, investors have a wide range options to realize their investments benefitting from various incentive schemes.</p><h4>In which sectors are you seeing the most investor interest, and which sectors do you feel represent the greatest untapped potential?</h4><p>Investors are interested in many promising sectors ranging from finance to energy. Plenty of opportunities are available in automotive, ICT, energy, renewable energy, pharmaceutical, agro-food, petrochemicals, and so on. To begin with, energy is a very important sector for several reasons, first, in order to meet Turkey's growing demand for energy, more than $100 billion worth investment is required. The economy is growing rapidly, and by the same token, energy demand is growing in parallel with economic growth. Secondly, Turkey's geostrategic position makes it a key energy corridor and terminal, as around 70% of global energy resources are located in the south and the east of Turkey, while the largest consumer, Europe, is located to the west of Turkey. Thirdly, renewable energy is a rising sector in Turkey, as the country's renewable resources are yet to be fully utilized. Moreover, the government is committed to increasing the share of renewable energy in energy generation, and to this end a new renewable energy law has been introduced, providing investors with incentives and feed-in tariffs.</p><p>Further privatization and developments in the energy sector will also create quite profitable opportunities for global investors. Global investors also have the opportunity to cooperate with the public sector through public private partnership (PPP) projects. The national and local authorities have been implementing numerous investment projects through PPP, ample opportunities are awaiting global investors in education, energy, defense, health, transportation, and other public services provided by local governments. Another exciting area of investment is finance; as you may know Istanbul is developing  into an international financial center. The government launched the project, “Istanbul Finance Center", to make Istanbul a regional financial center from where global companies could manage their financial operations in the region.</p><h4>Which source countries are the most active in Turkey, and do you anticipate significant changes in Turkey's investor base?</h4><p>Investors from the EU still constitute the bulk of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Turkey—around 70% of FDI inflows come from the EU. Such a solid fact suggests that European investors have already admitted Turkey into the EU business architecture, while politicians are lagging behind them. US investors are also very active in Turkey, as at country level, US investors are at the top of the FDI tables in Turkey. Nevertheless, we are seeing a growing interest by investors from the Arab Peninsula, which have realized multi-billion worth investment projects in Turkey in recent years.</p><h4>How does ISPAT facilitate the activities of foreign investors?</h4><p>The Agency, which was established in 2006, offers global investors a wide range of services. Since its foundation, ISPAT has been providing assistance to investors before, during, and after their entry into Turkey. It serves as a reference and contact point for international investors by linking them with both the government and businesses in Turkey. Working on a fully confidential basis and acting like a private venture, the Agency is trustworthy and adaptable. ISPAT's free services include, but are not limited to, providing market information and analyses, site selection, B2B meetings, coordination with relevant governmental institutions, facilitating legal procedures and applications, such as establishing business operations, incentive applications, and obtaining licenses and work and residence permits. Being attached to the Prime Ministry and directly reporting to the Prime Minister provides the Agency with operational freedom and flexibility. Similarly, coordination and cooperation with all governmental organizations enables ISPAT to facilitate investment processes promptly and effectively. Since its establishment, the Agency has carried out global campaigns to raise awareness about investment opportunities in Turkey. Having successfully implemented these campaigns, the Agency is now focusing on specific countries, sectors, and in some cases specific companies in order to get concrete results. In this regard, we see investors as clients and client satisfaction is a top priority for us.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the Turkish economy?</h4><p>Well, predictions are difficult to make, but when it comes to Turkey, it is very easy to make predictions confidently. Let me elaborate a little bit; as you may already know, the Turkish economy has shown remarkable performance with its steady growth over the past eight years. A sound macroeconomic strategy in combination with prudent fiscal policies and major structural reforms in effect since 2002 have integrated the Turkish economy into the globalized world, while transforming the country into one of the major recipients of FDI in its region, attracting around $94 billion in the past eight years. With an average annual growth rate of approximately 5% over the past eight years, Turkey has been the fastest growing economy in the region. Turkey's robust economic performance in 2010 has sealed its success in gold stars, growing by 8.9%. Turkey was the fastest growing economy in Europe and was among the top performers in the OECD in 2010. Turkey's strong economic growth has continued beyond that, which accelerated to 11% in the first quarter of 2011, thus standing out as the fastest growing economy in the world. Now that we have such a strong economic background, we can easily make predictions about Turkey that promise confidence and growth. That is why credible international institutions are so confident about Turkey's economic future. The OECD forecasts that the Turkish economy will grow by an impressive average annual growth rate 6.7% between 2011 and 2017. Similarly, Goldman Sachs has projected that Turkey will emerge as the ninth largest economy in the world and third largest economy in Europe by 2050.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the motive behind VARYAP's move to real estate and PPP projects?</h4><p>VARYAP started its business back in 1974, focusing on government and state projects. In the past decade, however, VARYAP has shifted more toward the commercial real estate and PPP sectors. Our core developments are defined with a vision in order to differentiate and make the company stand out from a very saturated market here in Turkey. Our ambition is to be market leaders, with an insight into setting new standards to redefine the industry's expectations, needs, and quality levels. Sizing our market has helped us identify and target a niche group of customers constantly seeking new innovations and areas of investment. The relentless development and increased popularity of our country has created a significant demand and need for more commercial spaces. Therefore, in order to keep up with our booming economy and cultural values, we have focused our projects concentrating on technology and design, implementing architectural and environmental means deemed fit for society's wellbeing. We acknowledge and ensure that we have a wide range of portfolio diversity with a continuous increase in distinction. VARYAP is constantly working toward sustainable and achievable growth, and relates to its customers as partners.</p><h4>Which projects demonstrate this approach to the market?</h4><p>The most distinguishable move demonstrating our stance was the launch of VARYAP Meridian in 2008. The project was the first of its kind in Turkey, combining LEED gold criteria with internationally renowned architects—RMJM was chosen from an international competition organized on our behalf—exposing esthetical and environmental-friendly living, office, and recreational spaces. Our goal was to design and develop a worldwide-recognized project in Ataşehir, Istanbul. Bearing in mind the credit crunch hit its peak in 2009, the timing was very critical and many pundits said we wouldn't be able to complete such a large project, estimated at $1 billion in size. However, VARYAP trusted its potential and the economy to go forward with Meridian. Around 20% of future apartments were put on sale that same year, recording astonishing sales figures within the first month—280 units were sold. This further reinstated our strong assurance in this project. Currently, 90% of the construction is complete, 85% of the project has been sold, and 400 units are already occupied, with the remaining units due to be delivered by the end of 2012. Thus far, we can say it has been a tremendously successful project given the economic circumstances.</p><div class="quote">“We believe our success lies within the management of our resources and services."</div><h4>Why was VARYAP Meridian such a success, despite the timing?</h4><p>We believe our success lies within the management of our resources and services. In our opinion, the most important and influential aspect of the project was the means to finance it. Our customers were offered a 300% premium rate at the inauguration of the project, to be returned within three years. It was an astonishing number in terms of investment returns, but this is why at this time many real estate development companies are investing in Turkey. The country has a need for more households, and there are four important motives behind this; we have a young population, high seismic risks—55% of houses are unlicensed, and may collapse during an earthquake—and we are a developing nation with increasing purchasing power, and, culturally, owning a house is the first investment a family typically undertakes. Looking at the investment volume in Turkey, the rate of mortgages is at 4% of GDP; in certain countries at times this finds itself above 100%, so it can be said ours is comparatively low. Bearing in mind these statistics Turkey still has a long way to go, but we see a promising future that gives us the confidence to take on and realize further projects of such a high caliber.</p><h4>VARYAP Meridian was designed by a UK firm. What do you foresee for the future of Turkish architecture?</h4><p>There are some very good Turkish architects producing designs that meet international standards, yet more are needed as we aim to raise awareness of the attractiveness existent in Turkey's architectural background. Education is an important factor behind the development of local talent, which is why we are in contact with universities to exchange ideas and know-how. VARYAP has also founded an academy to educate the architects currently on board, sending them abroad with various assigned tasks. Hence, even within our company, we have a small institution emerging to encourage the local architects.</p><h4>What role do you see the private sector taking in this new wave of demand?</h4><p>The private sector plays an important and integral role in meeting the demand of this new trend. We are committed to contributing to urban regeneration efforts by bringing in VARYAP's experience and vision. To this end, VARYAP is interested in and working on some projects in various districts of Istanbul such as Beşiktaş, Zeytinburnu, Bakırköy, and Kadıköy. We believe the local people, private sector, and public offices can create a synergy in the best interests of all. At the front of the urban regeneration issue, VARYAP will be more active and it will be introducing world-class benchmarks in the years to come.</p><h4>Considering the new property reciprocity law that may be passed in the near future, what is the profile of international clients that you have?</h4><p>Once again, we have to reiterate that Turkey is a leading country in our region with a stable economy and political system. The constantly increasing price levels over the last two or three years is not very common elsewhere. That said, a lot of foreigners are trying to make substantial investments in our field of operations. Nonetheless, we are of firm belief that the real demand will come from Central Asia, the Far East, the Middle East, and Russia. Although we did not do any global marketing of any kind, 6% of VARYAP Meridian sales went to foreign investors. There were no established sales channels and the majority of clients came, found us, and consequently bought, in general, through a company. If the reciprocity law passes, we will see an increased demand trend mainly from Russia and the Middle East.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ghadir Investment is one of the biggest companies on Tehran's stock exchange. How did it come to be such a major economic actor?</h4><p>After the Revolution the banks had a large number of companies transferred to them, but the banks had no center to manage them. This company was created by Saderat Bank to manage some of these new subsidiary companies that came into its ownership. Little by little, these companies were managed and restructured to achieve profitability. And now, fortunately, we have created a company with a huge amount of capital and investments spread across many fields of the economy. Companies like Ghadir Investment have a lot of influence over Iran's economy.</p><p>In Iran, the economy can be analyzed by dividing it into three elements. First is the central government, and just as in every other country the government has influence over the economy's performance. But as you know, in Iran the government still plays a large role in the economy. The second element to understanding the Iranian economy is the private sector, while the third is the cooperative companies that have been set up. The situation in Iran has been changing substantially and the private sector is having a larger influence over the direction of the economy. However, the further implementation of this strategy requires intermediary companies such as Ghadir Investment.</p><h4>How would you define your role in the transition from a state-dominated to a more private sector-friendly economy?</h4><p>We occupy a special position as an interface and link between the investor community and a wide variety of projects. We are here for the intermediate phase between state ownership and private sector leadership. Fortunately, the government in Iran responsibly noticed this matter and sought to provide us with the authority to exert our influence over aspects of the economy. For example, at the moment we own a number of large assets in the petrochemical sector. The government sold some petrochemical plants to us about five years ago and we have managed them and transformed them into profit centers. Our petrochemical companies reported profits of some $300 million in the previous year.</p><h4>Besides being experts of management, what other characteristics does the company hold?</h4><p>Not only the experts, we also have the proper connections to the government. We have the investor, we have the idea, now we have to organize and strategize this job together. We need to obtain permissions, and we are able to get permissions. We need a natural gas supply. We get the natural gas supply. We have the ability to talk to the various ministries in the government and successfully work out how to satisfy all the regulatory permissions needed for a project to go ahead. We were a semi-governmental organization, and so we understand how the government works and have worked together with it many times in the past. However, we are now a fully private company whose shareholders are all, without exception, from the private sector. Despite this, government offices have confidence in us because of our good background and sound economic performance.</p><h4>Will you sell the companies grouped under Ghadir Investment to other private sector players?</h4><p>We have some smaller companies that we are selling directly to the private sector. Little by little, though, our position will change from the smaller companies to the larger ones. Although, when we want to sell larger companies to the market we usually use the stock exchange as the preferred vehicle.</p><h4>How many employees do you have here in management, and how many across the Ghadir group of companies?</h4><p>In the main company headquarters we have about 50 people, though you have to remember we have five holding companies and each of these has a group of companies underneath it. Ghadir Investment has about 80 subsidiary companies with a total employee account of around 7,000 people. Our revenues in the past financial year amounted to about $20 billion, while our profits for the year were something in the range of $500 million. We have already surpassed this amount in the current financial year. Our strategy for the coming five years is to achieve annual profits of $1.2 billion.</p><h4>Do you see Iran as a safe place for investment?</h4><p>Yes. There are many different investment opportunities in Iran, and this is quite important. For example, in 2009 the stock market had a good year. We sold a company through some brokers on the stock market, and they received a 60% profit in one year. It is because of such gains that many expatriate Iranians want to come back to Iran and invest in our market. For example, we recently created a fund for expatriate Iranians and we are promoting it globally. As a result of this fund, we are able to support a number of projects in Iran. We have a lot of profitable projects going on locally in different fields, and the demand from expatriate Iranians to invest has been very strong.</p><h4>How would you describe the investment strategy of your company?</h4><p>Ghadir Investment tries to connect the government and the private sector, and the sources of wealth and the people. In this strategy we try to gather together all of the investment companies in Iran in order to improve the ability of the economy to generate wealth and create synergies between different enterprises. Ghadir Investment has some very talented staff, and our personnel all understand that what we do is more than about the aims of the company, it is also about the aims of the nation. We want to bring many investment companies together and through the synergies generated and various forms of syndication we can finance bigger and better projects that will benefit the future of the country.</p><h4>What new projects are you thinking of investing in the areas of IT, tourism, and high-tech?</h4><p>Along with our R&amp;D division, we have looked a great deal into this matter and we are trying to find the best fields of investment that we can. We specialize in two kinds of business generally: asset-based and knowledge-based. We try to divide all businesses into these two broad groups, and we are looking to switch from being overweight in asset-based businesses and improve our coverage of knowledge-based businesses. We think that in the future the best business will come from knowledge-based enterprises, not asset-based businesses. For example, cement companies are asset-based, while tourism is more of a knowledge-based business.</p><p>We think we will be successful by switching little by little. We believe our strategy will be the new model for the other investment companies in Iran to follow, and I have tried to convince the other companies to consider this strategy.</p><p>At the moment we are thinking about the Ghadir brand. In the past people noticed that we had a good and credible name. At the moment, though, we don't use this added value that the brand can generate. It is time to market Ghadir Investment as a brand in itself.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Mines (ICCIM) was founded in 1969 (or 1348 in the Iranian calendar) with the aim of supporting the private sector. In fact, as a civil institution ICCIM actively supports Iran's sustainable development and utilizes its committed human capital to realize its objectives in accordance with the nation's needs, while securing its members' interests.<br></p><p>ICCIM is committed to helping develop the country's economic system, improve the status of the private sector, create a suitable entrepreneurial environment within Iran, and remove any barriers standing in the way of business. The organization seeks to enhance the economic status of Iran globally, upgrade the level of economic thinking within society, and encourage the participation of the people in different economic fields. As a group, we consult with both public and private sector leaders, take part in economic decision-making processes, organize data resources, and provide information on various areas of the national and international economy.</p><h4>WTO ACCESSION</h4><p>Nowadays, little doubt remains about the necessity of Iran's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)—becoming a member country has turned into a must. Gaining access to the global marketplace at a competitive level will help facilitate the efficient utilization of our available production resources. Fortunately, the significance of WTO membership is well known by many of the country's policymakers. As a result, in 1992 a taskforce was formed in the Ministry of Commerce and after two years of consultations on this issue the government decided that it was essential to accept the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</p><p>Also, in recent years major strides have been taken to improve Iran's integration with the world economy. In 1999, an advanced training course on international trade negotiations, centering on the WTO and its processes, was initiated at the Institute for Trade Studies and Research in order to train trade negotiators for the Islamic Republic of Iran's Trade Representative office.</p><p>A Council for the Coordination of Ministers on WTO Affairs was presided over by the Minister of Commerce in October-November 2000. The Minister of Commerce was appointed the trade representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran by presidential decree in 2001.  As well, the Minister of Commerce was approved as the trade representative for the Islamic Republic of Iran by the cabinet in accordance with the multi-sectoral document of accession to the WTO in 2005.</p><p>The first examination of Iran's request to join the WTO took place at the WTO's general assembly on May 8, 2001. Afterwards, the accession request and the establishment of Iran's accession working party was processed at the 23rd round of the general council of the WTO, and at its conclusion Iran was accepted as an observing member on May 26, 2005.</p><p>In 2006 the explanatory report of Iran's process of accession to the WTO was drawn up by the Islamic Republic of Iran's Trade Representative with the aim of systematically managing the accession process and designating the duties and responsibilities of the administrative organizations. Thereafter, in 2007, the ninth edition of the report on the Islamic Republic of Iran's trade regime met the approval of a working party composed of the elected ministers of the cabinet.</p><p>After submitting the report of the trade regime of the WTO, the first series of questions of the WTO's working party were received and thereafter they underwent initial scrutiny by the Islamic Republic of Iran's Trade Representative, which ended in the dispatching of questions to 55 relevant organizations along with guidelines on answering the questions. The WTO accession process is ongoing, and we naturally look forward to a successful conclusion after many years of negotiations.</p><h4>REFORM PROCESS</h4><p>In recent years, Iran's economy has undergone a number of measures in different economic areas that have changed it at both the micro and macro level. Prominent among these measures include the announcement of Article 44, the privatization process, the growth of the capital markets, the improved targeting of subsidies, the formation of a competition council, and the establishment of a national wealth fund. These measures, if implemented properly, will have a macroeconomic impact on areas such as the rate of inflation, unemployment, poverty, and the development of the private sector. The existing conditions in the economy provide a useful backdrop to undertake such major structural reforms.</p><p>A closer look at the economic reform process in Iran reveals that it is an economic project whose management needs to be defined at the government level. That is to say, all components of the state should be aligned to modify the 80-year-old legacy of Iran's economic history over the course of a single decade.</p><h4>FDI CONNECTION</h4><p>Iran is brimful of investment opportunities in numerous production and service fields for foreign investors. It is an attractive destination because of its abundant natural resources, low-cost and skillful labor force, strategic and favorable geographical location, and proximity to other emerging markets.</p><p>Currently, tax, customs, and financial incentives as well as free trade zones and infrastructural incentives are available in Iran in order to promote investment. These are determined and implemented by the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI). Also, some amendments have been made to the foreign investment law by OIETAI that are all aimed at improving the investment environment and promoting conditions for the presence of investors. In fact, it should be emphasized that the new investment law, which encourages and supports foreign investment, will provide the opportunity for investment in all areas of Iran's economy. By the same token, nothing stands in the way of foreign investment, and investment activities are not blocked in any areas except for those concerning national security. On this basis, investors can embark on investing in Iran in many different ways.</p><h4>REGIONAL RELATIONS</h4><p>The contemporary world is constructed upon the basis of an interaction between countries. In fact, economies are far from being isolated and closed systems. Nowadays, economic and trade ties between countries are viewed as crucial strategies for increasing competitive potentials and raising the level of public prosperity. Iran is no exception to this, and undoubtedly boosting its ties with other countries will substantially influence Iran's economic development.</p><p>Of course, having trade ties with countries that are geographically close to Iran is of greater significance, as it entails lower transaction costs and the level of cultural affinity makes relationships easier to form. Iran has always attempted to expand its trading ties with regional and African countries as they hold golden opportunities for the export of Iranian products. Evidently, Iranian investors, businessmen, and exporters of technical and engineering services have performed well in these areas and they all welcome such opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Let's Define Development]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[lets-define-development]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the developments in the Iranian economy in the wake of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP)?</h4><p>Before I answer your question, let us first set a definition for development. For instance, development has a standard definition, but internally we have another way of looking at it. We position the progression of development alongside the upholding of justice. What do we mean by justice? Justice means that everybody capable of having a talent or skill should be given the opportunity to exercise that talent, whether in social, cultural, or economic affairs. In other words, in justice, we should help those classes and strata of people who have had a historical disadvantage to achieve a higher standard of living and let them participate in the competitive sphere. If one has such an outlook, then the priority in having development will be different from others. Before the Revolution there were about 70,000 university students, and now there are 3 million students in the universities. This shows how we gave priority to human development over other forms of development. We are one of the top countries for human development, and this development started from our small villages right up to our big cities. The sweet fruit of that is the high level of knowledge and scientific production that we have today. You see that in different realms and fields of science where we are at the cutting edge. The news was recently announced that Iran was the first country to achieve the industrial production of bio-implants, which are used for eye surgery. We even preceded researchers in the US, who were only doing bio-implants on a laboratory scale. The other priority that we are working on is the fair distribution of incomes and to achieve a Gini coefficient at a normal and plausible level. The inequality in income distribution is quite high in Iran and we are trying to moderate it. The other point is investment in infrastructure development. In the past we decided to give more significance to the development of financial and manufacturing infrastructure. For instance, investment in petrochemicals, power plants, and hydro dams.</p><h4>How do you think these policies will affect the future of the country?</h4><p>We firmly believe that they will play a key role in the future. The country's 20-year vision states that we should be ranked first in development terms and have the highest per capita income in the region by 2025. If we assume that today the per capita income in the region is about $20,000, we presume it will be about $30,000 by 2025. This means that we need to achieve an annual 8% growth rate.</p><h4>What should be done to reach 8% annual growth from the current level of 2%?</h4><p>We hope that over time the pace of growth will increase. For instance, on infrastructural issues we are trying to execute two general policies. One is Article 44, and the other is the subsidy direction code. They mean we have to speed up privatization efforts, remove energy subsidies, and create more targeted subsidies for the poor. We forecast that by having these two policies executed there will be an acceleration of economic growth.</p><h4>What are the implications of these two reforms on the country's growth trajectory?</h4><p>Transparency and saving will affect the growth of the country positively. On only the question of energy alone, the government is paying $100 billion to support energy subsidies. This is five times more than the development budget. Imagine if that $100 billion were to be transferred to the development budget of the country. We can do it as soon as possible. It would have its own implications on the development of different fields, such as the economy, social affairs, and politics. Though I am not a man of politics, part of our development as we have defined it is the development of the nation's presence in the international arena. As was predicted in the 20-year vision for the country, in the coming decades Iran will achieve a much higher interaction with all countries in the region and in the world as a whole. This interaction means that we shall find a place in the world that is compatible with our level of achievement. What we are doing in the international affairs arena is to express that we have our own rights and prerogatives in the region and the whole world to prove to ourselves. It is one of the foundations of development. If we view all these pieces together, it shows that all of us are getting ready to take a big leap forward. Taking into account the different aspects of geo-strategy, geo-geography, and geo-economy along with the other parameters, it shows we have the potential to make that great leap.</p><p>We are a country with a population some 74 million. Over 50-60% of the population is under 30 years old. We have 5 million university graduates. We have huge reserves of energy, which makes our country first or second in the world. We have a very strategic geographical location that makes this country the gate between East and West, North and South. Another point to boast about it is the fact that Iran has 3,000 years of written history. There are very few civilizations like that. There were many challenges and hurdles in the course of history, but the nation successfully passed through all of them. Therefore, there is an innate ability of managing and challenging international problems. Some countries are only 100 years old. The most significant advantage we have over all of them is that we have an integrated strategic management system. While the operational offices are working in different corners of the country, there is a grand vision that moves the entire nation toward a single goal.</p><h4>Where do you see foreign direct investment (FDI) in upping the pace of economic growth? How is this chamber looking to increase FDI levels?</h4><p>FDI has a key role to play in the advancement of the country's economy. Let me give you some figures. In the next five-year plan under completion, to maintain 8% growth and help us achieve the final goals we will need $1,000 billion in investment in the coming five years. It is a big gap from the $3 billion we receive now, but we will try to compensate this figure with $300 billion from oil revenues. We have also forecast the ability to generate $300 billion from other resources like taxes. Then we are left with $300 billion-$400 billion. This is the share that we have allocated for FDI. The question is, how can we get to the final figure? It goes back to many parameters like foreign policy, internal issues, and other matters. Generally, we are optimistic, and there are many other parameters that can help. For instance, we plan to have $500 billion in investment in the oil sector over the coming five years. That is a must. Investment this year in Iran, in terms of the turnover of invested money and capital and the benefits and revenue that they generate, cannot be compared with any other place in the region. In our country, a project can be viable even at interest rates of 20%, while in neighboring countries a rate over 10% is not economic. In terms of internal consumption, we have a market of 70 million people, and to this can be added the 200 million to 300 million people in the neighboring region. There are huge opportunities for investment. Although there are some political issues and international matters, we believe we can cope with them. Therefore, we see that there is an opportunity to absorb $300 billion-$400 billion in FDI. If we mobilize our nationals living overseas, they can provide that. This figure is not as high as it first appears.</p><h4>As the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, do you provide any services to potential foreign investors?</h4><p>Internally, we provide different services to our members. It is part of the various tasks we specialize in at the chamber. On international issues, through the cooperation and communication that we have with our government, we render many services to support different activities, such as investment support, legal support, business support, information, and any other form of support that an investor may need to obtain contacts. We hold seasonal, regional, and international seminars for investors to get to know Iran better. We invite the chambers of different countries to Iran to give them the opportunity to improve their knowledge of Iran. We also have joint chambers, like Iran-China, or Iran-Canada, where the active members get together and exchange information and visits. One of the other functions of the chamber is to play the role of consultant. In the case of disputes it plays the role of arbitrator, giving legal support to the parties. We encourage the establishment of joint ventures in different fields.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background information on Saman Bank? When was the bank established?</h4><p>We started our activities in September 1999. Basically, we received the first general license for a non-bank credit institute, and this was the first such license granted by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to a private entity after the Islamic Revolution. Based on the capital requirement for a credit institute at the time, we started with $1.1 million in fully paid capital. It is worth noting that we applied for the license two years prior to receiving it. The ex-governor of the CBI, Dr. Noorbakhsh, was in favor of the privatization of financial institutions to boost the sector's competition, dynamism, and development, and he managed to convince the Parliament to permit the issuance of such licenses. The CBI started with granting licenses for non-bank credit institutes. The only point that distinguished them from a bank was not having the permission to open current accounts and issue checkbooks. All other services, including deposit taking and granting loans, were permissible. Two years after that the CBI announced it would start granting banking licenses, and credit institutes that could increase their capital to $20 million were able to apply for one. We followed suit and started increasing our capital to $20 million as well. We were the third institution to receive a license purely due to the fact that all our shareholders were and are from the private sector with manufacturing backgrounds. Accumulating the required capital was a huge task and time consuming, given the fact that they did not want to dilute the ownership of the bank. EN Bank and Karafarin Bank received their licenses before we did. Currently, EN Bank is rightly using this claim to be “the first private bank of IR Iran" in its branding and advertisements. Actually, at the beginning only four credit institutes were granted a license in a short span of time, and we were the first to be granted a general license. Later on EN and Karafarin managed to increase their capital sooner than we did. I must say that, however, we were the trend setter, by introducing many new concepts. In fact the software we developed for our operations is being used by almost all private banks today, and the IT company we established is now one of the largest independent IT banking solution providers in the country.</p><h4>How many branches do you have throughout Iran?</h4><p>We have 120 branches at present with another 10 branches under construction. When we devised our strategy at the very beginning for 2001-2006 we produced a five-year plan focusing on product innovation by utilizing IT, and the opening of 250   branches. And during this time a lot of parameters changed, and so did our plan. We introduced a new branch concept to the market. Traditionally, branches in Iran were designed in a way that 70% of the space was allocated to employees and 30% to customers. We changed this concept. We made it an open-stand branch. We allocated 70% of the space to clients and only 30% to our staff. And because we had the proper technology, we were able to reduce the number of employees per branch. Let me make a comparison. In its Bazaar branch, Bank Melli has more than 150 employees and we managed to run our Bazaar branch with 14 employees. We are talking about more than $120 million worth of deposits in one branch. Then we increased that number from 14 to 20. Among the private sector banks, the per branch deposit level is between $40 million and $42 million, whereas with state-owned banks it is about $4 million to $6 million. This comparison can easily be used as an index for efficiency, which means that private banks are 10 times more efficient than public banks in that respect. In terms of deposits per branch our ranking hovers between second and third after Parsian Bank and Bank Pasargad.</p><h4>Do you think this is because you are working mainly with companies?</h4><p>No, this is the case because we focus mainly on service. We are offering superior service, we care for our customers, we open branches in very convenient locations, and we have larger branches. The design is very important: We do not use counters, you can come and sit down in our branch and a branch manager can do all of your tasks from just withdrawing cash to processing loans. There is no going from one counter to another, which was the traditional way of banking.</p><h4>How did the strategy of the bank change in its first five years?</h4><p>During the first five years of operations, the competition changed because the government started offering new licenses to other banks. From the private sector, Parsian Bank entered the market, and Pasargad and Sarmaye started up their businesses. Now the structure of competition has changed. We had to focus more on electronic banking to maintain our lead and our edge in comparison with others. We established the very first Payment Service Provider (PSP) company by installing EFT-POS terminals in shops and retail outlets. So if I come back to the strategy of the bank, we were mainly focusing on the retail side. Although we did not have many branches available nationwide, we were mainly focused on retail and SMEs. The main reason for this was CBI regulations. You could not lend more than 20% of your capital base to one entity and its related parties or project, and of $20 million capital, 20% is just $4 million. So we could not approach large organizations needing $50 million or $100 million in financing. Therefore, we had to focus on SMEs and retail services to attract deposits. We were the first in many items, having had our strategy sketched around innovation. We were the first bank to introduce commercial papers, credit cards at a mass level, internet and mobile banking services, sharia-based overdraft facility, and the list continues.</p><h4>Credit cards are very important for retail banking. Why does your bank only issue them to customers who are SME owners?</h4><p>The only reason that we are unable to issue them en masse is that we do not have a proper credit-scoring agency in place, and so we have to take collateral to issue credit cards. This is why we cannot issue unsecured loans on a very large scale. We have issued 36,000 credit cards, and it is at present a special service for those customers who maintain deposits with us.</p><h4>How many customers do you currently have and what percentage are internet customers?</h4><p>In terms of customer numbers, we have just under 1 million, out of which we have more than 220,000 internet banking users. If we compare this to the more mature Western markets this is not a good ratio, but in this society it is amazing. Other banks have less than 10% of their customers using internet banking, though we are maintaining 23%. That is why we have been able to attract clients who are more educated. The average age of our clients is 34, they are mainly holding a bachelor's degree or a diploma at least, and they generally run their own companies and businesses.</p><h4>How do you plan to increase your capital?</h4><p>As I said, we started with $1.1 million; right now our paid up capital stands at  $225 million. This is the result of organic growth plus three capital increases through rights issues. The first one was to $20 million when we applied for a fully fledged banking license. The second one was from $25 million to $60 million, and the third one was from $90 million to $180 million. Having had a Return on Average Equity (ROAE) of more than 25% consistently for the past 10 years contributed significantly to our current capital level.</p><p>For the past couple of years, the CBI has changed regulations on the minimum capital necessary for a bank. It initially set it at $20 million, then after two years at $200 million, then $350 million, and now we have to increase our capital to $400 million by the end of March 2011 to maintain our license. This is why we changed our strategy between 2002 and 2007. And you see a lot of volatility in terms of regulations. The instability in regulations makes doing business difficult. We can increase our capital organically through our performance and our profitability, but when you are obliged to triple your capital in a very short span of time it becomes a different story. Then you have to bring in more money, fresh capital, from new investors. Bringing in a new investor in Iran is a very challenging task too. You need to have good partners that will be willing to stay with you on a long-term basis in order to maintain the stability of the organization. In a bank you cannot change partners every two years. Within a board you need consistency and long-term planning, since in a bank, unlike other organizations, you are working with peoples' cash, money, and funds. It is not a privately owned venture per se in which you can do whatever you would like. Consistency and stability in terms of decision-making in a bank to me is a first priority. However, if you have to increase your capital in the way that the Central Bank of Iran requires, you need to bring in new partners because you cannot increase your capital only through your profitability. This is why it was a big challenge for us in particular. Yet, up to now we have managed to increase our capital and maintain the stability and consistency of our board members. The board members of Saman Bank have never changed over the last 10 years.</p><h4>How did you solve the problem of increasing your capital?</h4><p>We intend to do the increase to $400 million locally. For that we have prepared a workable plan. Some $100 million of it comes from this year's profit, and the first six months' results are looking quite promising. Another $75 million we will do through a rights issue.</p><h4>What does the CBI seek to achieve by increasing the minimum capital requirements for private banks?</h4><p>There are two objectives. One was to reduce competition, because the CBI had many applications for licenses. However, the second thing is that the private banking sector in Iran grew quite tremendously and we have to manage our capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Right now we are hovering around 10% in terms of CAR, but to be categorized as a sound bank you have to be at least above 12 or 13%. The minimum requirement is 8%, of which we are well above, but to be on the safe side it is better to be above 12 or 14%. Higher than that and you are not properly utilizing deposits, and lower than that you are exposed to greater risk. However, based on Basel II requirements, which we implemented last year and disclosed in our 2009 Annual Report, our CAR ratio is 13%. The CBI's guideline states that we have to comply with Basel I requirements, but it has sent us some new guidelines stating that we have to start working on Basel II.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-7-minute-miracle]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind Bank Tejarat's establishment?</h4><p>Bank Tejarat was formed 31 years ago after the merger of 12 banks following the Revolution. Most of these banks had a bi-national nature and were merged with other foreign banks. Iran-Netherlands, Iran-Japan, Iran-Russia and the like could be regarded as some of them. Thus, it benefits from a very strong potential in terms of international banking. Three years ago, Bank Tejarat was ranked fifth in Iran in the area of deposits, and now it is the fourth. Regarding bank guarantees, we are the leader in the Iranian market with a 39% market share. Regarding letters of credit (LCs), we are considered to be the second largest provider in Iran. In terms of deposits as well as credits we hold a 17% market share amongst the five largest commercial banks of Iran. Since the privatization of Bank Tejarat we have improved these ratios remarkably. Furthermore, the bank also possesses a very good status among the public.</p><h4>Who are your main clients? Businessmen, exporters…</h4><p>As you know Tejarat means “commerce" in Farsi. Thus, the main area of our work is commerce and trade. This doesn't mean that we're not working in the field of industry. For example, last year about 35% of our credit facilities were dedicated to the industrial sector. About 20% of the rest was dedicated to agriculture. However, the capabilities of this bank for trade cooperation are very high.</p><h4>When did the privatization of Bank Tejarat occur and what was the effect on the bank's vision and policies?</h4><p>It happened more than a year ago. Privatization has been of great benefit to this bank, allowing us to carry out our business and responsibilities with greater profitability. Naturally, in this process our customers and the public, as well as our shareholders, will benefit. This will consequently lead to economic growth and the empowerment of the country. There is a rule in economics that if an action is based on logic, then profitability will increase such that it will increase wealth in the country. For example, during the last year more than 70% of government shares were sold to the public, and this year another 10% or so will be sold. In our understanding, the income of the government has increased from different dimensions.</p><h4>How did the effects of privatization on Bank Tejarat differ from its effects on other banks?</h4><p>I believe that in every private bank we should change our attitudes toward privatization before distributing and selling shares. The attitude that we hold here is more privatized. The support behind this claim is that we have the best situation in terms of the stock exchange. We are the first and only bank whose shares were sold in less than seven minutes on the stock exchange. For the time being, the price of our shares is among the highest. Compared to 2009, when Bank Tejarat first distributed and sold its shares to customers, we recorded a 115% return for investors. For example, if a shareholder bought a share for $100, he or she would have $215 this year.</p><h4>Did privatization change anything in terms of management style?</h4><p>Some of the rules and laws that were unnecessary were set aside and decision-making became faster, so that we decide within our board. Of course, every bank has to work under the supervision of the central bank of its own country, such as is the case in the US, the UK, and in Germany. And we have to act on the same basis. However, our first obligation is to provide profits to our shareholders. I believe that since the bank has been privatized, nothing is more important than the profit we must distribute to our shareholders.</p><h4>More banks are being privatized, and more private banks are entering the industry. How does this increase in competition affect Bank Tejarat?</h4><p>I believe that with more competition among the banks, especially the private ones, customer satisfaction will increase as better services are provided. As you know, the most important factor for our bank is the satisfaction of our customers as well as dedicating more profit to the shareholders. Our motto is “viva competitors".</p><h4>Which area will you focus on more?</h4><p>Our main focus is on bank guarantees, international banking, and other profitable sectors.</p><h4>Foreign banks are now allowed to purchase up to 40% of Iranian banks. How do you think this will affect the Iranian banking system?</h4><p>At present, based on the rules and regulations, the maximum of 40% of the Iranian banks' shares can be purchased for the purpose of investment, which could provide a suitable atmosphere to exchange banking experiences. In case the laws are amended to increase the mentioned percentage, this could help promote the existing interactions and provide more professional competition in the area of banking.</p><h4>How many branches do you have throughout Iran and how many people do you employ?</h4><p>When I first began working as the managing director, we had 2,020 branches. Now, we have 1,950. We are planning to decrease the number of branches that have proved to be not so effective. Since privatization, we have done our best to reduce the number of non-profitable branches. In line with the law, five years after privatization we are allowed to decrease our personnel numbers, but within our bank we are just trying to appoint them to different positions. For example, we are transferring our surplus manpower to the holding as well as to an insurance company that is currently under establishment.</p><h4>For the purpose of establishing such an insurance company, do you collaborate with any other insurance companies in Iran?</h4><p>No, it's a new insurance company—Tejarat Insurance. We are now looking for the required licenses and permissions from Bimeh Markazi Iran. We have delivered our business plan and currently await the regulator's response.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the establishment of Karafarin Bank?</h4><p>Karafarin Bank was initially established as a non-bank credit institution with IR30 billion in capital. The founding shareholders were members of the Association of Industrial Managers of Iran, the Association of Construction Companies of Iran, the Utility Engineers Society, and the Architects and Urban Development Society, together with a group of senior bankers and, of course, the public. It was registered with the Companies Registrar's Office of Tehran in December 1999 and operated as a non-bank credit institution until December 2001. The services currently available from Karafarin Bank cover a wide range from retail to commercial activities, with investment banking also provided.</p><h4>How have the changes in the banking sector, with the growth of private banking interests, affected your bank? Will the privatization of the state-owned banks increase the level of competition in the marketplace?</h4><p>The privatization of the state-owned banks will surely give a new impetus to these developments. Its effect upon the structure of the banking system has been rather limited as it is really in its early stages. The competition has become fiercer with the newer private banks entering the market. Naturally, they want to increase their share of the market in a period of international turmoil and uncertainties for blue-chip investors.</p><p>Karafarin Bank has adopted, since its early days, a rather conservative approach and remains the smallest private bank in size and in terms of the number of branches. This situation was accentuated by the entrance of the new banks. Obviously, if we continued this approach, our share of the market would shrink even further. There is now a slight shift in our policy and our intention is to extend, step by step, our branch network and increase our comparative market share. The fact remains that our profitability has remained high throughout these years.</p><h4>What sort of steps do you think need to be taken to increase the per capita savings rate in Iran?</h4><p>To increase this amount is within the power and prerogative of the monetary authorities and goes well beyond the ways and means of one bank, or even the banking system as a whole; it is basically a function of the growth and the level of national income and its distribution. Be that as it may, for our bank in 2009, the average deposit amounted to some IR108 million (about $10,000). This is a rather respectable amount for the banking system, and is a direct product of Karafarin Bank's strategy of focusing on a smaller number of clients primarily composed of corporate clients and the upper strata income groups.</p><p>As for the term of deposits, our strategy, however, within the permitted leeway (limits on the permitted rates of profit) set by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), has been to concentrate on short-term deposits, including one-year investment deposits. Previously, the CBI accorded a more flexible position to private banks in determining the rate of profit on deposits. This is no longer the case and all banks are subject to the same criteria as regards remunerating depositors. For the banks, the only means of differentiating themselves is by offering better services and through targeted advertising.</p><h4>Where lie the future potential areas for the expansion of credit facilities? Retail, SMEs, or large institutional clients?</h4><p>The potential for investment and the provision of credit in Iran is enormous, as there remains so much to be done. Nonetheless, it is a huge task to determine which projects are viable and where the risks justify bank credit. This is also a structural and fundamental question because it is only through macroeconomic planning and input-output analyses that we can meaningfully determine economic priorities, risk optimization, and how credit distribution should be managed. Bankers mostly operate on the level of microeconomic feasibilities.</p><p>In most countries economic policy makers provide guidelines and supply incentives for the promotion of investment in less-developed sectors, as well as in infrastructure. It would be unrealistic to expect even the well-established state-owned banks to undertake the financing of infrastructure projects, let alone recently established privately owned banks. However, some private banks, including Karafarin Bank, are willing and have the capability to participate in the syndication of projects of national importance. But as a general rule, we finance exclusively private sector projects, and, all things being equal, medium-sized projects are preferred over small ones. Generally, we avoid personal loans.</p><h4>How did the global financial crisis affect your bank and the Iranian economy in general?</h4><p>The banks hardest hit by the crisis were those most exposed to international activities. So as far as Iran was concerned, the immediate effect seemed minimal as the economy was relatively isolated because of various political and economic factors. The oil revenue has also helped to shield the economy. But as the oil sector itself was hit, in turn the whole economy was affected. The economy was already weakened by inflation and faltering investment and was rather vulnerable. Consequently, it is rather hard to precisely determine the negative impact of the international crisis. As for the banks, the enormous increase in their non-performing and doubtful assets from 11% in 2007 to 22% in 2009 must have partly been due to this effect.</p><h4>What role is the CBI providing in terms of supervision over the private banking industry?</h4><p>Previously, privately owned banks were given slightly favorable treatment by the CBI. This is no more the case as of two years ago. We are subject to the same reserve requirements as the state-owned banks and are expected to pay the same rates of profit (interest) as the state-owned banks. Ditto for the sectoral distribution of facilities—the exception being mandatory facilities the state banks are subject to. Otherwise, the difference lies in the slightly different structure of our balance sheets and the choice of Islamic contracts. Last year, the ratio of sight deposits to total deposits was 4.8% for the private banks and 32.7% for the state-owned banks; 82.4% of the private banks' contracts were in the form of participatory contracts, while in the state-owned banks transactional contracts accounted for 71.7% of the contracts.</p><h4>How has the private banking industry grown in Iran, and how much of the market does it now control?</h4><p>There is no precise estimate of the share of the private sector in the economy in recent years. Most economists believe the great bulk of the economy is run by the public sector and semi-public organizations. Nor are there sufficient grounds to assume that it has been rising. But the share of private banks in the banking sector has increased considerably: from 2002 to 2008 their share of total deposits increased from 1.6% to 23%, while facilities rose from 1.2% to 18.6%. As might be expected, gradually the difference between the rate of growth of private banks and that of state banks has narrowed. On the other hand, there are indications that the share of the semi-public sector has been rising, both in the economy as a whole as well as the banking system. Here again the statistics are sparse. For instance, a study of the balance sheets of five non-bank unauthorized financial institutions during a period of 1.5 years ending in February 2009 showed that their share of deposits rose from 8% to 13.4% and the share of their facilities rose from 6.3% to 10.8%—a great leap forward.</p><h4>What do you see as the forward-looking scenario for the Iranian banking industry, and will the regulation allowing foreign investors to have up to a 40% stake change anything?</h4><p>Today, the CBI is dealing with an ever-increasing demand for new licenses, and privately owned banks seem to have carved out a niche for themselves. They now account for between one-fifth and a quarter of the market in terms of total deposits and outstanding credit. The new, more lively competition between the banks has raised the standard of efficiency in the banking system. The private banks have taken over a huge chunk of the unofficial market in which money lenders operated—although some continue to operate—and helped to lower the average rate of profit on credit facilities. We may attribute to them the introduction of new high quality services and, most important of all, transparency. As mentioned before, there seems to be much interest in setting up new banks and there is no dearth of new demand for licenses from the CBI. As a result, we may accept many more private banks. According to the statements made by CBI authorities, the monetary authorities intend to extend their supervision over unauthorized financial institutions. At the same time, the minimum capital requirements are being raised, so that the smaller institutions have to merge. Only recently, two formerly unauthorized institutions put up the capital required and were granted licenses as private banks. Also, last year some 875 credit coops and 5 gharz-al-hasanehs (charity) funds obtained their official permits to operate.</p><p>Most bankers welcome the idea of allowing foreign participation in Iranian banks. This would help open up and extend our international relations and create a more competitive environment. We could only benefit from such a policy and train a new generation of bankers well versed in modern banking techniques. One should, however, expect that initially this policy to be tried in the region and in neighboring countries—its wider application should take several years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The current Iranian Capital Markets Law was passed in 2005. What reasons led to the new law? What is the structure of the Iranian capital markets after the new law?</h4><p>Iran's capital markets have grown fast in the last decade. Before the new law, we had two mercantile exchanges: the Iran Agricultural Commodity Exchange for agricultural products and the Tehran Metal Exchange. Moreover, the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) and its supervisory body were not separated from each other; they were the same company. Based on the new law, the Securities and Exchange Organization (SEO) was established as a public non-governmental organization, while the two exchanges have been demutualized. The SEO became the sole body supervising these exchanges. The two commodity exchanges were merged based on this law and they formed the Iran Mercantile Exchange. The TSE has been reorganized as a publicly owned joint-stock company. It is also required by the law that no person or legal entity can own more than a 2.5% share of the TSE Company. The same is true for the Mercantile Exchange, as well. In the Mercantile Exchange, agricultural products, metals, gold, petrochemicals and oil by-products can be traded. In the near future, we will also have a futures market for crude oil. In addition, an over-the-counter (OTC) exchange (Farabourse Company) has been established where the shares of companies that do not comply with TSE requirements can be traded, while the Central Securities Depository of Iran (CSDI) provides clearing and settlement functions. There are two associations in the capital market, the Brokerage Association and the Financial Investment Institutions' Association. All brokerage firms are members of the former and all investment institutions are the members of the latter. This is the structure of the Iranian capital market. The SEO is the body that supervises all of these institutions.</p><h4>As the supervisory body for Iran's capital markets, what tools do you use to make the markets safer for investors?</h4><p>We supervise all these entities and also the issuers in the capital market. Before the new law, there was no supervision over the primary market. However, according to the new law, we also supervise issuers in the primary market. If the public interest is on the table, the SEO is the supervisory body for that. We supervise public issuers on disclosure issues and the transparent flow of information from issuers, so that enough information is made available to investors.</p><p>We also monitor the transactions in all these exchanges, as transparency is very important in the new law. Under the law, the manipulation and dissemination of incorrect information can be prosecuted by the courts. We also have a special court in the judiciary for the capital market, and so far, in around one-third of cases, the court has convicted those charged.</p><p>Under the new law, we can inspect all the companies under our supervision. They must provide the information the SEO requires for its inspection purposes. The managerial bodies (boards of directors and the managerial directors) of the financial institutions we supervise should also be approved by the SEO. They are selected only on the basis of educational background and experience.</p><p>At the beginning of 2010, another act was passed by Parliament that is complementary to the law of 2005. With this we received useful tax exemptions for new financial instruments like sukuks and any other financial instruments approved by the SEO. Before 2005, we had no mutual funds in the Iranian capital markets, but we now have mutual funds, and we also granted tax exemptions for them with a new regulation in 2010. Mutual funds will increase our capacity to absorb funds in the capital markets, as many people want to invest but do not know how.</p><h4>Given this regulated and safe environment as a result of the new law, do you foresee growth in the Iranian capital markets in the upcoming years?</h4><p>According to the figures we have, last year, which is 1388 in the Iranian solar calendar, we had around $20 billion in total transactions on the TSE and around $10 billion on the Iran Mercantile Exchange. An OTC exchange has only recently been established. This was the biggest volume of transactions we reached since the establishment of the exchange in Iran. In the first four months of 1389 (2010/2011), the volume of transactions on the TSE reached $8 billion and on the Mercantile Exchange $4 billion. We expect the figure will increase more and more this year. Market capitalization was almost $80 billion for the TSE. The rate of return for the TSE was 58% last year, and it has been 34% so far this year.</p><h4>What is the level of foreign investment in the Iranian capital markets?</h4><p>There are Iranians all around the world investing in the Iranian capital market. So far, the role of other foreign investors has been limited, because there used to be some regulations that restricted foreign investment. For instance, foreign investors could not take their initial capital from the TSE for three years. This was a restriction on foreign investment. But in June 2010, the Cabinet of Ministers ratified a new regulation for the TSE that omitted this restriction for foreign investment. Now foreign investors can take their money out—even in one day. Moreover, there are also new central bank currency guarantees. If in the future there are some restrictions regarding the exchange of currencies, the Central Bank of Iran will provide the currency to foreign investors at market rates. This has been recently published and we expect to absorb more foreign investment in the TSE thanks to it.</p><h4>Do you also have growth plans for Islamic financial instruments, such as sukuks?</h4><p>Last year, we only had mushareke sukuk and it recorded $800 million in transaction volumes. This year we will also provide ijareh sukuk. We have jurisprudence over Islamic financial instruments, and have a Sharia Board of five Islamic scholars who oversee whether the new instruments are in line with Islamic law. We have good relationships with other countries' supervisory boards that also have sharia boards like ours. We provide the opportunity to exchange the Iranian experience on Islamic financial instruments with other countries and each year we hold an international seminar on Islamic capital market issues in Tehran. The Iranian capital market fully complies with the sharia, as a result of the Iranian Constitution, and therefore Iran gained much experience in Islamic financial instruments. This is also one of the reasons behind the fact that Iran was less affected by the global economic downturn of 2008-2009.</p><h4>The SEO is part of the ongoing privatization program as the regulatory body of the TSE. How do you see the current status and future of the privatization program?</h4><p>According to Article 44 of Iranian Constitutional Law, many large corporations will be privatized through the TSE. We have around 40 industries in the TSE, meaning that we have a uniquely diversified market in the region. The market's diversification minimizes the risk for investors, because they can create a portfolio of different sectors. So far, privatization has been very fruitful for the Iranian capital markets, especially through the large companies that have been privatized, because we have had new profitable investment areas that could attract investment from the public. We have been successful in absorbing the money coming from the society to buy shares.</p><h4>A futures market has been established on the TSE recently. What are the growth plans for the futures market?</h4><p>We have recently established the single stock futures market in the TSE. Currently, there are only two firms listed on the futures market. We hope to increase the number of listed firms and to design an Islamic index.</p><h4>What role will the capital markets play in achieving the country's macroeconomic goals in the upcoming 10 years?</h4><p>I think, in recent years, we have been successful in the privatization program. At present, 3.5 million people have invested in the TSE, which creates a better distribution of wealth throughout society. Also, being listed on the stock exchange makes a company accountable to its investors, thus the company has to reduce costs, increase its income and become more efficient. We expect the Iranian capital market to absorb a considerable amount of foreign investment, for market capitalization to reach $1,000 billion, and for the Iranian market to become among the top 10 stock exchanges in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY talks to Dr. Mammoud Bahmani, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran.</h4>
<h4>TBY What measures have been taken by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) to improve its supervision over the increased number of private banks active in the Iranian finance sector?</h4>
<div class="numbers-box first aligncenter"></div><p>MAHMOUD BAHMANI Effective banking supervision is among the major prerequisites for a sound economic system, as well as the stability of the financial system, and the building of confidence in this system by reducing the risks faced by depositors and other creditors. The CBI, according to the Monetary and Banking Law of Iran, approved in 1351 (1972/73), fulfills a supervisory function role, thereby ensuring the sound operation of banks and credit institutions as well as the presence of sufficient capital and reserves to counter risks. Thus, the CBI has moved from “supervision compliance“ to “risk-based supervision“. In this regard, the CBI adopted the following measures: restructuring the banking supervision section, formulating prudential regulations, and broadening and expanding the new literature on banking supervision. Therefore, the CBI practices off-site supervision based on the review of the banks’ financial position. As of 1389 (2010/11), the CBI has strengthened its supervisory mechanisms to prepare the ground for on-site supervision, including provincial supervision and inspection by local staff, and to pay more attention to off-site supervision through a careful consideration of prudential ratios.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Money and Credit Council (MCC) set the minimum required capital for the establishment of banks at IR4 trillion, for credit institutions at IR3,500 billion, and for electronic banks at IR2 trillion. Banks and credit institutions that violate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) limits will be downgraded and face restrictions.</p><div class="numbers-box  aligncenter"></div>
<p>At present, the priorities of the supervision section of the CBI for the current year are: preventing the operation of unorganized money market institutions not licensed by the CBI; putting a deposit insurance system into effect; and expanding banking operations in free trade zones.</p><div class="numbers-box  aligncenter"></div>
<p>One of the major banks’ assessments in Iran, as in other countries, is the CAR. The MCC approved a bylaw on capital adequacy in 1382 (2003/04). Based on Article 3 of this bylaw, the minimum CAR for banks and credit institutions was determined at 8% with the stipulation that the CBI could change this ratio for all or some of the banks as need arose.</p>
<p>Moreover, the development of a fair competitive environment, the prevention of banking and credit overexposure, improved financial transparency, and the higher use of IT in the banking system are underlined in Chapter 4 of the Supervisory Policy Package of the Banking System in 1389 (2010/11), approved by the MCC.</p>
<h4>What results do you expect to see from the recent regulation lifting the restriction on foreign investment in Iranian banks?</h4>
<p>Banks enjoy a high share in the Iranian financial market. Moreover, there are many investment projects in Iran as a developing country in which credits are largely financed through the banking system, creating lots of opportunities for banks to make profits. Certainly, lifting the restrictions on foreign investment in the Iranian banking industry may raise the amount of capital inflows to banks.</p>
<h4>Iran is unique in the world with its fully sharia-compliant financial market. It is estimated that the potential of sharia-compliant assets reaches up to $4 trillion globally. What actions are being taken by the CBI to improve the potential of this market?</h4>
<p>In light of the soaring oil prices in recent years and investors’ reluctance to put money into Western financial institutions, there is an increased willingness to deposit with Islamic banks in the region. This is mainly due to higher confidence in the system and the higher deposit rates offered by Islamic banks. Thus, with regard to the huge potential of the Islamic financial market comprising Islamic banking, Islamic insurance, Islamic bonds, and Islamic investment funds, the expansion of this market is expected in the future.</p>
<p>The Islamic Banking Sharia Council was established at the CBI in 1388 (2009/10), and it discusses various issues including guidelines for risk coverage arising from exchange rate fluctuations, sharia procedures for the issuance of bonds in foreign currencies, guidelines for the issuance of foreign exchange certificates of deposit, rules on entering into “debt purchase contracts“ and “debt repurchase contracts“, designing new instruments for the development of the interbank market, and planning for the approval of sharia-compliant procedures for other types of sukuk. The Islamic Banking Sharia Council tries to resolve sharia concerns, and paves the way in designing new Islamic financial instruments.</p>
<p>The formulation, approval, and declaration of the Law for the Development of New Financial Instruments and Institutions was a major step forward in the expansion of the Iranian capital market. Therefore, the High Council of Securities and Exchange took the issue of financial instruments, i.e. sharia-based instruments, into consideration. The introduction of new financial instruments, namely sukuk, and participation papers  issued by the government, municipalities, and investment funds that are transferable on the stock exchange help evolve the capital market and create new opportunities for expanding this market. At present, shares, rights, and corporations’ participation papers are being traded on the capital market. It is expected that the shares of funds will be traded on the stock exchange in the future. Then, it is the turn of debt instruments, in particular sukuk, which would provide a good opportunity for the expansion of the capital market.</p>
<h4>Why did Iran need a new Anti-Money Laundering Law and how is the CBI now authorized to curb illegal money laundering activities?</h4>
<p>The Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Law was approved by the Parliament in January 2008, and it includes 12 chapters. Upon ratification of this law, the pertinent executive bylaw, comprising 49 articles, was approved and declared in December 2009. According to this bylaw, the CBI, as the supervisory body for banks and credit institutions, shall ensure the proper implementation of the AML’s provisions and the pertinent bylaws for banks and credit institutions.</p>
<p>Thus, based on the road map prepared by the Anti-Money Laundering High Council (consisting of the Minister of Commerce, Minister of Intelligence, Minister of the Interior, and the CBI Governor), 11 instructions were prepared by the CBI. The Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance presides over the High Council. The CBI issues the AML-related instructions and circulars, and supervises their proper implementation.</p>
<h4>The CBI recently adjusted the reserve ratios for the banks. Was this part of an attempt to ease the supply of credit to the private sector?</h4>
<p>The CBI reduced the reserve requirement ratios of banks to raise the share of banks’ long-term deposits and strengthen the sustainability of bank deposits. The free reserves of banks, after lowering the reserve requirements, will be used in priority order for the payment of bank debt to the CBI, financing the working capital of productive units and incomplete projects, investment for productive units, interbank loans, and the Mehr Housing Project. On the other hand, the reduction in the reserve requirement ratios increases the money multiplier (considering other variables remain constant) in line with CBI policy on controlling and restricting monetary base growth as well as raising the money multiplier.</p>
<h4>What is the current policy of the CBI regarding inflation? What monetary policy actions need to be taken to sustain the decreasing inflation rate trend?</h4>
<p>The CBI aims at curbing broad money growth, with an emphasis on controlling monetary base growth. Banks’ indebtedness to the CBI as a component of monetary base growth, which surged in 1386 (2007/08), decreased through controlling measures adopted by the CBI such as setting the 34% penalty of overdraft facilities on central bank reserves, and banks’ obligation to extend loans commensurate with their accessible funds. Thus, the continued rise in banks’ indebtedness to the CBI was reduced in 1387 (2008/09), followed by a further decrease in banks’ outstanding debts to the CBI in 1388 (2009/10). This reduction in line with directing banking facilities to priority sectors helped prevent obstacles to financing the real sector.</p>
<p>Other CBI measures, besides controlling the monetary base, include curbing inflationary expectations as well as adopting effective and efficient supervision over banking operations to extend facilities for their true purposes and prevent the involvement of banks’ facilities in speculative activities, all of which play a key role in curbing inflation. Moreover, the CBI may utilize participation papers to reduce monetary base growth if necessary.</p>
<h4>How would you assess the confidence of the public in the banking system? Does Iran need a deposit insurance system to encourage higher saving ratios in the banking system?</h4>
<p>At present, the banks enjoy public trust due to their performance in previous years. Of particular note is that despite such events as the Revolution and the Imposed War, Iranians have never faced any difficulties in withdrawing their deposits from the banking system.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the deposit insurance system is underlined in the Law for Usury (Interest) Free Banking as well as Chapter 2 of the pertinent bylaw of the mentioned law. According to Article 4 of the Law for Usury (Interest) Free Banking, banks are obliged to pay the principal of Gharz-al-hasaneh (savings and current) deposits and may undertake and/or insure the principal of term investment deposits.</p>
<p>Banking deposits must be insured by an independent entity such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund. The deposit insurance system shall be implemented in cooperation with the money market supervisory body and all agent banks. Therefore, one chapter of the new Banking Law is devoted to the establishment, administration, financing and operation of the Deposit Guarantee Fund.</p>
<h4>What steps are being taken on the fiscal side to reduce government debt to more comfortable levels?</h4>
<p>In order to improve the government fiscal position during the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP) period, tax revenues and non-oil resources increased while expenditures decreased.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows that the highest change in tax revenues (excluding tax on oil performance) was related to 1388 (2009/10) and the lowest to 1384 (2005/06). Moreover, the biggest change in non-oil resources occurred in 1386 (2007/08) and 1388 (2009/10). On the other hand, during the Fourth FYDP, growth in government expenses remained relatively unchanged. Government expenses for the years 1386 (2007/08) and 1388 (2009/10) increased by merely 4.2% and 15.5%, respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to Article 2 of the Fourth FYDP Law, and to establish fiscal and budgetary discipline during the course of the FYDP, the following measures were taken:</p>
<p>1 The government was obliged to increase the share of expenses financed through government non-oil revenues in a way that by the end of the plan government expenses could be financed entirely through tax and other non-oil revenues.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 2, during the Fourth FYDP years, the share of expenses in non-oil resources constantly increased, except for the year 1387 (2008/09), with the highest share related to 1388 (2009/10) (the last year of the FYDP) by 76.3% and the lowest to 1384 (2005/06) (the first year of the FYDP) by 51.7%.</p>
<p>2 Based on Paragraph (b), Article 2, Fourth FYDP Law, financing the budget deficit through borrowing from the Central Bank and the banking system is prohibited. During the implementation years of the Fourth FYDP Law, there was no borrowing from the Central Bank or the banking system (for financing budget deficit). Moreover, during the course of the Fourth FYDP, measures were taken to privatize state-owned companies. Table 3 summarizes the performance of the Iranian Privatization Organization (IPO) during 1384-88 (2005/06-2009/10).</p>
<p>The receipts of the Treasury General of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance from privatizing state-owned companies were respectively IR1,786.6 billion, IR818,6 billion, IR32,956.9 billion, IR10,959.3 billion, and IR62,936.2 billion during 1384-88 (2005/06-2009/10), with the highest amount related to 1388 (2009/10).</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bank Mellat was one of the leaders in the privatization of the Iranian banking sector. What sets Bank Mellat apart from its rivals in the banking industry?</h4><p>The bank was marked out for privatization according to Act 44 of the Constitution, and in fact it was the first Iranian bank to be privatized in early 2008. The management of the bank, especially my colleagues, played a very important role in the privatization of Iran's banking sector. After Bank Mellat was privatized, other banks joined Act 44, and now the share of the private banking industry is more than 50% of the system. At present, more than 80% of Bank Mellat shares are in the hands of the private sector, and for the past two years the directorship of the bank has been outside of government control. The shareholders now have control over the bank and four out of the five seats on the Board of Directors are in the hands of the private sector. One seat, amounting to a 20% share, remains in the hands of the government, though within a very short time this stake will also be sold off, making the bank fully privatized. For the last two years, the bank has been managed under a new charter based on the rules and regulations of the private sector. Bank Mellat has become the largest private bank in the country because of its financial position and in terms of the capital resources it holds. After increasing its general capital, which happened this year after the General Assembly meeting, the total capital of the bank now amounts to something around $1.6 billion.</p><h4>What activities does Bank Mellat specialize in? In what sectors of the Iranian economy does it have the best penetration rates?</h4><p>Bank Mellat's specialty area is retail banking, and it is most active in the retail banking processes of the financial market. We have about 20 million customers, meaning that most Iranian families have some involvement with Bank Mellat. One of the main sectors that Bank Mellat is active in is that of construction and the reconstruction of underdeveloped regions of the country. This is an area of great importance to Bank Mellat and we are true experts in this field.</p><p>We have been very active in providing small-sized credits to families, for example to repair cars, move home, rent accommodation, or for other general family needs. In the retail market for micro-financing we are very well known around the country. We have also been active in many aspects related to social responsibility, such as helping villagers to rebuild their houses. And in order to protect the environment we have made available special loans to take older vehicles off the road and have them replaced with newer models. In our retail activities we have also been active in the agriculture sector, buying agricultural products for cash from farmers. The main agricultural product in Iran is wheat, and it is cultivated in nearly every village. Almost every year 12 million farmers are active in the cultivation of wheat. In Iran wheat is bought and sold by specialist traders, meaning that farmers do not have to look for customers as they sell through a system that is supervised by Bank Mellat. Some 1.5 million farmers every year deliver their wheat and receive cash immediately, and this system has been operated by Bank Mellat for the last five years.</p><p>Another specialty that the bank has become famous for is that it is active in promoting development in the more disadvantaged regions of the country, such as building schools, cultural centers, and giving financial aid to students to continue their education. Bank Mellat is a well-known institution in Iran—it is the bank of the people.</p><h4>How much of your budget do you allocate to regional development projects?</h4><p>In the coming year we are going to build more than 30 schools around the country. Another aspect of the bank's commitment to social responsibility is that we provide no-interest credit facilities to people convicted in court for crimes like driving accidents. In these kinds of cases, those convicted often do not have enough money to pay compensation to a victim's family, and so we facilitate the payment of compensation so that they can rejoin their families. In the past five years some 3,000 people were released from custody thanks to the loan facilities we provide.</p><h4>After privatization the first aim of any bank should be to maximize profits. Have you experienced any objections from your shareholders regarding these other social development activities?</h4><p>In fact, what I just explained to you has increased since privatization as social responsibility is considered a core duty of the bank. Our shareholders know that these kinds of activities help to strengthen our financial position in the market as well. In retail banking our main focus is on families with regular salaries. There are about 50 million people around the country using electronic debit cards. In retail banking Bank Mellat offers a wide range of electronic services, all of which were greatly welcomed by our customers. In the industrial sector we have been very active and have assisted many companies, such as in the automotive and cement sectors. However, our main focus is on retail banking, though we have also done a large amount of work on the investment, trade and commercial aspects of banking.</p><h4>What was the effect of privatization on your company? Has it changed the way you approach banking?</h4><p>In terms of human resources, all state regulations on employment were put aside after privatization and we are now following the policies of our human resources department regarding employment, like any private company. We have been successful in re-engineering our banking systems and increasing the quality and speed of providing services to our customers. What brought about   this change after privatization was the fact that the bank was more active in the IT sector and was able to meet all the requirements for working in this field very quickly. Before privatization we did not have an open hand to invest in the sort of telecommunication systems needed for e-banking. As for the financial aspects of our operations, we have been very successful in both reducing costs and increasing our net profit.</p><h4>Did this rationalization of the bank's activities after privatization result in branch losses?</h4><p>We reduced the number of branches, but this was not related to privatization. It started three years ago and the reason was that some branches were not economic to operate. We evaluated all of them, and as this is an ongoing process in the future some other branches may also close. Of course, with electronic banking we will need even fewer branches. In the modern world, the larger the investment you make in IT, the less you have to invest in the physical aspects of banking. Of course, we will always have physical branches because we are involved with families, and poor families do not have internet facilities. We currently have around 1,800 branches in Iran and 24,000 employees. Increasing or decreasing the number of employees will depend on the new programs and strategies of the bank. For now, we need this number of employees and use them all.</p><h4>Which sectors of the economy are you targeting for loans, and have you experienced any difficulties on your loan book?</h4><p>Apart from micro-credits and small-scale financing, an important field for us is the energy, oil, and gas sectors, such as the South Pars field and the Iran LNG Company. Some countries do not like us to be active in this sector, and there has been some negative propaganda in the global mass media related to the investments we have made for the sake of the people. They imagine that most of our activities are international, though this is not true and we have few operations outside the country. Unfortunately, their intelligence on Iran and on the banking system is wrong. For example, both the EU and the US Treasury describe Bank Mellat as being a state-run institution, which is completely incorrect. If the EU or US Treasury can make this kind of huge mistake regarding the ownership of a bank, then they are probably mistaken about other aspects of the country too.</p><h4>Do you have any special criteria that you use when assessing large-scale projects?</h4><p>The most important criterion is the profitability of the project. We take the feasibility of the project into consideration. Of course, many of these projects are huge and no single bank can fund such a deal on its own, and so we enter into syndicates with other banks to fund these projects.</p><h4>The number of Iranian banks is on the rise, and privatization is increasing the level of competition between them. What is your strategy to grow in such a competitive market?</h4><p>We are doing our best to increase the quality and quantity of the services we offer to our customers and use different tools to bring our services to them. As a result of the restrictions imposed on our international operations, we are trying to develop our internal market so that we can cover the 4% of profits that our foreign operations used to supply. We are trying to attract more customers so as to increase our level of deposits, and this will allow us to offer more facilities that are useful to people.</p><h4>You are also a university professor in the field of strategic management. How is Bank Mellat looking to improve the training of its employees?</h4><p>Let me explain about human capital and its peculiarities. In a country like ours, there is a great deal of room to make developments in the field of human capital, and we know that if development is made there will be significant change. In the world, a lot of stress is put on creating differentiation through human capital, and we also accept this. In fact, human capital is the element that brings creativity, innovation, and value creation, and can help develop an organization from within. At Bank Mellat we have a comprehensive program for the development of our human resources. There are three key dimensions to this program. The first is training, the second is empowerment, and the third is the individual development of human capital. We are working in all of these fields and are actively looking to develop the talent we have in our organization.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you list some of the major reforms undertaken by the ministry to overcome inflation and the state budget deficit?<br></h4><p>Preventing the growth of inflation and reducing the general level of prices are among the main objectives and efforts of economic decision makers. Our financial and monetary policies have been centered around directing cash flow to the manufacturing sector as well as taking regulatory monetary policies to control inflation arising from demand pressure. The consequences of these policies have been reflected in the fall of inflation in 1388 (starting March 21, 2009)—following an inflationary rise in 1387 (2008)—in which we saw inflation drop to 10.8% by the end of that year.</p><p>On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, in coordination with other relevant bodies, by taking the appropriate measures to curb inflation with an emphasis on the field of distributing goods, endeavored to minimize the impact of inflation on vulnerable and lower income groups.</p><p>In terms of budget management, predicting new sources and endeavoring to realize predicted sources, on the one hand, and enhancing productivity and the efficiency of credit allocation through improving public expenses management and the need to enhance government financial and budgetary discipline, on the other, are among the main pillars that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance has taken into account in recent years. The main actions taken have included:</p><p>1 Reducing the government's non-sovereign role: Among the executive approaches for boosting the efficiency of government expenses, the government's non-sovereign role in ministries and state-owned firms has been reduced. This is a policy that, in line with Article 44 of the Constitution, has been expedited in recent years.</p><p>2 Compiling and implementing the Economic Transformation Plan with an emphasis on managing expenses: One of the Ministry's plans to restructure the country's economy is to draw up and implement schemes concerning the seven pillars of the Economic Transformation Plan, including rectifying the subsidy system, the taxation system, the productivity system, the banking system, the customs administration, the distribution of goods and services, and the money valuating regime. The rectifying approaches of some of the above, especially in enhancing the productivity and subsidy systems, are contingent upon public sector expenses management. In that connection, targeting subsidies has emerged as the overarching pillar of the Economic Transformation Plan for implementing fundamental reforms in the country's economic infrastructure, designed and implemented for expediting the realization of the country's 20-Year Vision and rectifying different economic sectors.</p><h4>What is the current status of energy price reform?</h4><p>Energy is one of the key factors for development and a main element of production. Regarding the price of energy carriers in the domestic market, the gap between the energy consumption ratio in Iran with developed countries, inequity in the payment of state subsidies, fossil fuel limitations, the considerable annual growth in the consumption of energy carriers, the technical and economic inefficiency of energy consumption, and problems related to the environment, it is now necessary to regard optimal energy consumption as a necessity. The studies made and experience gained shows that overcoming this problem without implementing price policies will not achieve the desired results, so in order to resolve these problems, such as organizing energy carrier consumption and targeting subsidy payments, the “Plan for Targeting Subsidies" was prepared and the “Law on Targeting Subsidies" was ratified by Parliament on January 13, 2009.  Based on Article 1 of this law, the state is required to set the prices of energy sources (gas oil, fuel oil, kerosene, liquid gas, and other oil derivatives), with regard to the quality of carriers and the costs borne (including transportation, distribution, taxation, and legal duties and charges), in a way that they gradually reach at least 90% of f.o.b. prices for the Persian Gulf by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP) in 2014. Hence, with regard to the programs established by the government, energy prices shall become more reasonable in the course of the next five years. In Articles 7, 8, and 11 of the law and its implementing regulation, the necessary measures for any possible consequences have been foreseen and it is expected that minimum negative impacts will arise because of the law's enforcement.</p><p>The main advantages of amending energy prices include:</p><p>•Amending the technological structure of manufacturing units, aiming at improved energy efficiency,</p><p>•Reducing the level and ratio of energy consumption,</p><p>•Preparing appropriate grounds to attract investment in the energy production sector,</p><p>•Developing renewable energy sources,</p><p>•Mitigating the rent and smuggling of energy sources,</p><p>•Mitigating polluters and preventing the pollution of the environment,</p><p>•Improving the possibility of accurately assessing economic activities and investments, and</p><p>•Preparing the way for Iran to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p><h4>What are the root causes of unemployment in Iran, especially among the young, and what policies are being employed to mobilize Iran's human capital?</h4><p>Economic indicators from 1375 (1996) onwards show the emergence of a structural transformation in the combination of working age job seekers due to the rapid population growth experienced in the early years after the magnificent Islamic Revolution. The results of this structural change are reflected in the increased pressure on labor force supply. The average annual supply of new labor over the course of the last decade has been about two folds that of annual labor force demand. In addition to the large working age population, the growing numbers of university graduates and women entering the workforce intensified pressure on labor supply factors. On the demand side, because of a reduction in the economy's unutilized capacity and the lingering of relatively low production growth, as well as the deviation of some capital toward non-productive economic activities, we faced an imbalance in the creation of stable productive jobs.</p><p>The country now enjoys a great potential for entrepreneurship. Iran's young well-educated labor force embodies this potential, and can become a strong point if they are trained with practical complementary courses.</p><p>Generally speaking, the basic criteria for policy making in the labor market can be summarized as follows:</p><p>•Improving the investment climate for private sector entrepreneurs,</p><p>•Improving the flexibility of laws, regulations and active bodies in the labor market, and</p><p>•Enhancing the country's educational and training system to match the needs of the labor market.</p><h4>How would you describe the changing composition of the economy, the ongoing privatization efforts and their impact, and the rising role of the private sector in the economy?</h4><p>Given the role and importance of the private sector in economic development, the enhancement and strengthening of the private sector has drawn the attention of policy makers in recent years. Removing the impediments to the development of the non-governmental sector centered around four key pillars: transforming the administrative system, organizing state firms, breaking monopolies, and decentralizing the functions of the state. It should be acknowledged that the notification of the general policies of Article 44 of the Constitution and then compiling the law on implementing the aforementioned policies had crucial importance on preparing the ground to speed up the transference of the government's non-sovereign functions to the private sector. As mentioned in Article 44, the government obtained the ability to divest itself from a large number of firms. With regard to the volume of divestitures, the grand total between 1370 and 1388 (1992-2009) amounted to IR697,989 billion, IR 7,000 billion of which were made between 1383 and 1388 (2004-2009). The volume of divestiture in the said period was an outstanding record. In the same vein, a bill is being drafted that will offer huge incentives and facilities to non-governmental activities, which, in turn, may improve privatization indicators.</p><p>Concurrent with the divestitures, the other strategy of the government is to improve the business environment. In this regard and through the cooperation of the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI), some workgroups were established to enhance the ranking of Iran's Doing Business indicators. The administrative, legislative, and judicial powers intend to take practical steps to improve the business environment, and the actions taken in this regard have already improved the international ranking of the country.</p><h4>What has the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance done to promote and protect foreign investment in Iran?</h4><p>Providing financial resources and the appropriate technology for the management of macro-scale issues as well as the developmental and infrastructural sectors of the country are the main concerns of all countries, and especially of Iran. Although there are various methods for providing financial facilities, international experience shows that foreign investment is one of the best solutions suited for this purpose.</p><p>Pursuant to the importance of economic growth and development and the necessity for deeper global interaction in the post-war years, a consensus at the macro level regarding foreign investment was formed among the government and other authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the amendment of the structures and legal bases of foreign investment has captured their attention.</p><p>The execution and interpretation of the laws concerning these topics, such as the general policies of Article 44 of the Constitution, the preparation of the 20-Year Vision, as well as all rules and regulations concerning foreign investment in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA) and its Implementing Regulation, are among the key measures that have been taken.</p><p>The above-mentioned laws, in general, and the FIPPA, in particular, prepared the judicial and legal environment for foreign investment in Iran in a way that foreign investors can register 100% owned local companies and are allowed to repatriate the profits generated from their activities in the form of foreign currency or goods, following the observance of legal procedures as mentioned in their investment licenses. They also equally enjoy, according to FIPPA, all the rights, protections, and incentives granted to domestic investors. In addition, foreign investment is guaranteed against nationalization and expropriation. The other area available to foreign investors is in investing in the securities and exchange market, and some investors have already invested in the country's securities market.</p><p>Iran enjoys some unique characteristics. It borders 15 countries, enjoys an outstanding labor force that can meet the economic needs of the region with a population of 400 million, and with regard to oil, gas, and petrochemical products it is the economic hub of the region and is at the same time blessed with strong domestic demand.</p><p>In 2009, the Iran Securities and Exchange Market experienced 60% growth and saw the divestiture of large companies sold within the framework of the privatization program, which exceeded $60 billion. All of this is an obvious sign of the dynamism of Iran's economy.</p><p>Iran, as a major producer and exporter of energy, can easily meet the energy needs of active manufacturers in the domestic market. Being located on the historic north-south and east-west transit routes, it is blessed with climatic diversity as well as having the appropriate infrastructure. Few places in the world can offer all these capacities. Taking all the above into consideration, the rate of return on investments in Iran, which is the most important criteria for investment, is remarkably higher than that for other countries.</p><p>The formation of the National Development Fund will provide new opportunities for private sector economic activities and foreign investors. Since it is based on the Articles of Association of the National Development Fund, foreign investors are entitled to use the resources of the fund for their investment projects in Iran.</p><p>Taking all the above into account, Iran is able to attract large volumes of foreign investment, such that the volume of FDI in 1388 (2009) amounted to $3 billion, reflecting 86% annual growth. It is also predicted that by the end of the Fifth FYDP, foreign investment will exceed $12 billion.</p><p>Following the approval of the Law on the Admission of Foreign Banks, a chain of actions has been taken by the authorities to devolve the developmental role to players in the economy. The presence of these banks facilitates the access of economic firms to new and various resources, increasing their choices and options.</p><p>In addition, the admission of foreign banks into the country shall create a competitive environment and increase managerial capacities. It is also a positive sign for the domestic and foreign private sectors to prepare and plan their financial models with confidence regarding the availability of financial resources.</p><p>As a result of the efforts made, in recent years Iran has succeeded in joining the group of countries that have high standards of human development. With regard to human development indicators, Iran has improved, reflecting the enhancement of human development over the course of recent years. The Islamic Republic of Iran rose 18 places among the 194 countries measured, and took 70th place and for the first time it was listed among those countries possessing highly developed human resources.</p><h4>What is the status of the foreign trade regime of Iran and the reforms undertaken in this area?</h4><p>During recent years, Iran's economy experienced considerable growth in the trade sector and in non-oil exports as well as in imports, notwithstanding the global economic crisis. Considering the approach of the 20-Year Vision, Iran's economy underscores its interactions with the world as a strategic objective, with an emphasis on regionalism.</p><p>Nevertheless, since export promotion is tightly linked with trade liberalization, during recent years some widespread and outstanding measures were taken to improve foreign trade, including the removal of non-tariff barriers, concluding preferential trade agreements with countries of the region, creating free trade zones, consolidating duties, and preparing the legal grounds for the participation of foreign investors in the real and financial sector.</p><p>Facilitating trade and enhancing export trends resulted in the improved performance of non-oil exports, which exceeded the goals set. Non-oil exports in the Fourth FYDP (1384-1388) (2005-2009) were 50% higher than the objectives laid out in the program. The growth of non-oil exports, despite the global financial crisis, reflects the success of the trade policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p><p>In addition to the above, the country's great potentials, the diversity of its products and manufacturing, and the variety of its trading partners have made it possible that by changing the combination of exportable goods and trade partners and also moving from conventional trade and target markets in the West toward new markets in the East for foreign trade to remain immune of the undesirable impacts of foreign bottlenecks. During the years of the Fourth FYDP, imports into the country, under the influence of exports, rose.</p><p>With a population of more than 74 million people and growing needs, Iran is one of the biggest markets in the region and enjoys a great capacity to expand trade relations with countries in its region and around the world. Regarding the type of imports, the bulk of imported goods are intermediate and capital goods, and these make up 81% of all imports, while the contribution of intermediate goods is 66%. Hence, concerning the kind of manufactured goods in countries of the region, there are many grounds to expand trade relations.</p><p>From this view, the events that occurred in the world trade arena, despite the limitations imposed on industrialized countries, have created considerable grounds for the development of regional cooperation and investment by developing countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the latest World Investment Report, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Iran has increased from $1.5 billion in 2008 to $3 billion. How would you explain this rise, especially considering the recent global economic downturn?</h4><p>Considering that the average worldwide FDI figure was down 37% in 2009, our increase in FDI is indeed exceptional. Most developing countries did not receive any eye-catching amounts of FDI. Iran was ranked sixth worldwide for inward FDI growth in 2009, with an 86% increase in the volume of FDI compared to 2008. Nevertheless, despite this significant growth I don't think that the volume of FDI in Iran corresponds to the rate of growth, the ongoing development of the Iranian economy, or the size of the national economy. In other words, $3 billion in FDI is not really a great figure for a country of our size with a GDP of more than $380 billion that is ranked as the world's 26th largest economy. There is still plenty of room for FDI growth.</p><h4>Do you think the rise in FDI is related to Iran's newly evolving private sector?</h4><p>Until recently Iran was a state-dominated economy. We are still at the starting point in our efforts to foster the private sector, and this is where the main players in the economy have the chance to shine. We need a strong private sector that has the strength, skill, and experience to be able to bargain and cut deals with foreign investors. The bargaining power of the country now comes from the private sector. The stronger the private sector, the better it will be able to bargain and interact in the global arena. If, for example, you look at foreign investment in Turkey, you will find that the growth of the Turkish economy coincided with privatization. Now you find that those huge Turkish firms that attracted foreign investment into Turkey have turned into investor companies in other countries. Turkey's exports in services alone have reached $100 billion. A few years ago it was less than $3 billion. So in short, the more companies learn to stand on their own feet, the bigger the responsibilities and roles they will be able to undertake.</p><h4>What role has the government taken in the development of the private sector?</h4><p>When we first decided to privatize the economy we tried to find the key players and companies that could lead the way. The capacity of a country is not just its population and natural resources, but it also lies in the capacity of its business people. So as we continue to develop our private sector, I am sure we will play a more dynamic role in both the local and global economy. Our job is to provide the necessary incentives and economic stimulus to expedite the effective implementation of the privatization process and to facilitate private sector growth in Iran. We are required, for example, to give some soft, concession-like loans to the private sector. We are also required to take measures to avoid monopolization in the economy, and provide the right conditions for a competitive private sector. A “Competition Council" has been designated by the President to oversee this process. Furthermore, as per the law, the government agencies responsible for granting the licenses and permits required by the private sector are obliged to respond in written form to applicants in less than 10 days and issue the licenses and permits within one month from the date of receiving full documentation. If these time limits are violated, companies have the right to file a complaint against the state agencies involved. We at OIETAI and in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance are in charge of following up these issues. In the past, we didn't have these kinds of measures and mechanisms at all.</p><h4>Have you found yourself having to intervene to move the privatization process forward?</h4><p>Yes, we have, because state bodies and organizations have to know that from now on the private sector is the center of attention and they must adjust their activities accordingly. For example, we actually reviewed the complaints against some deputy ministers. It was very unusual that a state body would put the private sector before another state organization and take sides against them and in favor of the private sector. The deputy minister had to answer for his negligence in that instance, and we believe that these measures will help change the general mindset in Iran as the private sector continues to grow and strengthen.</p><h4>What do you think are your responsibilities and duties to the private sector?</h4><p>We need to deliver some messages to the private sector. Firstly, private sector representatives must not only know but also be sure that whatever they need—be it licenses or permits or the like—they can get it, and get it quickly. Secondly, they should know that the red tape is being cut and that the legal and bureaucratic procedures are becoming less and less time-consuming. Thirdly, they must know that we are doing all we can to reduce costs and facilitate the paper work for any company that wants to go into manufacturing or set up a production facility. In short, our responsibility is to help foster, facilitate, and provide a business environment in which the private sector can grow unhindered. Our World Bank rating has improved greatly in the last two years, and our aim is to improve on that.</p><h4>What about the issue of subsidies in Iran? How does the heavy subsidization of the economy affect the development of the private sector?</h4><p>We aim to target subsidies as this is a major issue. Our previous state-centered economy granted a lot of subsidies. In fact, the annual subsidies equal our entire revenue from oil exports every year. So there are two aims to targeting subsidies: firstly, that the subsidies should go only to those who need them the most, i.e. the deprived, the poor, and the needy; and secondly, that resources are freed up so the government can spend them only when necessary and according to its priorities.</p><p>We must also consider the huge gap between supply and demand in the Iranian economy. Our manufacturing industry is not large enough, so that once a new product is introduced into the market there arises huge demand that cannot be satisfied. That's why foreign investors can make a huge profit in Iran to an extent that is incomparable to virtually any other country in the world. There are many examples of foreign investors that have made such levels of profit in Iran that those profits have fueled and paid for their expansion on the global market. These all go into answering why there was growth in FDI in Iran when there was such a large global downturn. That's also why I believe that $3 billion in FDI is a very small amount for Iran. I think, with some small amendments, we could easily increase that FDI figure to $30 billion a year.</p><h4>Besides legal and technical support, do you have more "hands-on" operations where you and your organization can interact with foreign investors?</h4><p>Yes, in fact we've made great strides in improving our administrative support infrastructure in Iran. After all, to transform the economy, administrative reforms are just as important as economic or legal reforms. For example, we have created Foreign Investment Services Centers in Tehran and in the capital cities of all our provinces. These operate as sort of one-stop shops, and they've been a great help to investors. The aim is to support investors through an entire project, from the very idea of the project right up to its physical realization. These centers do both before-care and after-care services. They are like mini-consultation bureaus and their task is to answer and find solutions to any problems that maybe encountered by foreign investors, even after the project is up and running. We also have two websites: www.investiniran.ir and Iran Investment Opportunities at www.iio.ir, which we launched about a year ago as a bridge between foreign investors and us. On the website you can choose the sector you're interested in and find out about the detailed profiles for the investment opportunities in that sector along with everything you need to know, from legal matters right down to the application form you need to fill out, and all of it is available online. The rules, laws, and regulations are available in 12 languages. This site has been a great help for us. It's been our link to the investor community. Up until now about 6,000 projects have been brought to us, of which we have selected around 600 that are now ready to be presented to foreign investors.</p><h4>Have you been able to get the word out on the global market about the investment opportunities in Iran?</h4><p>We have been working on marketing and also on developing bilateral negotiations with different countries. We hold seminars to introduce Iranian investment opportunities in at least 12 different countries each year. The most recent seminars were held in countries such as China, Qatar, India, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Portugal, and Turkey, and they were very successful. We also held a forum in Europe, and since that forum four missions have been sent to Iran.</p><h4>Has there been sufficient investment in infrastructure projects in Iran?</h4><p>Infrastructure projects are crucial in terms of attracting and developing foreign investment. Railways, road construction, airways, metros and subways, public transport, power plants, dams, the food industry, telecommunications... all of these sectors have up until now relied solely on the state budget. FDI in these kinds of infrastructural projects has not been significant, unfortunately. This is where we want to bring FDI in. We plan on using the PPP (public-private partnership) model, which we've been promoting in various forums. We offer PPP training for relevant managers and directors, and they've responded very well. If we can undertake these infrastructural projects within the appropriate financial model, I believe we can increase foreign investment in Iran tenfold. But because domestic administrations don't have the requisite experience, the transition hasn't occurred. Until now all government executing agencies simply rely on the state budget or foreign debt financing, but we want to convert that reliance on debt to FDI in these projects so that they become more economically feasible.</p><h4>Which PPP model will you apply in Iran?</h4><p>It depends on the type of project. For example, power plants are mostly done through BOT (build-operate-transfer), or BLT (build-lease-transfer) models. Others are done through BOO (build-own-operate) models or some advanced contractual agreements. Sometimes we need to be innovative and create unique models. I'll give you an example: Imagine we have a dam construction project that requires an investment of $100 million. In the past there were two ways to do it, either by allocating a budget and paying for the project step by step, or through financing. But in the financing model, the financial institutions that finance the project make more profit than the host country. Now, however, we break that $100 million into separate parts, so that, say, $20 million comes from the private sector, $30 million may come from the government as a subordinate concession loan, $20 million could be contributed by our commercial banks, and the remaining $30 million can be contributed by local partner companies. This model frees the government of $70 million in resources—70% of the project's cost. So the government can then finance three other projects with the same money it would have needed for just one project. Also, with private involvement, efficiency and productivity increases, and the project is completed on time.</p><h4>When you receive a foreign investment application, what criteria do you consider to provide it with FIPPA (the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act) status?</h4><p>I believe the law we instituted in 2002 concerning this subject is one of the smoothest and most advanced laws in the world. According to it, foreign investors can be involved in all sectors that the Iranian private sector is involved in. Secondly, all privileges and advantages granted to the domestic private sector are also granted to foreign investors with no discrimination. A third criterion is that there is no limitation on the size of the investment and that a project can be 100% foreign-owned. Our recommendation is that foreign investors have links with the domestic private sector, but we don't insist on this. However, in the model we're going to apply, we believe there must be some kind of concession to foreign investors involved in joint ventures with local private sector firms. We haven't prepared these incentives yet, but we are working on them. We are also working on incentives that will make joint projects with local companies a more attractive option compared with 100% owned by foreign investors, the reason being that this would facilitate technology transfer into Iran.</p><p>On top of those criteria, we also ensure that the capital account is open for foreign investors so they can repatriate their profits. So, for example, if in a time of crisis the government tries to limit a company's capital account, it could not do so for foreign investors. Another criteria is that there are no limits on imports or exports. This means that once we issue a license to a foreign investor, they don't need any other licenses to be able to import or export. Additionally, any Iranian living overseas who invests in Iran can do so under the status of a foreign investor. So, as you can see, foreign investors get a very good deal in Iran, something Iranian companies complain to us about because sometimes they don't receive the same privileges.</p><h4>How about the tax system? Have you made changes there too?</h4><p>Yes, we have amended the previously complicated and ambiguous tax system. The corporate income tax is a flat rate of 25%, though in some sectors we grant further incentives and exemptions. In the manufacturing sector, for example, foreign investors have a tax exemption on 80% of their income for the first four years. So if the company's balance sheet showed that it had incurred a loss in those first four years, it is exempted from tax. For those investing in less developed areas of the country, the tax exemption goes up to 100% of corporate income. In free zones, 100% of income is exempt from tax for 20 years. The agricultural sector is permanently exempt from tax. In tourism 50% of income is tax-exempted, while in exports it is 100%. As for customs, all new imported machinery is exempt from customs duties. Raw materials are also exempt from duty, if they are to be utilized for exported products.</p><h4>Why have all these government initiatives for developing the Iranian private sector taken place in the last two years? Why 2008?</h4><p>First of all, a state-owned economy does not attract FDI. You cannot take off and fly when you are heavy. You have to lighten your load. Although there is a privatization effort in Iran, we are not moving toward a liberal economy, and there is no place for speculation here. We issue bonds, but they are Islamic bonds, or sukuk, which don't create any speculative crises because they are paid out in real assets. So although we are moving toward privatization, we are not moving in a direction that would allow for capital accumulation. For a long time there was no consensus in Iran on how the privatization of the economy could work. It took years for us to reach consensus, and it was only by 2008 that it became law. This kind of transition isn't unique to Iran; we are seeing it all around the world.</p><h4>What does the near future hold for the Iranian economy?</h4><p>Iran is a unique economy. We have a very diverse agricultural sector, with the fourth most diverse agricultural production in the world. We have one of the most advanced petroleum industries, the second-largest gas reserves, and are the fourth-largest producer of oil in the world. There are amazing historical treasures. Iran stands among the industrial powers of the region with its reserves of commodities such as zinc, cobalt, and manganese, that makes us fourth to ninth in the world for these mineral reserves. On top of that, we have one of the most educated and low-cost labor forces in the world.</p><p>You cannot find this kind of potential and wealth of both human and natural resources anywhere else in the world. So half the job is already done. We now have to accomplish the remaining half. In terms of developing foreign economic cooperation, our primary focus is on regional cooperation, even though we are open to all foreign cooperation, be it from Latin America, China, or elsewhere. But our first focus is the region we live in. If regional neighbors need access to our energy resources, then our priority is to those neighbors. Our objective overall is stability and security for the region, because that means stability and security for us as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Does Kansai Paint have any expansion plans in the near term for the Iranian market?</h4><p>The Iranian market is so big that we believe that very shortly—in the next two or three years—we will have to increase our capacity and may even have to consider building a resin plant here so as to accommodate the size of the market. For Iran, I can give you an example in the automotive industry. Iran manufactures about 1.5 million vehicles each year. Now, you may want to compare this with its neighbors. Pakistan has a population of 180 million people, and most of the cars are produced locally. You have a Honda plant, a Suzuki plant, a Toyota plant, plus other companies are coming in now. Nissan also has a plant there. In Pakistan, the maximum number of cars they have produced in a year is 150,000 units for a population of 180 million. Then you come to Iran, where you see a population of 74 million people and production of 1.5 million cars, which is 10 times that of Pakistan. It is a very big market. Pakistan is a decent sized market, but Iran is a phenomenally large market. We are ready for this opportunity. We know that there is a lot of manufacturing, and we've obviously dealt with the car industry here. And the car industry claims that the growth will continue, and very soon we will see Iran producing 2 million cars per year. That's the kind of opportunity we're talking about here.</p><h4>You have plans for growth in the Middle East. Which factors led to this strategy?</h4><p>It's about a four-year-old strategy. As you know, every multinational company wants to expand and be present in all parts of the world. Kansai had been operating via a joint-venture model in this region, and the joint venture ended four years back. That gave Kansai the opportunity to come in at full force in this area. The company started looking at opportunities, identifying which were the most critical areas where it needed to be in first. The strategy resulted in Iran being identified as the key market in this region. This is because in the entirety of Africa, all the Middle East, and right across South Asia, Iran is the biggest car manufacturer. And not many people know that.</p><h4>Do you have plans to conduct exports from here to other Persian Gulf countries?</h4><p>Yes, this is just a start up at the moment. We believe that Iran is geographically very well placed. From here we are looking to supply states in the CIS, and Iran would be the best place to start exports from. We would also like to ship to Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries from Iran, and cater to the Persian Gulf and CIS markets as well. Such will be the size of the surrounding populations that we would like to use Iran as a hub.</p><h4>What makes your company so competitive internationally?</h4><p>Well, we're number seven in the world. In car manufacturing we are very much ahead of the competition, and in Asia we're number two. Our product is the main source of our competitiveness, as its quality is unique. There is a lot of research behind our product and we constantly seek to improve its quality. Every year, the Japanese head company spends $50 million on research and development activities, bringing out new solutions and products to our clients, and improving the quality of our existing products. Another one of our strengths is in our technical services. When we provide our paints to a car manufacturer in Iran, we have a team stay at the factory full time while the application of the paint is taking place. If there is any paint that goes wrong, or anything about it that goes wrong, our team is there to immediately address the issue. It's an added advantage for the customer; they get free technical services from us. Our experts do regular testing, and all of that to ensure our quality.</p><p>When you're manufacturing a car you have automatic lines, and everything has to be done in a specific period of time. If anything goes wrong and you stop the process, the entire process gets stopped and that's a huge cost to the customer. That is where we come in and help our customers. We're not just providing them with paint. We're working with them, providing them with solutions. We have our teams there in order to make the process more efficient. And secondly, our people from Japan come on regular visits. In just one month alone in 2010, we brought over some six or seven experts in different areas from Japan. They've come in and studied the customers' production lines and advised our clients on how to make them more efficient.</p><p>Now with 1.5 million or 1.6 million cars being produced in Iran, very soon you will see that the car industry will need increased capacity. There are two ways of increasing capacity. One way is to invest more, bring in new machinery, or construct a new plant. The other way is to improve upon your existing set up so that productivity increases. If a line is producing 1,000 cars per day, by bringing in efficient measures you can have maybe 1,200 cars per day. That is again where we work with the customer in the car industry. We tell them, “These are the kinds of things that we know. If you are interested, we can work with you. We can help you bring in that technology."</p><h4>Geographical location and the domestic market were important in your decision to invest in Iran. Was human capital a factor in this decision?</h4><p>I have worked in various industries, and am often amazed by how Iranians have developed technology by themselves. I don't think the human factor is an issue here at all. I believe Iran has a very high literacy rate, and a strong higher education sector. I meet a lot of people here who have engineering backgrounds, and that makes Iran a very strong candidate for innovation, technology development, and for local capability. What we're trying to do here is bring in our new technology. We've brought in the latest technology for CED paint, and we feel that by bringing our experts from abroad over the next six months to one year, they will help train the local people, and then the local teams can carry on working in these operations.</p><h4>What is the future of the plant? What is the capacity, and how many employees do you have working in the plant?</h4><p>We have a capacity of approximately 18,000 tons. At the moment we employ close to 90 people. We're still in the start-up phase of production, but by the end of 2010 we will have doubled the workforce of the company.</p><h4>How will the performance of the Iranian plant affect your decisions to start new plants elsewhere, such as in Egypt and Morocco?</h4><p>Plants are decided upon for each country based on the dynamics of that particular market. For instance, when we decided to come to Iran and set up a plant, we had to first analyze our market potential and determine whether setting up a plant was feasible and practical. Otherwise, you could just do an import model, in which you bring in your materials from abroad. The decision to set up a plant in any country depends largely on that country's ability and market size to justify investing.</p><h4>Do you think Kansai's operations in Iran could be a showcase for other foreign investors?</h4><p>I think our message to other foreign investors would be to understand the market, and check the opportunities for yourself. Do not decide against coming here only according to hearsay. I think whoever comes here is amazed. This is an amazing country. You have to come to Iran to understand what this place is all about.</p><h4>What do you think about Iran's growing ties with other Asian economies, such as China and Japan?</h4><p>It's very strange. Some people say that Iran doesn't have good relations with many countries. But with countries other than the US, I see Iran's relations to be amazing. You keep hearing that an industry in a certain country is forming a joint venture with Iran. There is a fine line that we need to draw, and we need to accept the fact that Iran is very well placed within the international community. Most of the major countries we see either have operations in Iran, directly or indirectly, or they have the intention to work in partnership with Iran. It could be in the form of manufacturing, investment or technology. Whoever is not taking an interest in developing relations or investing in Iran is losing out. Slowly, I think the multinational companies around the world will realize that, and then they will piggyback on other companies or start to go in themselves, which I think is needed here. With globalization and international competitiveness, most companies around the world will soon realize that this is a place where they need to go next. Very soon you will see new plants being built and other multinationals coming here. And I think what the Foreign Investment Protection and Promotion Act (FIPPA) is doing is a wonderful job in supporting foreign investors. Kansai is planning further investments here and we have obtained great support from the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI). Throughout this process we were never made to believe or understand that we needed a partner here, or that someone didn't know how to work through a process. Everything was managed. OIETAI staff were very cooperative and helpful. They understood our issues and problems, which they continue to address. So it's a very healthy relationship that we have with them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The FMCG Game]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-fmcg-game]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Iran such an attractive place for Unilever?<br></h4><p>A country with a population of over 70 million, more than half of which are below the age of 30 and with ‚¬12,000 per capita in income is attractive for any FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) company. The Iranian consumer is well educated, open to innovations, and willing to pay a premium for quality. Partly due to transport and import duties, our products are sold at almost twice the price of their local equivalents in the market. Nevertheless, we have sustainable and profitable growth thanks to the quality awareness of the Iranian consumer. I travel around Iran continuously and see that our products are well placed on the shelves of retailers, even in remote and relatively small cities and towns. Iran gives us the opportunity to enjoy high levels of business growth that do not exist in the Western world anymore.</p><h4>Iran is a vast country. Are there any challenges facing your distribution network?</h4><p>Finding the right distribution model is indeed a big challenge. However, Iran offers many opportunities in this respect. Having been on the Silk Road for centuries, the Iranians are excellent traders. Between 2001 and 2007, the single distributor model did not prove to be the best one for Unilever, which was one of the reasons for the lack of growth and profitability. At the end of 2007, after spending plenty of time around the country listening to hundreds of shop owners and traders, we decided to move towards an exclusive regional distributor model. This was the most important factor in the turnaround of the business to sustainable and profitable growth. We now have mutual trust and understanding with our 28 distributors around the country, and they help deliver us high double-digit growth year after year.</p><h4>Iran is seeing a slow move from independent outlets to retail chains. What is the extent of this change and how will it affect business?</h4><p>The move is very slow. It will definitely affect our business positively, but it is likely to take much longer than in other comparable markets. The pace of growth will be nothing like we have seen in Turkey, Kazakhstan, or Azerbaijan. One reason for this is the very well-established cooperatives that are not really profit-oriented. These discourage entries into the sector. Secondly, there are small groceries with a very wide portfolio scattered around each city offering a convenient and friendly shopping alternative to the distant large chains. In any case, we have global expertise that will enable us to succeed in any trading structure, be it traditional or modern.</p><h4>Will there be a price differential for your products sold in retail chains, as smaller shops sometimes allow for higher margins?</h4><p>That is the name of the game; if you are a bigger customer you ask for more benefits. That is natural. So here also, the terms of the big chains are different from the single local shops. We visit some 40,000 of these, and this requires far more resources than if we covered a few hundred points only.</p><h4>Which income groups in Iran are your primary targets?</h4><p>The middle to upper income segments, as anything else would not be realistic because there are many low-priced local alternatives to our products that appeal to other income segments.</p><h4>What are some of the results you have obtained through consumer research?</h4><p>We do this research in many categories. People are very willing to participate and are open, so we have no problems with that. People are receptive to having us come into their homes and contribute to our research.</p><h4>How did your turnover change over the last three years, since 2008?</h4><p>From 2008 to 2010 we nearly tripled our business, growing around 2.7 times. In other words, turnover in 2010 is close to three times that of 2008. In terms of profitability, in 2008 we were operating at a loss, but this year we will report about an 8% profit before tax. Changing the way we reached our customers was the key enabler. It was like opening a clogged pipe.</p><h4>Another important part of the FMCG sector is marketing. What do you think of the marketing alternatives in Iran for brand support?</h4><p>The means of supporting your product are somewhat limited in Iran. Local television is very expensive, at least for us. So we use magazines, billboards, and buses. We also have billboards on the metro, and employ in-store advertisements. We spend considerable amounts for in-store presence like  stands, banners, and shelf buying.</p><p>The limited alternatives can create problems when launching new products that require consumer education. One such case is Domestos, where we found it difficult to convey the “hygiene platform" message without using TV.</p><h4>How would you characterize doing business in Iran?</h4><p>Iran has  a much better social and business environment than is perceived from outside. People are very friendly and hospitable. Trade is lively. Doing business in a different culture and communicating  with second languages is likely to create problems in any country, which is valid also for Iran. Communication should be clear and cover details and be mutually agreed and endorsed. You have to know the rules of the game, and the rules and laws of the country. Once confidence is installed, it lasts. That has been our experience here. Finally, you cannot name too many countries with such a population, both in terms of size and an open mind to innovations, sitting on the third largest oil reserves and second largest gas reserves in the world.</p><h4>What are the sources of your import challenges? For instance, is the bureaucracy or are high tariffs problematic?</h4><p>I think the source of the challenge is the sensitivity of the government to ensure that Iranian consumers are not exposed to low-quality or unhealthy products. We understand and respect this. However, although consistently and fairly applied, this process takes significantly longer than anywhere else in the world where we have experience.</p><h4>But once you begin importing, the obstacles you face are fewer?</h4><p>Definitely. However even if you have a slight change in formulation, you would repeat half of the process. So we have to be careful and make sure we keep our stocks high.</p><h4>Would it be easier to come here to produce?</h4><p>Overall, it is better to produce here in the country if you come close to the scale that makes it feasible. There is cheap energy and a skilled labor force. We are very much committed to Iran, and are giving all the support we can to grow in our categories. Being a local producer we are very aware that we cannot grow at the rate we want through imports alone, and so we will extend our production in the near future, within the next couple of years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Majid Al Futtaim Group and MAF PARS Hypermarkets decide to enter the Iranian market?<br></h4><p>In order to launch our activities in 2005, the first step was to gain approval from the Iranian government as a foreign company making a foreign investment and establishing 100% ownership. In 2005 the law had changed, and FIPPA (the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act) was adopted by the Iranian authorities. This law allowed foreigners to come into the country and own 100% of a foreign investment. After some talks with the municipalities, the government, the chamber of commerce, and the ministry, we decided to create Hyperstar as our brand name in Iran. At the same time, we also decided to open a store in Pakistan under the same name. By 2009, we opened our first mall in Iran, which also had a hypermarket. So, out of 15 countries in which MAF Hypermarkets are present, only two use the name Hyperstar.<br></p><h4>How was the new brand Hyperstar received in Iran?</h4><p>People know that we are affiliated with Carrefour, and we can now say that we have been very successful. At the beginning people talked about Carrefour, and now they are talking about Hyperstar—they are accepting the name. Of course, we had some issues about the name due to patent issues. We registered our name two years ago, but after that a company came to Iran and registered as Hypermarket. This company obtained the right to use Hypermarket with the root “Hyper". Therefore, we could not use our name in our stores for a while, but the problem is solved now. Even during that phase, everyone knew our store and identified it as Hyperstar.</p><h4>What are your strategic goals for Hyperstar in Iran?</h4><p>For Iran, we have four targets. The first one, of course, is foreign investment. We have an agreement with OIETAI (the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran) to invest at least $350 million in this country over the next 10 years. This entails the opening of 10 more stores. We still have five years left of this commitment. Our second target is to help the government fight inflation by introducing a third generation of commerce in Iran. I have personally worked in many countries. What we know is that when we enter a country local competitors immediately react to our prices. This means that prices eventually decrease. So, our target was to decrease the price level for consumer goods by at least 10%. We did it, and we still maintain this gap with our competitors. The reaction of our competitors was to decrease their prices, meaning we have been instrumental in fighting inflation. Our third goal was to create jobs in every project we undertake. In Iran we currently have 1,200 employees. The national unemployment rate is around 15%, which means that Iran will benefit from the jobs created by the opening of 10 new stores.  The fourth goal was to export Iranian products, since we also have an import and export license. The agreement was that while we would import products to Iran that would not compete with local producers, we would also provide opportunities to local suppliers and producers through our network to export their products. Unfortunately, this mechanism still does not function as well as it should because we face many difficulties in trying to import goods into Iran. There are too many rules and they change very frequently. However, even if we cannot import goods we try to export Iranian products through Carrefour's extensive global network. This was the deal we had with OIETAI, and we have kept our word.</p><h4>What are some characteristics of the Iranian market that attracted you?</h4><p>Firstly, there is no other country of this size in the Middle East. The population of Iran is more than 70 million. Secondly, you can say it is a very stable country, even if there are some issues. Thirdly, we were attracted by Iran's GDP. Iran has the third highest GDP in the region after Saudi Arabia and the UAE. But if you compare the GDP per capita across these countries, you will see it is much more balanced in Iran than in Saudi Arabia. Iran has a very young population—more than 60% are under 30 years of age. We feel that this country has a good future. We foresee our projects having a life of at least 20 or 30 years, which means that we want to be here for the long term.</p><p>Also, Iranian culture is closer to the cultures of the other countries in which we are active, which means it is easier for us to develop our business. Our store has been very much welcomed, and on average we have 15,000 customers per day, while during peak times we reach 100,000 visitors. In addition, we have attracted other foreign investors, companies like Mango and Esprit. Originally, they were hesitant to come here for many reasons, but we have been successful with our business and we are well known around the world. We became a reference point for other foreign companies. Now many foreign companies come and meet with us, even before having a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p><h4>What are the challenges these foreign companies have to face?</h4><p>The main issue is bureaucracy. There are many, long procedures that a foreign investor has to undergo. But once you go through them the first time, you are much more prepared. Of course, after that we have local competitors. Small retailers are not a big issue because around the world there are small retailers we have to compete with. The more important competitors are the chain cooperatives that belong to the state, the municipality and the army, like Refah and Sepah. As they are non-profit cooperatives and have subsidized prices their competition is more important than that of small retailers. We compete against each other in terms of prices, which is beneficial for customers and was also one of our goals. Many of them became more professional and got used to the idea of providing everything for the customer under one roof. Thus, the competitive environment we created was instrumental in them improving their services.</p><h4>How do you decide on a location when opening a store?</h4><p>We position ourselves as a service provider for the middle class. On average we can say we target the B minus socio-economic group, which is the middle class. But of course our concern at the beginning was how we can reach the Iranians in these strata. The cost of real estate in Iran is very high, as people use real estate as an investment tool due to the lack of other financial instruments, though as the financial markets deepen the cost of real estate will decrease. As we do not want to buy property, the first thing to do was to convince people to lease us land. Cheap real estate helps us discount our product and, naturally, we cannot afford to be in an expensive country. Therefore, at the moment the construction of many shopping centers and malls has stopped in Iran. How can we pay $30,000 per square meter (sqm)? For this reason, we cannot be in the richest area in Tehran, so we looked at other areas. We are always looking for a piece of land between 20,000 and 30,000 sqm. Unfortunately, you cannot find real estate of this size in Iran with only one landlord. The land on which our Tehran store currently resides is 25,000 sqm in size and had 80 owners. Many of them did not have any written documentation that proved their ownership. Government offices may have the knowledge about the properties, but it is not so easy to access the information in them. Another related problem was that we did not know how the area was zoned by the local and central government. After some time we obtained this data, allowing us to at least start our work. There are very few places with commercial zoning and this makes the prices even higher.</p><h4>Does OIETAI help you with these issues?</h4><p>They have always helped, and this is good. The change in the zoning of the land took more than a year and a half. After that, you have to get a building permit from the municipality, which also takes time. Once this was done, we had to convince the Ministry of Health to give us the right to sell fresh food along with textiles. They asked us to erect a wall between them, which is not our concept. We just explained and invited them to see how it works in Dubai, since we have a store there. We also launched a project with HCS, which is a Swiss company, in order to reach the highest standard of hygiene in the world. This was difficult, but we did it. After that, it took time to convince people that we wanted to transform the products in our bakery, pastry, butchery and fish sections by ourselves. They initially did not allow us to do that, and thought we should build a factory to provide such in-store services. It took more than eight months to get approval for the various sections, but the authorities are very content now.</p><p>Our store has become a place to train people, and even our competitors ask to be able to come to our store to train their own employees. Of course we cannot allow that, but they are welcome to visit our store.</p><h4>In which cities do you want to open stores, and do you think you will face the same problems when establishing these new outlets?</h4><p>No, not at all, because our store is well known now and it will serve as a model. In 2011, in the first two quarters, we will open stores in Esfahan, Shiraz, and Mashhad. When we entered into existing buildings in Esfahan and Shiraz, we did not face the difficulties we confronted in Tehran. In Shiraz we will have a Hyperstar, 2,000 shops, an attraction park, and a large 5-star hotel. This is even better than Tehran, because in Tehran land prices have skyrocketed. In Esfahan, we are going to have a 10,000 sqm hypermarket. This is a big project that will attract people from at least 100 kilometers away. The next store we open I hope will be in Mashhad, and it will be twice the size of the Tehran store.</p><h4>What about the suppliers? Are they used to working with markets and stores of this size?</h4><p>They understand the business very well, meaning that we have to buy and they have to sell. Of course, if you can find some compromise with them then it's not a big issue. Ideally, we would like to go directly to the factory, but it's not always possible. We have a very good relationship with the Chamber of Commerce. I am the vice-president of the French-Iranian Chamber of Commerce, so I am in touch with many suppliers, and we have had several meetings with them. They understood very well and travel extensively, so they knew the hypermarket concept they had seen abroad. We make a 1-year agreement with them to sell their products in our store. What we do with suppliers is work with them to improve the logistics of delivery. Now we have an automated process. They receive our orders and deliver what we need in a day's time. Another poignant issue is that we pay on time.</p><h4>Are you happy with their level of service and delivery?</h4><p>Yes, it's amazing. Compared to other countries this is the best, but it took time. We have several rounds of discussion with each of them and they have improved their logistics greatly. With some of them, we want to develop our own brand. That means we are going to work on packaging, how to save money, and so on. Through that, we'll export their products through our network. We will work on private labeling. It's difficult to have a business in Iran because, first of all, we have to understand that we are not Iranian. I didn't come to Iran to change things at all. Yes, I came to Iran to do business and change—a little bit—the way of doing business. But I don't want to change Iranians. They will change their mind if they like what we are doing. But it took time for us, at the beginning, to understand how this works, and it can take years to determine whether we can improve it or not.</p><h4>How do you regard consumer behavior in Iran?</h4><p>They are really focused on quality, and this pushes us to do our best. When we tried to sell fish in Tehran, people refused; they said that the fish was not fresh. So, we launched a special program to buy our fish from southern Iran. We contracted with Iran Air. Every night fish is coming in coolers and is in the store the next day. Among the 15 countries where we have stores in the Middle East, we have the highest sales of fish in Iran. It is surprising to see the number of people queuing to get fish because it is very fresh. Before we organized this, there was no way for them to get it, so the result was immediate. At first, I was surprised by the behavior of customers because they are very demanding, which means they are well educated. They know our business very well and they push us a lot to improve what we are doing. As a result, we are doing some things here that we aren't doing in other countries. For example, they wanted benches installed, so we did that along with a water fountain and so on. Furthermore, for appliance sales, we also deliver for free. If you buy a refrigerator here in a small shop, they deliver it the same day.</p><h4>Do you only have this policy in Iran?</h4><p>We do it in some countries, but in Iran it was our target to improve, and it was a demand of the customers. So currently, we deliver and install for free and we even call people after the delivery service to find out how it went. The awareness level of the customers in Iran impresses me. They are very educated and demanding. They want the best in terms of quality, price, freshness, and the like. This morning I was in the store and one customer stopped me and she said, “You have to do something for the cashiers. They work too much and they are tired." Her advice, in this situation, was to change the rotation of the people and to have more cashiers do the work. As you can see, our customers are very involved in our business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the stable and dynamic aspects of the Islamic Republic of Iran's place in the fast-changing political and economic order of the world?</h4><p>Everyone knows that the land of Iran is the birthplace of a great civilization, having a historical background of over 7,000 years and being a civilization based on humane and divine values. Monotheism, respect for the rights of nations, and a rejection of the slavery and bondage of mankind are among the key features of Iranian civilization. After the coming of Islam, Iran's civilization, on the basis of Islamic culture and education, grew faster and experienced further expansion, achieving great ratings in the fields of monotheism and the belief in one God, literature and the arts, logic and philosophy, science and technology, mathematics and astrology, medicine, physics, chemistry, ethics, and human sciences, and it has introduced great scientists and provided many services to humanity as a whole.</p><p>During recent centuries, and especially over the course of the last century due to the consequences of aggression, war making, violations, and the avarice of oppressors, the forward movement of our nation encountered obstacles and hurdles. However, the cultural and intellectual foundation of our nation, through the endeavor and hard work of its wise and compassionate people, remained immune, leading the Iranian nation to the year 1357 (1978). In that year, under the leadership of Imam Khomeini, the monotheist, brave, wise man that lived a simple life and served the people, the Islamic Revolution in Iran began. The dictatorship, which through the support of the colonial powers, was overwhelming Iran, was toppled, and independence, freedom, and a governing system based on the votes of the people and the principles of Islam was established in our country.</p><p>Despite confronting international avarice, the eight-year Imposed War, threats, and unlawful sanctions, the Iranian nation proudly flies the flag of dignity, independence, and progress, and has bravely resisted all aggressions and disagreements and is removing all barriers in its way.</p><p>The nation of Iran looks for peace, justice, dignity, and advancement for all nations. It respects all human beings and propagates love, affection, and friendship.</p><p>Fortunately, the Islamic Republic of Iran has friendly and brotherly relations with all the nations and governments of the world, always insisting on the enhancement of relations based on justice, mutual respect, friendliness, and brotherhood, while standing firm against international avarice and expansionism and confronting aggression, occupation, and those who choose to deny the rights of nations.</p><p>Today, the nations of the world, and a majority of their governments, support the fair, just, and humanitarian stances of the Islamic Republic of Iran and see themselves on the side of the Iranian nation. This context is an advantageous opportunity to pave the way for the development and advancement of all nations through cooperation and concerted action.</p><h4>Could you explain Iran's growing ties with the economies of Asia and the Pacific and the importance of these increasingly privileged relationships for the Iranian economy?</h4><p>We, as an Asian country, belong to the Asian civilization, which is the root of human civilization. Our destinies are interlocked. The development of each of us means the development of the others, and if any harm comes to any of us, the others suffer as well. There are numerous reasons why Asian countries should stay together. None of us are expansionist, avaricious, or greedy. Our cultures share values such as humanity, love, affection, justice, and brotherhood. All of us confront insecurity, war, and terrorism. Over the course of recent years, it was made clear that the international economic system is not based on justice, and revolves around the benefits that some certain capitalistic countries derive. It is not only incapable of serving the economic interests of the nations, but also causes the spilling over of crises from high-risk countries and their shaky capitalistic systems to our countries. This bitter and costly experience proves that we should depend on ourselves and look to each other more than before.</p><p>Mutual, multilateral, and regional cooperation may play a key role in dynamic economic growth, bringing security and stability to countries.</p><p>For the time being, the Islamic Republic of Iran's relations with the countries of Central Asia, our neighbors, and those countries located in east and southeast Asia as well as plenty of other Asian countries, bilaterally, multilaterally, or through organizations such as ECO and COMCEC, are strong, and developing. Trade, technology transfer, the financing of industrial, agricultural, and energy projects, the implementation of joint touristic projects and so on are among the economic benefits that these relations deliver to us.</p><h4>What has been the impact of changing political relations with the EU—a key trading partner—on EU-Iran economic relations?</h4><p>Iran's foreign policy is based on the principles of justice, friendship, mutual respect, and the maintenance of human dignity. The relations of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the governments who apply these principles shall be robust and good. The experience of the recent decades shows that, unfortunately, some European governments, under the influence of the international oppressors, with the Zionist regime at the top of them, are not allowed to establish fair and friendly relations.</p><p>Of course, the unfair behavior of some Europeans shall be to the detriment of themselves. They think the world is limited to Europe. The world is much bigger than the mentality and ideas of some. Although the market share of European companies in Iran has increased in the current year, in comparison to the rapid growth of Iran's foreign trade, it is declining and Asian countries are quickly replacing them. Europe's share in Iran's oil exports remains fixed, while in the non-oil sector Asian countries, especially our neighbors, have surpassed countries such as Germany and Italy. In the imports sector, the UAE, China, and South Korea have enhanced their ranking when compared to Europe in their levels of foreign trade with Iran.</p><p>At present, many American and European companies struggle to get around the obstacles and sanctions to work with the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the performance of the Iranian economy under your direction, the domestic and international factors influencing this performance, and your assessment of the path ahead?</h4><p>To improve the efficiency of the Iranian economy, there are transformations and reforms underway in seven fields within the framework of the General Policies of the System and the Twenty-Year Vision. The consequences of such transformations include the establishment of more justice in the distribution of resources; the growth of talents and capabilities; further price transparency; the greater participation of the people and private sector, whether domestic or foreign, in the economy; the prevention of resource waste; a smaller bureaucracy; and enhancing competitiveness and the like.</p><p>The reforms underway include those of the tax system, the improvement of the banking system, goods distribution channels, the customs system, the national currency value, the subsidy system, and productivity.</p><p>The first step in targeting subsidies was successfully taken and the management and strength of the Iranian nation was well demonstrated during this great effort. Our experience in targeting subsidies is an outstanding achievement that can be an example to other countries. This act was conducted while Iran was under the heaviest of international sanctions. This matter is proof that the impact of sanctions on Iran's economy is trifling. The second is that Iran's system has the highest level of stability and strength, and enjoys the support of the people as it continues its advancement and progress.</p><h4>How do you see Vision 2025 and other related policies creating a more efficient Iranian economy?</h4><p>Through diversification in production, transition to a global economy, privatization, and reorganization of the capital markets Iran is vastly improving its productivity.</p><p>A portion of the resources originating from making the prices of energy carriers real shall be allocated to producers in different sectors in the form of concessional loans or government grants in order to raise productivity. Market competitiveness shall become more transparent and the investments made by domestic or foreign investors in projects shall be streamlined. Today, Iran's capital markets are among the most prosperous and successful securities and exchange markets in the world. The indexes have improved dramatically and no sign of economic crisis or the crises of the world securities and exchange markets can be seen in the Iran securities and exchange markets, providing a good opportunity for foreign investors and clients to do business in this market. The securities market for oil products and petrochemicals is already active, and soon the securities and exchange mechanism for the oil market will be brought into operation.</p><p>The absence of some foreign investors resulted in $50 billion worth of gas production projects in the southern part of Iran being awarded to domestic contractors. The volume of investment in energy projects is ramping up, while in other sectors of the industry some other projects are ready to be awarded to investors and contractors. The Twenty-Year Vision Document is a milestone on the road to achieving broader horizons, and it is of course based on justice and the respect of the rights of nations in international relations. As I said before, at present international relations are to the detriment of nations, increasing poverty and widening the gap between affluent and impoverished countries. The relations of international institutions and financial organizations need to undergo fundamental changes, while institutions such as the US Federal Reserve, which empty the pockets of nations through the issuance of unregulated paper assets, need to be restricted in their actions. Regional convergence, defining new Asian shared values, making transactions through national currencies, enhancing banking and monetary relations, and eliminating the US dollar as a means of transaction could be a big help in implementing fundamental changes in the international economic system and in enhancing domestic and regional economies.</p><h4>Which sectors and areas have been most affected by international sanctions, and what measures have been taken to alleviate the impact of the sanctions regime?</h4><p>The literature of sanctions belongs 30 years in the past. The period when the Americans regarded themselves as masters of the world has passed. We have plenty of opportunities available. We advised them not to implement such sanctions, and if they continue we will create new independent relations in the world. Even now there are many nations and governments who are interested in the establishment of relations independent of the great powers, and this will happen. We maintained our high economic growth over the course of the last year, when we were under sanctions, and growth will occur this year too. These things make nations more determined, and provide new chances for the success of our nation. There is a characteristic of the Iranian nation that, if not unique then at least uncommon, and that is its ability to turn threats into opportunities. The Iranian nation takes the most severe threats and then through its civilizational and cultural mechanisms changes them into tremendous opportunities. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been under the sanctions of its enemies for the last 32 years, and the sanctions have not had any influence on the will and determination of the Iranian nation. The people of Iran reached new peaks of progress and advancement during the sanctions, conquering new peaks of knowledge. The sanctions taught the Iranian nation to rely on its own resources and capacities more than ever before, the results of which have been seen in different scientific, research, and industrial achievements. Other countries can benefit from these advances as well. Meanwhile, foreign investment has experienced impressive growth. The only impact of sanctions was on increasing solidarity and expediting our growth rate.</p><h4>How do you interpret the role of foreign investment in fostering change and increasing the performance of the Iranian economy?</h4><p>Foreign investment has played, and continues to play a key role in the country's Fourth and Fifth Five-Year Development Plans (FYDPs). Regarding the target of 8% economic growth, the role of foreign investment shall especially be taken into consideration. Based on the existing laws, the treatment of foreign investors shall be the same as for domestic investors and no discrimination will apply; their security is also guaranteed. Fortunately, the growth rate of foreign investment in Iran, when compared to other countries, is at the highest of levels.</p><h4>How is Iran moving to produce a young, forward-looking nation? What reforms do you consider necessary to develop the nation's human capital and increase the collaboration between the worlds of academia and business?</h4><p>The youth of a nation is key to the development of its innovativeness, freshness, and creativity. In addition, the middle-aged and elderly have also taken deep and unique steps. The Islamic Revolution was a result of the faith, hard work, and creativity of our youth. The same goes for our victory in the holy defense, which in the eyes of all the politicians of the world was something unachievable. Another miracle of youth is currently underway. Our nation, in order to achieve its worthy position in the world and in the scientific, technical, and cultural relations of the globe, needs the innovative, productive, and courageous presence of the youth, and this is being realized.</p><p>The government is being decisive in its support of the endeavors of the youth to foster their talent and abilities for the development of the country. The enhancement of universities and research institutes, creating appropriate opportunities in all scientific, research, and technical fields, providing easy financial resources, and encouraging innovative and creative young people are among the measures being taken. The worthy achievements of Iran in different industries, such as oil and gas, nuclear energy, aerospace, and so on is indebted to the youth of this land, and this journey will continue.</p><h4>How do you see the future of Iran as “the economic, scientific, and technological leader of Southwest Asia" as stated in the Vision 2025 development plan?</h4><p>In the vision for the year 1404 (2025), Iran, based on its culture, science, and spirituality, should stand first in the region in all economic, cultural, scientific, and political aspects. The government and nation of Iran are moving in the same direction and great scientific, industrial, and political advances are happening fast. The Islamic Republic of Iran, relying on its civilization and cultural foundations, notwithstanding the contradictions and preventive acts of arrogant exploiters, can compensate for its previously imposed backwardness very quickly. The victory of the Islamic Revolution, and the faith, resistance, insight, and purity of the Iranian nation has provided it with an exceptional opportunity. In a time that the big powers of both the East and West have reached the end of the line and global relations are at the threshold of a great transformation, the Iranian nation will continue its route of advancement, and physical and spiritual progress through its best endeavors.</p><p>The current period is a new chapter in the life of the Iranian nation. The Iranian nation has always been the standard bearer of peace, brotherhood, love, and affection, wishing prosperity, peace, security, and friendliness to all. Regarding the general move of the world towards justice, purity, love, and affection, there is the growing hope that cruelty, aggression, poverty, discrimination, and enmity will come to an end, being replaced by justice, purity, and affection all over the world, and that all peoples will be able to enjoy the rulership of righteous and divine governments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main function of the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI)?</h4><p>Nearly 20 years have passed since the establishment of EDBI. The main mission of the bank is to provide and extend a variety of facilities to finance Iranian exports. The bank has 36 branches inside the country and two representative offices, which are to turn into branches soon, so the total number will be 38. We also have some branches and representative offices abroad. The bank has been rated by international rating agencies and has achieved very good scores. In terms of Tier 1 capital we were ranked 319th and in terms of Assets Efficiency Ratio 249th among the world's top 1,000 banks as published in The Banker in 2010. Also, among the local banks in the country, on the side of capital, we are one of the top four. At the very beginning, the initial capital of the bank was financed by the local banks in Iran, and afterwards the government injected further capital into EDBI. Today, the capital has been mainly obtained through exporters and customers.</p><h4>Which independent authorities audit the bank?</h4><p>In Iran we have an independent organization called the Iran Audit Organization. It is authorized to supervise the accounts of financial institutions. There are also other independent institutions of the same nature that have been licensed by the official auditing institution in Iran. They have approved and supervised our relationships with our partners abroad.</p><h4>Which parts of the world have you helped to fund techno-engineering services from Iran?</h4><p>The projects that the bank has managed to finance are of much importance. For example, projects including electricity transmission lines, the installation of dams and power plants, the construction of houses, roads and bridges, projects for water treatment plants, public and internal transportation, industrial and agricultural investments, dairy products, and exporting a variety of health services and pharmaceuticals for both humans and animals. We finance these services and projects to Iraq, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and also in African countries like Sudan, Senegal, the Ivory Coast, Djibouti, as well as countries in Latin America.</p><h4>What percentage of what you do is trade financing, and what percentage is investment financing? What is the main focus of your activity?</h4><p>According to our financing plan we have trade finance and the issue of financing buyers and suppliers of Iranian origin commodities. But the main activity of the bank has been divided into two sections: the working capital of exporters and at the same time financing investments, while the ratio between them is 60:40.</p><h4>Do you have any difficulties in the repayment of these credits?</h4><p>Despite being a country in a risky region, because of our technical point of view as well as our risk management supervising the repayment of resources, we have not experienced many problems in regard to the repayment of resources. At this point, only one or two of the letters of guarantee have been claimed. One of the letters of guarantee in Turkmenistan was claimed, but we were very fortunate to receive the money.</p><h4>What percentage of applications for buyers' credit do you accept annually on average?</h4><p>For each country we have allocated a credit ceiling and we are going to act according to the credit ceiling of that country. Inspecting the company itself, we are going to consider its country of origin. For example, for Iraq we have a ceiling of $300 million. With this ceiling, according to the rating we've made, we will extend our credit lines. In other words, different issues should be taken into consideration. For instance, for a country such as Djibouti we have a ceiling of $20 million, and we will act according to this ceiling. If a project has been put forward and it is beyond the ceiling, we need to make further assessments. For exporting commodities and goods we do not have problems, because these are usually short-term projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the structure and responsibilities of Bimeh Markazi?</h4><p>Bimeh Markazi was established around 40 years ago. Its primary responsibility is to regulate and harmonize the Iranian insurance market. The next concerns the culture of insurance in society. From the very beginning, we have been doing insurance according to the government's policies, acting as the reinsurer and the regulator, supporting the insured and shareholders, and regulating the performance of insurance companies so as to benefit the insured. Given that our task is to support the insurance industry and the insured, part of all insurance premiums belong to Bimeh Markazi.</p><h4>How much is the proportion of legal cession?</h4><p>The legal cession requirement is 25% for non-life insurance and 50% for life insurance. There is a five-year plan that will start in 2011, which means we aim at decreasing these levels as we want to improve the level of resources that insurance companies have access to.</p><h4>What are your future goals regarding the local insurance market?</h4><p>Over the past three years, the insurance industry has undergone a reform plan based on a long-term strategy to make the industry more competitive and improve the quality of management standards. It's not only privatization, but the aim is to provide good coverage for both households and industry. At the end of the five-year plan, which will start in 2011, we aim to be the largest insurance market in the region. We are presently ranked third after Turkey and the UAE.</p><h4>The insurance penetration rate in Iran is very low. What are the cornerstones of this five-year plan? How will you increase penetration rates?</h4><p>The penetration rate in Iran is around 1.4%, and at the end of the five-year plan it will go upward to around 2%. Premiums will increase as GDP grows, though it is difficult to make the ratio increase more rapidly. However, we have a number of strategies to achieve that goal. The first strategy is to improve household insurance coverage in the fields of fire, liability and property, and to deliver this to the market at lower prices, maybe 50% below the prevailing rate in the past. It is part of a program that concerns the revision of the insurance tariffs system, which we have split up into seven steps. Up to now, three steps have been taken in the fields of fire, liability, engineering, and motor, hull, and marine cargo. Other steps concern health and third party liability (TPL). In addition, we will improve our financial supervision of the established insurance institutions to ensure the adequacy of their investments in our role as the regulatory body of the insurance industry. We also want to provide internal auditing within insurance companies through on-site supervision.</p><h4>Is education also needed to increase public awareness about the value and use of insurance? What are you doing in this regard?</h4><p>Two important tasks are being done. The first is to let society know about the potential of insurance. The other task is to professionalize the insurance market. Professional education is important in order to improve the risk management practices of insurance companies. We're also training entities such as actuaries and those involved in marketing. We need to publicize the abilities of the insurance industry through advertising and providing good services. Through these means we can increase the public trust in insurance. These two aspects together will help increase the industry's penetration rate.</p><h4>Is your focus more on individuals or on factories, industry, and corporate sector entities?</h4><p>There are two strategies that, in fact, run parallel with one another. The first is to develop the penetration rate across the country and at all levels of society with fair prices in order to improve overall nationwide insurance coverage. The second strategy is to expand the coverage for economic agencies and corporate entities.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest potential for growth in Iranian Insurance Industry?</h4><p>We think that, primarily, we have to focus on those services in which the penetration rate is between 10 and 20%. In TPL motor insurance, the penetration rate is around 46% because it is compulsory and the service is general. For other classes of insurance, the penetration rate is around 10 or 20%. For example, we are trying to increase fire insurance from 15 to 25%. According to the research we have carried out in fire insurance, just 10 to 15% of the potential of our economy and the industry is insured. This indicates there is definitely a need to increase the penetration rate for fire insurance, and our program is looking at ways to increase it to 25%.</p><p>In addition, to improve overall penetration rates, we are currently working on implementing insurance policies for municipalities. We have received several requests from municipalities to encourage companies that will specialize in issuing policies for their needs. Any municipality level insurance policy will most likely concentrate on fire, earthquake, and liability. We are also working on developing policies for the oil and gas industry, as well as expanding the accessibility of life insurance. A by-law concerning life insurance coverage is under review by the High Council of Insurance, and it is hoped that after its introduction, the penetration rate for life insurance will rise from 7 to 15%.</p><h4>What are the regulations for foreign companies looking to participate in the industry? Are they allowed to establish branches here or collaborate with local firms?</h4><p>As you know, Parliament is currently working on Iran's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan. One of the articles in that program has given foreign companies the permission to participate in the market. Based on the laws of Bimeh Markazi, there is no limitation on the presence of foreign companies. When the market expands in size, foreign companies will be interested in working here. Up to now, we have received 12 requests from new local companies to engage in general insurance, life, and non-life insurance. This shows that the insurance companies are profitable and their shareholders have high hopes of continued success.</p><h4>How many companies are currently operating in the market?</h4><p>There are 22 insurance companies on the mainland and in the Free Trade Zones. Three large state-owned companies were privatized and only one, Iran Insurance, has remained a state-owned enterprise.</p><h4>Does Iran Insurance deal with special kinds of insurance, such as for government buildings?</h4><p>Not any more. There used to be a law that gave it this unique position in the market, but it has been repealed. Iran Insurance will stay as a state-owned company, dealing with mega-projects and larger policies. It works as a supporter of the private insurance industry and tries to keep resources in the country, though it remains governmental and follows state policies. We think this is mostly for society's benefit. In addition, one of its primary goals is to support the other insurance companies in the country. There is not much competition between Iran Insurance and the other insurance companies as the areas in which they operate are different. Yet, as the national penetration rate increases and the market gets larger in the short term, Iran Insurance will lose market share to private companies. Its share was around 55%, and it has already fallen to around 47%.</p><h4>You said a foreign company could enter the Iranian insurance market. Does Iran issue licenses for foreign companies, and, if so, under what circumstances?</h4><p>The requirements to obtain a license are the same as those that Iranian insurance companies have to follow. Any company must have the necessary minimum capital based on what the government determines.</p><h4>What is the minimum capital that a company must have?</h4><p>It is $28 million for life, non-life, or for a company that aims to be a composite company. Considering reinsurance activities, they must increase that amount to $40 million. If a company has $40 million capital and comes to the market with its own specialists in reinsurance, they can only accept reinsurance from local companies, from other private insurance companies or Iran Insurance, but not from abroad.</p><h4>So they have to partner with local companies if they want to do reinsurance?</h4><p>No, they can only accept business from local insurance companies. For example, Iran Insurance issues a policy for a very large project. Iran Insurance can offer a percentage of that business to Karafarin Insurance, Sina Insurance, or any other company that has obtained permission from Bimeh Markazi. When they come to Bimeh Markazi to receive permission for local reinsurance, they must prove that they have a sufficient amount of capital. Presently, the minimum limit is $40 million.</p><h4>Is it only Bimeh Markazi Iran that is able to perform international reinsurance?</h4><p>Bimeh Markazi, the Iranian Reinsurance Company, and Amin Re have permission to engage in international reinsurance. Amin Re is a reinsurance company located in the Free Trade Zone of Kish Island, but it also has an office in Tehran. The Iranian Reinsurance Company is the first and only company doing private reinsurance that was established on the mainland. It was established in 2010 at the start of the second quarter.</p><h4>Does this mean Bimeh Markazi is losing its monopoly in the realm of international reinsurance?</h4><p>All the monopolies will be gradually removed, which is also part of the Five-Year Development Plan. In order to enhance the reinsurance capacity of the country, we will provide licenses to companies that have technical abilities for reinsurance in addition to the license they have for general policies. Also, we've tried to create a common market in the insurance industry with the help of all insurance companies.</p><h4>So many promising changes are happening. What do you think potential foreign investors need to understand about the market?</h4><p>First of all, our actions and the changes that have occurred are based on the policies we announced in our program. We are amending the by-laws that are hindering a more competitive environment, and we want society to make better use of insurance and for the shareholders in insurance companies to receive several benefits as well. As a regulatory body, we have a win-win rule, so that both society and the insurers mutually benefit. Our market is increasing substantially and we have many unknown and undiscovered markets. This is a good business environment for foreign insurance companies to participate in, even for those who just favor profits from their shareholders.</p><p>Since there are many private companies in Iran, I really expect a higher level of professional participation among foreign and Iranian insurance companies will happen, and that Bimeh Markazi as a reinsurer and regulator will play its role well in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your client portfolio is very broad. What sort of experience have you had with foreign companies?<br></h4><p>We offer our services to foreign companies that are actively working in Turkey, and to those that are looking for new investment opportunities. The reasons for strong foreign investor interest in the country are the high profit margins on offer in contrast to other parts of the world, and the presence of sectors ripe for investment. Investors have shown strong interest so far in the media, energy, and mining sectors.<br></p><p>This is also related to Turkey's geopolitical position in terms of energy and its well-known potential. Yet, there are still undiscovered underground reserves in the metallic and mineral categories. In both areas, Turkey has overwhelming potential. There has been a sharp increase in 2010-2011 thanks to regulation changes over the last decade, including free money transfer, flexibilities in work permits and property purchases, and acceptance of the international judicial system. Currently, we present our consultancy services to 70% of mining investment companies. In terms of the energy sector, we work intensely with the most active companies in Turkey. There are two nuclear energy projects under consideration, in the north and south of the country. A Russian company has proposed to support the Mersin project, in the south, whereas international meetings are continuing for the Sinop project, in the north. As a consulting agency, we are acting as a mediator in these meetings.</p><h4>Baycan Law Office is said to be the number one Turkish law firm active in the mining sector. What are the main issues that mine operators face from a legal perspective?</h4><p>Regarding foreign mining operators, there are no significant obstacles. Turkey has rather advantageous mining and investment legislation, with fair tax and royalty schemes. It should be underlined that legislation related to incentives for foreign investors is now being implemented. Mining companies are taking advantage of laws encouraging their presence in regions that already have a high density of mining and energy investments with exemptions from income, energy, and stoppage taxes. This leads to savings for companies at a noticeable level.</p><p>I strongly recommend that foreign investors collaborate with a local partner in order to cut short the long “getting to know the country" process. This practice can sometimes take up to a decade. As soon as the foreign investor starts collaborating with a local partner, that local knowledge is obtained immediately. Baycan Law Office has witnessed the fruitful results of such partnerships in the past. Partnerships are especially important in the mining sector due to its impact on people and the environment. Regardless of the company's reputation worldwide, it is impossible for an international firm to maintain close relations with the locals without local knowledge.</p><h4>What should foreign companies be aware of when setting up shop for the first time?</h4><p>When setting up a company, the most important thing a foreign investor should consider is keeping up to date with the frequently changing regulations and legal procedures. Therefore, we recommend investors work with consultancy firms. We believe that this also leads to more success in a company's future operations.</p><h4>As we see Turkey moving through a reform process, what regulation changes will we see aimed at making life easier for companies wishing to set up, and companies already established here?</h4><p>With the changes in legislation made as part of Turkey's EU candidacy bid, and agreements made to harmonize the global world, Turkey has been perceived as a secure land by foreign investors. Turkey is a country that always provides incentives to foreign investors. These incentives include investment incentive certificates, interest rate breaks, and tax exemptions. Foreign investors may also benefit from region-specific exemptions and supports. Tax exemptions are available for primary development regions, technology-oriented development regions, industry regions, free trade zones, research and development regions, and private education institutions and cultural investments.</p><p>Free zones are exempt from corporation tax, value-added taxes, and income taxes. Technology-oriented development regions are also subject to reductions on taxes for workers' payments and exempt from taxes based on software production profits. In terms of development regions, investors are supported by discounts in income stoppage and premium taxes. In addition to these, foreign investors are supported by VAT exemptions in several areas.</p><p>The current government program has taken care of tax and regulation issues. In regard to regulation issues, there have been significant changes such as equal rights, investment freedom, and international arbitration rights. There have also been many changes in the purchase of real assets; tax breaks have been provided, and the duration of bureaucratic procedures has been slashed. In this respect, the government is leading a successful process. For instance, The Investment Support and Promotion Agency of Turkey (ISPAT) was established in 2006 in order to encourage foreign investors. We also work with this agency in several areas. This agency acts as a professional mediator for foreign investors during their initial entrance to the country. We have observed the agency's success since its establishment. Its operations are executed with a private sector mentality rather than that of a public institution.</p><h4>The potential for mining projects is huge in Turkey. What measures should the government take in order to encourage more foreign players to enter the mining sector?</h4><p>Turkey has a high potential for foreign investors. I do not think that Turkey lacks any regulations regarding mining investments. We have a comprehensive legislative framework that seeks to encourage foreign investors. Because mining law is a recent concept in our country, the government has to take the initiative and destroy the prejudices in society about the mining industry. To do so, legislation on its own may not be enough. However, the transparency of foreign companies may lead to a more trusting society. When establishing this transparency, foreign companies should follow appropriate policies in human and public relations policies. In addition to this, we believe the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources should be broken up and restructured in order to enhance the promotion of investment opportunities.</p><h4>Are there any specific foreign investment success stories that you can highlight?</h4><p>There are many stories in which foreign investors have gained considerable success in investments in Turkey. No foreign company has seen losses in Turkey since the 1980s. Among the projects that I have been involved in, I can easily understand companies' success through their financials and the satisfaction of their shareholders. We oversaw a merger between a mining firm and an energy company recently, managing the whole process until it was finalized in 2009. Almost a year later, the foreign company, together with its local partner, saw its share price rise 600%. In addition, we saw their expectations regarding Turkey rise considerably. Due to the successful results born out of this partnership and others, we are seeing more attention turning toward Turkey.</p><h4>Why are so many foreign companies choosing to invest in Turkey specifically?</h4><p>Following a series of constitutional changes made in 2001, the administrative judicial organs lost their position as the sole authorities for international arbitration agreements. With this change putting an end to the sole authority of Turkish legal organs, foreign investors realized the objectiveness of the law, and as a result more investors have started to come to Turkey.</p><p>Foreign investors have also been supported by additional incentives and exemptions that can also be observed by members of the finance industry. This has led to foreign investor profit margins that are remarkable compared to world  standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges face those relocating to Turkey?<br></h4><p>The immigration process is a challenge. The Turkish government is working on making this process easier, but there are still quite a few obstacles. I think if people are investing a certain amount into a country then the government should make it easier for them to obtain work permits. We offer a service that takes the effort out of this process for our clients, and we have helped incoming companies that can be hindered by employment laws. This has allowed companies to bring in their own workforce thanks to our services and promote the long-term investment benefits of their company.</p><h4>The relocation market has seen a shift towards short-term stays in recent years. How has Bedel Mobility Solutions adapted to these changes?</h4><p>We are able to cope with people staying for one or two months as we can set them up with a business visa. This visa allows someone to take part in training, consulting and presenting, but does not let them occupy a desk in an office. Turkey is a major hub for business and our service affords businessmen and corporations incredible flexibility to conduct transient business within the boundaries of the law.</p><h4>Often the success of a relocation service is dependent on its relationships with complementary organizations. Which companies do you work closely with?</h4><p>We use a select number of real estate agents who know our expectations and our quality. We also work with many relocation management companies, and we work closely with insurance and relocation companies such as Pricoa, Prudential, Brookfield, and Cartus. We do not have any exclusivity deals with third parties, however, as we prefer to constantly review quality and price structures.</p><h4>How have memberships in international organizations benefitted your business?</h4><p>We belong to the European Relocation Council (ERC), European Relocation Association (EURA), and the British and German Chambers of Commerce. This gives us a greater connection with the relocation management companies that are directing clients to us. It gives them a greater idea of the services we provide and what it is like to relocate to Turkey. It also helps us to improve our services through feedback.</p><h4>Globalization has made relocation a necessity for many companies. What changes do you see happening in the relocation market in the future?</h4><p>One of the biggest factors affecting the industry will be Turkey's future relationship with the EU. Turkey is the Asian tiger of Europe—it is one of the major new destinations for foreign investment. We currently have prospects with some large companies yet to establish a presence in Turkey. With a market of 70 million, companies are realizing that they really need to be here. For example, Apple is still yet to establish itself here. There are also an increasing number of companies looking to open up Middle Eastern or African HQs. Turkey has the fifth largest number of billionaires of any city in the world, which just shows why so many people are looking to invest in Turkey. To fully capitalize on this we are looking at opening further offices in Konya and Samsun, as well as continue to support large international companies moving to Turkey.</p><h4>From the wealth of information your company has, what advice would you give to people looking to relocate to Turkey?</h4><p>Learning some basic Turkish is very useful; it breaks down barriers, and Turkish people are very appreciative of it. I also run an online group called the Sublime Portal that has an array of groups and societies suited to expatriates in Turkey. The site is open to expatriates and also Turkish nationals returning to Turkey. I started this online project six years ago, and we now have well over a thousand members. The site helps people get to know each other, share stories about their experiences in Turkey, and find out about the best schools and places to eat. It is also a great way for people to meet and socialize with others from different industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kanyon has garnered many awards and much international attention since its opening. What is it that distinguishes Kanyon from its many rivals in the market?</h4><p>The project started in the early 2000s, though it took a long time for the investors to decide on the core concepts. When it finally opened in 2006, it was instantly recognized as an exceptional concept for the Turkish market, with its open-air, canyon-shaped design. One of the awards the shopping mall received was from the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), naming Kanyon the shopping-mall project with the best architectural design. The architectural concept is very unique. There are other open-air malls in Turkey, but this is such a sharp architectural project. When it was designed, it was designed to make people feel like they were shopping, eating, and walking on the street. All of the shops and restaurants were picked based on this street-feeling concept. Apart from that, the aim was also to launch a lot of new brands that were coming into Turkey for the first time. The idea was to give people something new—a new architectural concept, a new living concept, and a new shopping mall concept, as well as new shops and brands. I think that attracted a lot of attention. We have worked to keep it new by continually adding new shops and projects. Kanyon recently hosted the big relaunch of Habitat in Turkey. We also developed a project with Virgin Radio Turkey to launch the first shopping mall radio station: Kanyon Virgin Radio. That brought a lot of attention, and we also built projects around it, such as school parties and fashion shows in the main area of the mall. We also have the “Kanyon box" in front of the shopping mall, which displays a new brand every month. Most of those brands are picked from among those that are not represented in Kanyon or often anywhere in Turkey, such as Emily the Strange or Paul Frank. It is a way for companies interested in Turkey to see if there is a market for them here. We have been working to keep the center fresh for customers. We also try to offer everything, including shopping, restaurants, a big sports center, a cinema, and a nightclub. Kanyon has really become a great destination since it opened.</p><h4>You mentioned the benefits of an open-air mall. What are some of the challenges?</h4><p>Istanbul does not remain warm all year round, and has a distinct winter season. If you compare it to Miami or warmer destinations, there is a challenge. The wind is also a challenge. However, wintertime does not last too long in Istanbul, and we experience spring and summer for almost nine months. In general, people like to breathe. They do not want to feel closed in. This is one reason why we have become part of office life in the region. People come here for their coffee in the morning, for food at lunchtime, and for entertainment after work. We also have a very central location in the heart of the city, very close to residential areas in between the junction of the two Bosphorus bridges.</p><h4>Kanyon is the product of a real estate investment trust (REIT), a funding model that is relatively new in Turkey but has seen recent dramatic growth. What is your expectation for the REIT industry in Turkey?</h4><p>I think REITs will continue to grow because the modernization of the big cities is continuing. There has been a lot of change in Istanbul over the last five years. A lot of new projects are being built, both commercial and residential. This is also happening in Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, and Adana—and to some extent in Antalya. There are over 70 cities in Turkey, and almost 20 cities with a population of over 1 million. This shows a big potential for investment. Also, looking at the laws and legislation that have been introduced over the past few years, the government is making it an attractive area to invest in. There are 92 shopping malls in Istanbul alone. In the next three to five years up to 50 more will open. These 50 are either under construction or in a project-planning phase.</p><h4>In terms of this rapid growth in malls, is demand keeping up with supply?</h4><p>There is an average 100 square meters of shopping mall space per 1,000 inhabitants in Istanbul, whereas European figures are closer to 300 square meters. Figures are also much lower in Ankara and Izmir, Turkey's second and third cities. That shows that there is room for growth, which is why there are so many shopping malls under construction. One thing that needs to be taken into consideration is infrastructure. If copies of existing malls are made and located in specific areas instead of being distributed across the city, then problems might be experienced. New projects should spend a lot of time in the planning phase and developers should make sure they can create value-added for the city. The investors and the relevant municipality should develop these plans, and a professional management company that has the expertise to oversee a successful venture should run the finished product. This mix is a true recipe for success when it comes to shopping mall development.</p><h4>What do you think will be the net impact of the first annual Istanbul Shopping Festival?</h4><p>The Istanbul Shopping Festival is a great project, and I have been part of it from the planning phase. Istanbul is a great city, it has nature, history, entertainment, everything. It is also a great city for shopping. You can find authenticity and modernity. We have the Grand Bazaar, which is the oldest shopping center in the world and will be celebrating its 515th anniversary in 2011. There are a lot of places in Istanbul where you can experience an authentic shopping experience—including some of the best shopping centers in the world, like Kanyon. The idea is to introduce Istanbul to tourists as more than just the Grand Bazaar—to show them that Istanbul is a prime shopping and entertainment destination. The Istanbul Shopping Festival is planned to happen annually for many years to come. It is designed to occur at the same time every year, over three major holidays: Nevruz, Easter, and Passover. It is a good time to travel, so we want to make Istanbul a hub for this holiday period. Around 1 million people travelled to Istanbul thanks to this project in 2011, and the idea is to increase this number every year by 20%. It is also a way to market Istanbul as a city in the international environment. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the municipality are giving a lot of support to this project. I think the effect eventually will be more tourists and shopping in Istanbul—both in authentic and modern shopping areas—and more revenues for tradesman and retailers.</p><h4>As a manager of one of Istanbul's iconic shopping centers, you have a unique view onto the economy. You see consumer confidence, trends, and spending habits. In this context, what is your outlook for the Turkish economy, and what does that mean for Kanyon?</h4><p>The sector is recovering well after the crisis, and consumer confidence is high in Turkey. The number of visitors to Kanyon increased by 12% in 2010, and overall shopping revenues grew over 20%. I think we will have a good year in 2011 as well, parallel to 2010. This positive momentum will continue. General economic indicators are positive. Looking at the import/export figures, Turkey's competitive advantage in many export areas is continuing. All of those positive signs give us high hopes for the coming years. We also expect investment in real estate to continue strongly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[iran-is-the-bridge-to-asia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey and Iran are the representatives of two deep-rooted and neighboring civilizations. These two countries have centuries and even millennia-long connections with each other. This connection, this friendship between the two cultures rests upon the caravans of camels through which trade was realized between Persia and Anatolia for centuries. In fact, the economic relations between our two countries are even older than the history of many countries that exist on the world map today. The common 380-kilometer-long boundary between Turkey and Iran functions as a factor that strengthens our togetherness and solidarity. Our common values in culture and civilization, ranging from Mevlana and Omar Khayyam to Fuzuli and Shahriar, do not allow the boundaries between us to act as a barrier.<br></p><p>Eras and generations have changed, unrests and turbulences have occurred, and yet none of them have interrupted the commercial and cultural interactions between Turkey and Iran.</p><p>However, the level of economic cooperation between the two countries is far from satisfactory and sufficient. Today, the volume of trade between Iran and Turkey is just $10 billion. Through our mutual visits, the two governments have set the goal of increasing this figure to $30 billion in the upcoming five years as a medium-term target. Now, it is time to realize this target, and it is time to take action. If we cannot achieve this, then there is an Iranian saying: “They sat down, they talked, and they dispersed." As the Prime Minister of Turkey, I would be disappointed if any of my Iranian friends said that about us. Therefore, my government and the Iranian government, in cooperation with our business communities, are doing everything to realize this plan.</p><p>Iran and Turkey live in a difficult geography. Both of our countries have boundaries with unstable regions such as the Caucasus, Iraq, and Afghanistan. In this difficult geography, both of our countries are symbols of peace, security, and stability. Both countries aim to foster this stability and peace in the whole region of the Near East, and improving the economic and other forms of relationship between the two countries is the best way to contribute to this process. The more interaction is realized peacefully between these two large states in the region, the more stable the whole region will become.</p><p>Our two countries hold utmost importance for each other. Both countries' geographies are strategically important, and we have to find a way to benefit from this advantage. As we are the bridge for Iran toward Europe, Iran is our bridge to Asia. Thus, the destinies of our two countries to increase ties with the rest of the world are bound together.</p><p>As the Prime Minister of Turkey, I would like to suggest to my Iranian friends that they should not be afraid of the liberalization of trade and the removal of tariffs, quotas, and other forms of trade barriers. Turkey has been through this process. Many people in Turkey were against the Customs Union with the European Economic Community when Turkey and Europe were mutually opening up their boundaries to each other in 1996. Yet, we trusted the strength of our people, and we relied on the competitive ability of our industrialists. Nowadays, in many houses of Europe, people are using televisions, washing machines, and refrigerators made in Turkey. This is a huge source of pride for Turkey. As a result of the Customs Union, both Turkey and Europe won. Turkey has gained a lot of self-confidence. There is nothing to be afraid of regarding the liberalization of trade and the removal of trade barriers.</p><p>Now, it is time to build these mechanisms of free and unhindered trade between Turkey and Iran. By putting a preferential trade agreement into practice, I am sure that we can realize the target of $30 billion in a smooth manner and both countries will benefit.</p><p>One other thing both Turkey and Iran have to accomplish to reach that target is to break the power of the bureaucratic oligarchies in both countries. They exist in Turkey and I know they exist in Iran. Yet, bureaucrats are accountable to the people. If you do not follow up on them, they will not do what they have to do. To increase the volume of trade between our countries, we have to make it easier and this is only possible through breaking the power of the bureaucratic oligarchies. I know the Iranian government will put a lot of effort into achieving that, just as we have.</p><p>The centuries of relations between our two countries, our two civilizations, and our two geographies will take a new direction, and we are very excited about that. We know there are things to do to foster this new direction, and we are very much ready to undertake them.</p><p>Exclusive to TBY based on the Prime Minister's speech at the Foreign Economic Relations Board's Turkey-Iran Business Forum, Istanbul 2010.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have allowed Ómnibus BB (OBB) to become the market leader in auto sales?</h4><p>The Ecuadorean automotive market is very competitive in every segment, and the world's major brands compete locally. Historically, a few points have set us apart from the competition. Our leadership is based on our experience; since OBB assembled its first bus in 1976—the “Blue Bird Botar"—it has revolutionized the industry. For more than 30 years, we have invested in strengthening our production capabilities for national assembly and in developing local spare parts suppliers. The last decade presented one of the most significant investments in our history with figures that approach the $100 million mark. In addition, I am really proud of the fact that Ecuador and Russia are GM's best complete knock down (CKD) plants in the world. This strategy has given us a competitive advantage in comparison with imported vehicles, as we are able to offer prime, quality products at affordable prices. The second key to our success is our commitment to customers. Every day we work to build long-term relationships based not only on words but on actions—we promote a real service culture. For us, it is very important to be part of the vehicle's life cycle, offering the best after-sales services. In Ecuador, Chevrolet has the largest service network and our clients know that no matter where they buy or drive a Chevrolet, they will find support and service facilities. Finally, we are a corporation committed to talented human resources and the community. We believe that our responsible behavior is a business priority and, of course, a part of our company's DNA. We are a company that promotes corporate responsibility programs in house with our employees and also focus on our dealer and supplier network. I am convinced every employee who works at our company believes in sustainability. Some of the most important programs we lead locally include the Designated Driver Program, which seeks to educate the population through the promotion of responsible driving in order to prevent traffic accidents caused by drunk drivers; MGC, a program through which we transfer good management practices to our parts supplier network; and “Gente Chevrolet" and “The Apprentice" Program, which are aftersales education initiatives with our dealer network and employees, which contributes to their motivation Finally, we run the “Chevrolet Siempre Conmigo" program, with several activities that reinforce our values and cultural priorities among our employees.</p><h4>Which GM models have historically been well received?</h4><p>A number of our models have become icons in the Ecuadorean market. In the 1980s, we introduced the Forsa, a very well-suited vehicle for middle-income families; and the Chevrolet LUV, which is still on the market and leads its segment. Other successful models include the Trooper and Rodeo SUVs, introduced in the 1990s, and the Corsa, in the passenger vehicle line. Over the last few years, the Aveo has also become a major trendsetter, and today, along with the LUV and Grand Vitara, they are part of the Ecuadorean car family.</p><div class="quote">“The government has been aiming to promote ecological awareness with its regulations on hybrid cars."</div><h4>What has been the history and success of the Chevrolet Sail in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are proud to be the first CKD plant in the world to assemble the Chevrolet Sail platform. Today, it is the bestselling car in Ecuador, even though it has only been in the market for two months. We were planning to sell between 800 and 1,000 units per month; we have surpassed our sales expectations by 20%. We ran a successful launch campaign that started on November 23, 2011, and within 15 days we had sold 1,500 units. To date, we have waiting lists exceeding our current supply. The key behind Sail is the three years we spent developing a product adapted to local roads and habits, and a massive marketing campaign that went beyond offering product features, to offering a lifestyle. The Sail launch demonstrates our ability to market iconic, leading products in every segment. We are present in every segment and niche; that is why our brand has achieved such success in Ecuador.</p><h4>How have Ómnibus BB's exports evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>Exports are very important for our business. Our main clients have historically been in the Andean region, Colombia, and Venezuela. In 2011 we exported approximately 10,000 units to the Colombian market, representing around $200 million. For 2012, we are planning to return to the Venezuelan market. One of our strategic objectives is to maintain a positive trade balance, so what we export to Colombia is higher than our import volume. That is the trend in which we believe.</p><h4>In which areas will the company invest its proposed $72 million budget?</h4><p>This very important investment demonstrates our commitment to Ecuador and its growth. We are convinced our investment contributions and technology will transfer value to the community. Most of the investments will be allocated to the development of new technology for our cutting-edge products. We finished the first part of the project, which involved improvements in the electrodeposition (ELPO) area, and in 2012 we will finish the construction of a new paint shop for plastic parts and a new base and clear-coat paint shop for vehicles. We are also investing in tools and equipment, new product lines, and logistical improvements. For the Chevrolet Sail alone, we have allocated $10 million for equipment.</p><h4>What is Ómnibus BB planning to launch in 2012?</h4><p>No matter the segment, company, or country, it is almost impossible to talk about the next launch. However, I can tell you that we have been investing heavily, building a very strong team, and working to develop new products. We are committed to producing innovative vehicles that will be made in Ecuador.</p><h4>Are you planning to introduce more ecological cars, such as electric cars or hybrids?</h4><p>The government has been aiming to promote ecological awareness with its regulations on hybrid cars. However, electric cars will play an important role in the future, as will the Chevrolet Volt. There are many technical requirements to put electric cars on the road, such as the appropriate infrastructure, maintenance availability, recycling programs, and the proper fuels. Today, our focus is to raise the awareness in the community and contribute our knowledge. In February, we presented Future Path 2012, which is an education program led by the Chevrolet Volt, which won numerous prizes in 2011. Although it would not be productive to introduce the Chevrolet Volt to the Ecuadorean market now, we want to highlight its features and showcase the technology, aiming to educate the population. Future Path is not a commercial initiative; it is geared toward universities, public technical centers, and academies. Our focus is to raise awareness in the community and contribute our knowledge. Our schedule of Volt exhibitions is set to begin early in 2012 and will last a year. We will use the electric cars for learning purposes so that students can dissemble, examine, and study the technology of the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GDF SUEZ has a presence in 70 countries. How important is Mexico for the company?</h4><p>It is very important. For us, Mexico is considered a part of the emerging markets, with attractive potential, and it is clearly a country where we want to consolidate and grow our position. As part of North America, Mexico offers the highest potential for growth in the energy sector compared to the US and Canada. In February 2012 the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) announced its need to increase power capacity by 37,000 MW, which means 70% growth in the next 15 years. Natural gas will compose 60% of the fuel mix used in generation. As such, ensuring natural gas availability and sufficient gas infrastructure to transport this gas will be crucial for CFE in the years to come. For GDF SUEZ Mexico this represents both a big challenge and a big opportunity to add value to the market. Our group is currently the number one independent power produced in the world. Originally, we started operations in the Mexican market offering our services in natural gas distribution. Then we expanded our business to power cogeneration and natural gas transmission. Now we want to offer integrated energy solutions to our clients, and I believe we are in a truly unique position to do so. Mexico will definitely need to invest in its energy future, developing infrastructure that enables the kind of growth a country this size requires. The tenders we secure in power and gas pipelines in the coming years will provide GDF SUEZ with work for the next 5 or 10 years. Our main strategy is to stay committed to Mexico to try to participate in all of the opportunities that the energy sector presents to us. We want to have an energy-based portfolio that reflects the standards of the group. We will reinforce our activities in gas transportation and distribution and attempt to expand our presence in power, as the opportunities available in the Mexican market are massive. We are here to take advantage of our size and dedicate large volumes of our investments to transmission projects across Mexico, which is key to the energy infrastructure of the country.</p><h4>GDF SUEZ is the leading private company in gas transmission in Mexico. To what do you attribute your success?</h4><p>The development of our activities is a reflection of the big groups' capabilities to handle people, time, money, and knowledge, and the ability to bring these factors to the market in Mexico. We are dedicated to being open to the private sector and investors. By combining GDF and SUEZ we won six bids out of 15 or 20 projects in Mexico. We wanted to balance our risk portfolio in Mexico, and consequently we invested in transmission. After the merger, we engaged in more power-directed activities. We have maintained a leading position the entire time.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico is considered a part of the emerging markets, with attractive potential."</div><h4>What role can the private and public sectors play in the development of infrastructure for natural gas distribution in Mexico?</h4><p>Today, there are two main players that could establish the framework for private investment in natural gas transmission: PEMEX and CFE. The market is not mature enough, based on the demand of industrial customers who could invest in a large-scale pipeline. In terms of return on investment, to reach a certain level you have to be patient. For the past 15 years, CFE has promoted private investment in transmission and LNG terminals. Both state-owned companies are playing a new role in promotion, and that is a good thing. At a presentation, CFE announced its intention to convert its power plants to use natural gas. All of this is based on kilometers and kilometers of new pipelines. PEMEX is also promoting a new pipe from southeast Texas to Mexico. The main players in Mexico's energy sector are involved. If there is natural gas available in the area, new industrial managers will choose areas to build new plants. We have witnessed this already in the center of Mexico, where US and Japanese automakers have switched to natural gas where we have a pipeline. Nissan built a $1.2 billion plant where energy is available, in Aguascalientes. This movement will consolidate the competitiveness that Mexico has gained against China, especially in the last three years. Add this to the low cost of production and the proximity to the US, and it means that this shift will be good for the Mexican economy.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most significant routes for SunExpress today, and do you expect to increase these routes?<br></h4><p>We started flying from Antalya to Frankfurt in 1990 after our establishment. For 21 years we have been flying routes to Frankfurt, and not just from Antalya. In the meantime, we started operations in 2006 from Izmir and in 2008 from Sabiha Gökçen airport in Istanbul. We are the first airline to run both international and domestic schedules and flights from Izmir. In November 2010 we started direct flights from various places in Anatolia and Germany, such as from Gaziantep and Trabzon, where no flights to Frankfurt had existed before. Currently we have 88 direct flights between Turkish cities to Frankfurt. Frankfurt is our top destination from Turkey. We also have a branch in Frankfurt, employing nearly 40 people. They run an after-sales operation as well as deal with corporate and agency agreements.<br></p><h4>In 2011 you are establishing SunExpress Germany. Can you tell us what the impact of this will be?</h4><p>Over the summer months we experience a tourist boom in the south of Turkey, but in winter the demand goes down. We have realized that if we wish to grow as an airline, we need to keep our aircraft in the air, even over the winter months. Our idea is to operate to Turkey in summer and then shift our capacity to other destinations from Germany in winter. By establishing a company in Germany we can fly more routes from Germany to elsewhere. We mainly carry German passengers in our operations anyway, and as such they know us. The shareholder association between Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines has been a long one, and we have been serving Germany for 21 years. In summertime, our main destinations are Antalya, Izmir, and Istanbul. However, for winter 2012 we intend to shift our focus mainly to North Africa. We expect this strategy to significantly affect our financials.</p><h4>In terms of German tourism in Turkey, how does 2011 compare to recent years, and what are your expectations?</h4><p>The first three months of 2011 have been the same as recent years, but demand is showing signs of increasing. Tour operators and early reservation statistics are telling us that 2011 will be better than 2010. We carry a significant number of German tourists, and a 2% to 3% increase for a German destination is positive. Germany is a well-established market, and there are a good number of Germans coming to Turkey in winter. If we can attract more demand for health tourism, then we will increase that number even more significantly.</p><h4>The government has a goal of attracting 50 million annual visitors to Turkey by 2023, the centenary of the Republic. What do you think Turkey needs to do, as a whole, to make that a realistic goal?</h4><p>We need to geographically diversify our tourism product. SunExpress has started direct flights to Anatolian destinations, such as Trabzon. Trabzon is home to many tourist attractions, including the Sumela Monastery, which attracts many faith tourists. We are also seeing more and more people heading to Van, Gaziantep, and Batman, which are also home to historical, religious, and natural wonders. However, the numbers travelling to these areas are not significant enough, and tourism remains focused on sun, sea, and sand in this country. If we work to attract attention to Turkey's other charms, then we will see more significant increases in the number of tourists across the board.</p><h4>Which are your most popular Anatolian routes, not including Antalya?</h4><p>Hatay is very popular. It is home to many churches and synagogues. Gaziantep and Zeugma are also popular, and are well known for their museums. Mardin is also an attractive destination, as is Tatvan, near Van. Kars and Cappadocia are also famous, and if we can effectively advertise these places internationally we can attract more tourists. The right strategy for these destinations, however, is package-tour deals, as they are small destinations and are really only big enough for a couple of days of tourism. These cities try to advertise themselves as single destinations when they really need to band together and form package-tour deals.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your fleet?</h4><p>Currently we have 25 aircraft in southwest Turkey and are expecting three more aircraft soon, meaning we will have 28 by the end of 2011. They are all Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.</p><h4>As more carriers start to look at Turkey and the market becomes more saturated, what would you say are SunExpress' competitive advantages?</h4><p>Our central focus is cost savings. We constantly strive to reduce ticket prices, while remaining competitive on the operations and technical side. There are always ways to slim our costs. Our second advantage is our knowledgeable staff, and there are people who have been working for SunExpress for 10-15 years. We have a truly multicultural company, with a staff including Germans, Italians, Belgians, Austrians, Americans, French, and British on top of the Turkish majority. In addition, it is a huge plus that we have two very good and established shareholders: Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines. We are subject to audits from the Turkish authorities, as well as Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines. Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines also support us in terms of training. Additionally, we have high-quality aircraft, and our wealth of experience—21 years in the market—makes us the oldest charter company  in Turkey.</p><h4>In terms of financials, how do you assess your performance in 2010, and what's your outlook for 2011?</h4><p>In 2010, we experienced a slight loss for the first time in 10 years, though this was because of significant investments in new routes and new aircraft. In 2010 we purchased six aircraft directly from Boeing. Previously, we had generally leased our aircraft. Over the preceding 10 years, we made a profit, and 2011 is looking good so far. The only concern is the impact of rising fuel costs. It has increased more than we expected and has risen above our budget. We therefore implemented cost-saving measurements, especially on fuel consumption. We are also working to increase our yield. There is huge potential in summer, and early reservation bookings are better than in 2010. I believe we will end 2011 in good shape.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of SunExpress?</h4><p>Currently, we have domestic and international flights from Antalya, Izmir, and Sabiha Gökçen airport in Istanbul. So of course we would like to grow. We have a five-year business plan and we hope we can achieve our targets. Our growth rate is really significant. We would like to fly to various countries within a three- or four-hour radius. As well as increasing the number of destinations, we would like to increase our frequency to current destinations. In 2011 we started flying from Izmir to Helsinki, Basel, and also started an Izmir-Erzincan route. Our plan is to increase both domestic and international routes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[building-the-air-bridge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the increase in passenger services between Doha and Turkey with the new Ankara flights improve bilateral trade between the two countries?</h4><p>Qatar and Turkey enjoy very strong economic and political relations, and over the years trade between the two countries has grown from strength to strength. The Republic of Turkey is one of the most vibrant economies in the world, similar to Qatar, and we as an airline no doubt contribute to this growing commercial exchange.</p><p>Bilateral trade between the two countries increased dramatically from $21 million in 2000 to over $1.2 billion in 2008 and the aim is to boost commercial trade even further to $10 billion by 2015. More than 25 Turkish companies have projects worth over $8.3 billion in Qatar, including interests in the New Doha International Airport, which is due to be completed in 2012.</p><h4>What is your passenger load factor on the Doha-Istanbul/Ankara routes?</h4><p>Qatar Airways started flights to Istanbul in 2004. In only seven years we have succeeded in expanding our capacity to daily flights between Istanbul and Doha and also operate two freighter services per week. In April 2010 we launched four flights a week to Ankara, our second destination in Turkey. Due to the strong demand on the route, we quickly upgraded the service to the Turkish capital to daily flights and are planning to increase the frequency even further. We currently enjoy excellent load factors on both routes.</p><h4>What portion of passengers use Doha as a hub to travel to Asia and Africa?</h4><p>Qatar Airways flies 94 aircraft to 95 destinations across six continents worldwide via its Doha hub. Located at the crossroads between East and West, North and South, Qatar Airways has established itself as a major gateway for international air transport, and in general around 80% of our passengers transit in Doha. From Turkey the majority of our passengers head to destinations we fly to across the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and the Asia Pacific.</p><h4>In your estimates, what percentage of passengers travelling between Qatar and Turkey are business travelers?</h4><p>Qatar Airways serves leisure and business travelers alike and has invested heavily in marketing to both segments. Of course, the corporate travel segment brings bigger revenues, so we place a strong emphasis on this demanding clientele, but we do not ignore our high-volume leisure traffic. Our passenger mix is drawn from individual business travelers, independent leisure travelers, groups, and conference and incentive traffic. Turkey and Qatar have excellent trade links so it comes as no surprise that the majority of our Turkish passengers who arrive in Doha are business travelers. In Qatar, many Turkish construction companies do business, and the high percentage of corporate travel reflects the strong ties between the two countries.</p><h4>How are you trying to develop Doha as a hub for international travel and freight?</h4><p>Qatar Airways Cargo has significantly ramped up its expansion in the past year with the introduction of two brand new Boeing 777 freighters, adding capacity to the airline's dedicated cargo network. Doha-based Qatar Airways Cargo provides freight services to over 95 destinations worldwide using the cargo space available on Qatar Airways' passenger aircraft fleet, as well as a dedicated network operated by its Airbus A300-600 and Boeing 777 freighter fleet. The airline's cargo operation is spread across six continents, thus providing a global reach. Qatar Airways Cargo has dedicated staff and facilities to ensure all trans-shipments are processed in an efficient and seamless manner. Trans-shipment facilities are used for products requiring special attention like perishables, high-value commodities, and live animals. Its warehouse at Doha International Airport has the capacity to handle around 400,000 tons of cargo annually.</p><p>The opening of New Doha International Airport (NDIA) will place Qatar Airways Cargo—already an efficient and reliable cargo operator—in a very strong position as a formidable regional and global cargo carrier. NDIA is scheduled to be operational from 2012. Qatar Airways Cargo's 1.3 million ton capacity facility will have one of the world's most advanced and sophisticated handling systems and will elevate Qatar Airways Cargo onto a new level.</p><h4>Is Qatar Airways expanding freighter services to Turkey?</h4><p>We currently operate two freighter flights from Turkey to Qatar each week, but would like to expand our cargo business to offer existing customers more options and convenience. Due to the high economic activity between Turkey and Qatar, there is high demand for additional cargo operations to cater for this growing segment. We recently set up a dedicated cargo team in our Istanbul office and look forward to hopefully increasing capacity at some point in the future.</p><h4>How did Qatar Airways respond to the global economic crisis and rising fuel costs?</h4><p>Qatar Airways is one of the most efficient airline operators in the industry, and we are also based in one of the most economically robust regions in the world, and so we were largely unaffected and even managed to expand during the period of the global economic crisis. While other airlines cancelled aircraft orders, shed capacity and laid off staff, we did the exact opposite. We continued to grow in line with our aggressive expansion strategy.</p><p>It was an opportunity for Qatar Airways to push its advantage in some key markets and we were also pushing for the early delivery of new aircraft. Of course, we needed to tighten our belt through this period during which the industry faced a number of challenges, including the H1N1 outbreak, a drop in international passenger traffic, and a dramatic increase in the price of fuel. Similar unforeseen circumstances have occurred in 2010 with the ash cloud crisis and the poor weather closing airports and affecting flights across Europe and the US in December.</p><p>Qatar Airways is fortunate in that it has relatively low operating costs compared with most legacy carriers. The airline's employee to aircraft ratio is well managed. We are not unionized so do not face problems of industrial action that other airlines face in other parts of the world such as Europe and North America. Also, one of the hallmarks of Qatar Airways' success has been our ability to shift capacity according to demand, meaning we are not flying empty seats when a route is underperforming, and we add capacity where possible when a route exceeds expectations.</p><h4>How do you see Istanbul developing as a hub for the region?</h4><p>Istanbul lies at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, and with its huge catchment area and economic potential, it is already an important hub for air travel. Istanbul is a great destination to fly to as it also offers huge potential from a tourism perspective. This translates into a well-balanced mix of leisure and business travelers, and we are extremely happy with that as we don't rely heavily on one particular travel segment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[leader-of-the-fleet]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In June 2010, Fleet Corp announced a strategic partnership with Fleet Synergy. What has been the impact of this partnership?</h4><p>In this business it is necessary to always work locally with local companies, as well as with multinationals. Most major fleet leasing companies try to work internationally, and fleet distribution is performed centrally. This is not only a way of reducing cost, but it is also the best way to gain information from each country in order to optimize the customer service approach. Therefore, our partnership with Fleet Synergy was natural. We are now a local business that is also a part of a multinational firm. If you are not a member of such a firm then it is possible to miss major deals—even local deals—with multinational companies.</p><h4>What is Fleet Corp's position within the Turkish market?</h4><p>We are now in fourth position. When I arrived at the company, it was in second place, and in order to reach number one I initiated a significant restructuring. We are now regaining our market share, and the target is to breach the top three by the end of 2012.</p><h4>What is driving growth within the fleet leasing market in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is an emerging market. When I arrived at the end of 2007, after already having gained much international experience, I discovered that the business model here was badly structured. We reorganized the company and pushed the market to international standards. In fact, looking at the market today, it is easy to compare the market to Spain 15 years ago. Today, the total company car market includes around 500,000-600,000 cars, excluding the public sector. This market is set to grow in the future as the economy is growing, and we expect this figure to move to 1.5 million in 10 years. Out of the total current fleet, around 120,000 of those cars are currently in operation. This means that there is a huge potential, as the market is still driven by outright purchase. It is our job as an international company to educate the market and explain to companies that it is better for their operations to lease cars than to use their money to finance their cars. This allows them to inject money into their core businesses. The pace of growth is slow, as we are still getting the basics in order and waiting for local companies to catch up. The market is definitely improving, especially compared to three years ago. Contracts are more structured now and customer management is better developed, whereas before contracts were unstructured and the sector was focused on price.</p><h4>In that context, do you see an increase in international or domestic competition?</h4><p>Turkey is already very competitive, and there are too many small, local players that we know by experience keep us from growing for financial reasons. We are not in the car business. We are a financial institution. Smaller players are simply car dealers, but that is not the right way to go about things. In that respect, there will be consolidation in the market I believe, as is normal in markets around the world. When I arrived three years ago there were more players in the sector than there are today. In 10 years we forecast four to five major international players, and a couple of strong local players.</p><h4>What challenges can you identify specific to the Turkish market in the leasing business?</h4><p>The business model was wrong, and this was, and to some extent still is, the main challenge. There are other challenges. It is very difficult to manage an all-inclusive business model due to problems in insurance, such as accidents and so on. This makes an all-inclusive business too expensive. In that regard, we have to define certain rules as to the usage of the cars in order to reduce risk over the duration of the contract.</p><h4>What is the makeup of your client base in Turkey?</h4><p>We have multinational companies as well as big local companies as clients. Now, we are starting to gain market share amongst SMEs, as this sector has traditionally not understood the benefits of leasing. The big local companies have switched to leasing to a good extent, and in the future SMEs are going to be the main source of growth.</p><h4>What level of government support have you seen for the leasing sector in Turkey?</h4><p>The government has started to support the financial industry, but as operational leasing is relatively new in Turkey it has not received the government support it needs. The market isn't regulated enough, and on top of this the government has taken some decisions on light commercial vehicles, meaning it is difficult for us to lease that kind of vehicle. This is the wrong decision as operational leasing  is beneficial for the environment as we replace our vehicles every three years, meaning our cars have the latest anti-pollution technology. Better technology also means fewer accidents, and this is also an area the government should be concerned about. We are willing to assist the government to regulate the industry, and this would benefit all parties. On the accidents side, the situation is improving. Driver safety is a part of our policy, and we advise customers on measures to reduce the chance of accidents.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish economy and what will this mean for Fleet Corp?</h4><p>Our business is linked to the growth of the economy. The more the economy grows, the more we will grow. Looking at the car market in the last three years, growth has been superb. In 2010 a record was set for new car sales in Turkey. This is going to be beneficial for us. Our plan is to continue growing profitably.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2011 Skytrax named THY the best airline in Europe. To what do you attribute this success?<br></h4><p>The most important sources of Turkish Airlines' growth and success are the development of new products and improving service quality. Nonetheless, the flight safety that Turkish Airlines provides is the most basic principal. Atatürk Airport is the hub for Turkish Airlines, just as Istanbul itself is considered a natural hub in the world due to its advantageous location. Transit passengers travelling through Istanbul have been another important factor that has allowed us to increase our company's value in recent years.<br></p><h4>In recent years you have increased your global visibility through major sports sponsorships and brand promotion ambassadors. How do you gauge the success of THY's promotional activities?</h4><p>Sports sponsorship allows us to reach a target audience in an effective and economic way. Sports personalities can reach more people than pop-star icons can reach, due to their positive images and ability to have concrete success. For example, Barcelona—one of the teams we sponsor—plays about 50 matches a year in La Liga and the Champions League. In each match the team's performance is closely watched by millions over 90 minutes, during which we have rotating advertising panels. This is obviously very visible and we are getting incredibly positive feedback. In addition, being associated with the world's most valuable players positively contributes to brand image.</p><h4>How has membership in the Star Alliance impacted THY?</h4><p>It is very positive that we are a member of an alliance with such high-quality carriers. Upon joining, we experienced an immediate increase in passengers, especially business passengers. There are three aspects to being successful in aviation: being well-priced, offering quality, and being a brand. The biggest contribution of Star Alliance was in terms of increasing our brand value.</p><h4>How do you assess the liberalization of the Turkish aviation market since 2004?</h4><p>The market in Turkey has seen incredible growth over the last 10 years. Especially between the years 2002 and 2008, the number of domestic and the international passengers increased rapidly, which is in contrast to the Turkish aviation market before 2002. The number of domestic passengers increased 25.2% between 2002 and 2008. In the same period the number of international passengers increased 8.5% in the aviation market in Turkey.</p><h4>How important are technical services and flight training services to THY's business model?</h4><p>Investing in the technical units of our company has always been an important part of our growth path. This is particularly advantageous in Turkey, where there is a strong and capable technical workforce. As seen in other examples around the world, we have transformed large functional units into independent organizations, and our technical units have been re-organized as an independent public limited company. This has allowed us to increase efficiency, keep up with sectoral developments, and provide high-quality maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services for more customer aircraft. We also provide training services through our Department of Flight Training and Standards and our Department of Training. We are strongly aware that the quality of the training and technical services that Turkish Airlines provide are very important and reflect well on our company.</p><h4>How would you rank THY's fleet compared to its competitors?</h4><p>Turkish Airlines' fleet currently contains 169 airplanes comprising five cargo planes and 164 passenger planes. Furthermore, 14 airplanes are used for educational purposes. With an average age of six years, Turkish Airlines has the youngest fleet in Europe. In accordance with our fleet regeneration and renewal plans, we are targeting 200 planes by 2012.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2011 in terms of passenger numbers?</h4><p>Turkish Airlines carried 10 million passengers in 2001. In 2010 this number became 30 million. This rapid increase reflects the strength of the company. Turkish Airlines' aim is to reach 35 million passengers in 2011.</p><h4>Turkey is aiming for 50 million tourists and $50 billion in tourism revenue by 2023, the 100th anniversary of the Republic. What steps need to be taken, by both the public and private sectors, to make this achievable?</h4><p>Turkey's tourism revenues rose above $25 billion in 2010. This increase will continue as it's expected more than 30 million tourists will arrive by the end of 2011. Considering this growth, the Turkish tourism sector should be able to achieve 50 million foreign tourists by 2023. As Turkish Airlines, we believe that the only way for the public and the private sectors to achieve this success is to provide excellent service.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the unique challenges of Turkey's urbanization trends?</h4><p>Turkey is a rapidly urbanizing country. Turkey's demographics are characterized by its population of about 73.7 million inhabitants at end-2010, with a median age of 29 years. Although the population growth rate has been abating in recent years, increasing urbanization has created housing pressure, primarily from low-income groups, and this has contributed to the establishment of slum areas in major cities. This has also put pressure on infrastructure such as water, sanitation, housing, and health care.</p><p>The provision of social housing in Turkey is a priority. Access to private funding through the banking system to buy a home remains limited due to income and savings levels that are inadequate to meet housing loan repayments.</p><p>Articles 56 and 57 of the Turkish Constitution declare that every Turkish citizen has the right to decent housing and that the state has a responsibility to help meet those needs and to promote mass-housing projects. Similar to the situation faced in almost all developing countries, making adequate shelter available and accessible to meet the housing requirements for the ever-increasing populations of urban settlements has always been, and remains a challenge for Turkey.</p><h4>What is the current urgent housing need in Turkey?</h4><p>According to data produced by TurkStat and the State Planning Organization, the urgent housing need has been estimated at approximately 2-2.5 million units.</p><h4>Which segment of public housing projects are currently the most significant to TOKİ?</h4><p>TOKİ intends to satisfy 5-10% of the urgent housing need in Turkey. In line with this target, TOKİ provided 500,000 housing units by the end of 2010. In the last eight years, TOKİ has mainly been focused on the target groups of low- and middle-income families, which are not able to own a housing unit within the existing market conditions in Turkey. TOKİ is trying to find real solutions to the country's demand for housing and urban renewal.</p><h4>How much of TOKİ's housing development is aimed specifically at the transformation of informal housing areas?</h4><p>One of TOKİ's main application areas is the “Renovation of Squatter Areas/Urban Renewal Projects in Turkey". In this context, since 2003 TOKİ has followed a comprehensive policy toward supporting modern urbanization in collaboration with local administrations. Between 2003 and 2010 a total of 500,000 housing units were constructed by TOKİ, with 60,000 of those units constructed within the context of urban renewal projects.</p><h4>On the conventional market side, which resource development projects have been most significant for funding TOKİ's social initiatives?</h4><p>Income sharing projects create crucial capital for the financing of low- and middle-income housing projects. TOKİ has developed this innovative model to fill the gap between short-term capital outlays for construction and long-term receivables from housing sales. Large income sharing projects are currently being built in metropolitan areas of Istanbul and Ankara, and these projects are significant to fund TOKİ's social initiatives.</p><h4>How significant has TOKİ been as a catalyst for the construction industry and ancillary sectors?</h4><p>As of the beginning of 2011, TOKİ undertook the construction of approximately 500,000 residential units, including social facilities and landscaping work. Further enhanced by TOKİ's role as a catalyst for the construction industry, its domestic numbers are very impressive.</p><p>Determined to make a profound difference in the lives of its citizens, in January 2003 the newly elected 58th Parliament passed the Emergency Action Plan for Housing and Urban Development.</p><p>The Administration offered 3,000 tenders during this time, providing jobs to 600 contractors and 30 sectors related to the construction industry.</p><p>Over 800,000 individuals profited directly or indirectly from involvement in TOKİ's projects. Using a process of open tenders the administration made competitive bidding a hallmark of its business practices.</p><h4>What steps has TOKİ taken to improve the availability of housing credits?</h4><p>The Mass Housing Law is the framework law defining the fundamental principles giving direction to the solution of the housing problem in Turkey. According to the tasks determined by this law, TOKİ defines the finance terms for housing projects according to the target groups' income levels and saving patterns. The sales prices are determined by taking into account the construction costs with no commercial benefit aims—namely profit.</p><p>Especially for the poor and low-income groups, no down payments or low down payments are taken and long maturities of up to 240 months are provided for beneficiaries. Additionally, in some low-income projects, monthly payments begin only after construction finishes.</p><p>Also, the sales prices of the housing units produced for poor citizens—one of the categories of TOKİ's housing program—do not include the cost of land.</p><p>These kind of financial implementations include government subventions in order to meet the needs of low-income target groups.</p><h4>What is your outlook for TOKİ's financial performance?</h4><p>TOKİ's balance sheet consists essentially of long-term receivables related to housing sales at 42% of total assets in 2009, construction in progress at 18%, and its land bank at 15%. The size of TOKİ's land bank was 110 million square meters at the beginning of 2011, and the value of this land bank was approximately TL9 billion.</p><p>Carrying out its housing mandate through a dedication to fiscal responsibility, TOKİ's long-term financial forecast is decidedly positive. Responding to the dire need for housing from Turkish citizens, TOKİ has initiated a very ambitious program, which has led to a narrowing liquidity position.</p><p>Observing TOKİ's low debt-to-asset ratio, Moody's notes that the administration is in an excellent position in terms of debt leveraging. Innovative financing and well-managed operational risk, along with the continued strong support of the Turkish government, are the major reasons behind this opinion. TOKİ will implement its large investment program without substantially increasing its level of debt leveraging.</p><p>With a Ba2 global scale rating from Moody's International Sub-Sovereign and a BB+ rating from Fitch Ratings International Public Finance, TOKİ is seen as a stable potential investment.</p><p>Moody's notes TOKİ offers a strong business model that encourages efficiency and careful management of any risk of exposure that comes its way. Fitch Ratings gives TOKİ a positive key rating based on several factors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Astay worked on the development of the Four Seasons Hotel chain in Istanbul. What opportunities did the company see for the development of five-star hotels in the city?</h4><p>We started as a real estate company in 2004 and saw a lack of luxury five-star hotels. We saw an opportunity to develop the Four Seasons brand here. The second Four Seasons Hotel in Istanbul is located on the shores of the Bosphorus and was opened in 2008. It has 170 rooms with 28 suites. The peak season for Istanbul is May and June, with another peak season being between September and the end of October. It is sometimes hard to get a room, even in winter. This means that there will be a great need for more hotels in the future. We are now working on the Four Seasons Residences, and this will be the third Four Seasons development in the city.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the real estate and construction sector in Turkey over the last few years?</h4><p>Turkey was affected the least by the global financial crisis, and recovered quickly. In 2010 the rates per square meter began increasing, and land costs have tripled in places. Istanbul has great potential in that regard. Strict measures have been taken by the government in order to avoid the development of a bubble, such as those seen in the US and Europe. Banks are giving loans more generously, and there is still big potential. We don't want to see a bubble, and further measures being taken may result in a slowdown in the sector, but this will be positive.</p><h4>Astay is currently working on the Onaltıdokuz residential project. What further potential remains in the sector for additional fully integrated residential developments?</h4><p>There is still big potential. Onaltıdokuz is located close to the Zeytinburnu district of Istanbul. This area has been designated by the government for urban development. It will become somewhat of a pilot district for the city in terms of renovation. Mixed-use projects, therefore, will be springing up in the region. Onaltıdokuz is therefore going to be the first project in that area. This campaign to develop underdeveloped regions will be a catalyst for further developments like this one.</p><h4>What potential do you see for real estate developments outside of Istanbul?</h4><p>In addition to our Four Seasons project in Bodrum, we are looking to begin four new projects in the coming years. Istanbul is the most populated city in Turkey with around 15-20% of the country's population living here. After that, beyond Istanbul, there is going to be more interest in Izmir, Ankara, and Bodrum. Many companies are trying to buy land in Bodrum, with much land already having been bought. Istanbul will remain the heart of the nation, with the city looking to become a regional financial center. So, as well as development in other parts of Turkey, there is still vast potential in Istanbul as well. Istanbul still has a lack of housing, and this means we are able to sell at a higher price, and thus our interest, as well as the interest of other developers, is focused on this city. Once this market becomes saturated, I predict that developments will move to surrounding areas such as Bursa and Edirne.</p><h4>In terms of Turkey's overall attractiveness for FDI, how successful has the real estate and construction sector been?</h4><p>At our Onaltıdokuz project, 15% of sales to date have been made to foreigners, mainly from Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, and also from the UK. This city has a promising future and we expect to see more Arab interest in Istanbul and Turkey, especially in terms of tourism, as many Middle Eastern citizens like to come here and invest in property instead of staying at a hotel. Furthermore, in addition to simple property purchase investments, the country is also attracting investment in terms of real estate and construction development. Turkey is a comfortable place to work in. It is easy to establish a company here, and it is easy to develop partnerships. ISPAT is also supporting investors well, and that organization has been positive. Astay is also revelling in this environment. We have a great reputation and good contacts. Finalizing the Four Seasons project has also given us excellent experience, and we are now on a comfortable development path, and can easily discuss and get along with investors.</p><h4>What makes Astay such a good partner for foreign companies?</h4><p>Our team members are very highly qualified. We have the ability to deliver in terms of finding the right partners and labor force. We also have a huge financial advantage and the right know-how in  that respect.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you think modern Turkish architecture fits in the modern world?<br></h4><p>Every sector of the economy develops parallel during times of growth. In the last 10-20 years we have been much more open to the world and have thus been developing quickly. You can actually not change architecture without changing society, and this radical change in society pushed architecture to change. It was almost impossible to see modern-style contemporary huge condominiums or office buildings around the city 20 years ago, but now as we have many more international companies with branch offices or headquarters—or Turkish companies that work internationally, expand, and become international companies in their own right—cultures integrate and produce sociological changes that architecture then follows.</p><h4>You have worked on some urban-design projects, what shortcomings can you identify in Turkish urban design?</h4><p>Urban design is a discipline that is very much allied to the law, because when you are working on a small scale there are certain rules to follow. Urban planning is on a very large scale, so when politics enters urban design, you cannot make any radical decisions. In Turkey, land is expensive and when you make an urban plan you must combine lots of plots together. You have to first establish a strong partnership between all the owners and then formulate the plan. But this is a collective job that does not suit Turkish investors. Most of the time, this results in failure.</p><h4>How do you see the problems with the planning permission bureaucracy being resolved?</h4><p>To get planning permission you need more than 45 official papers from different agencies. Our building codes are also very old fashioned. If you design a building according to municipal codes, it doesn't necessarily comply with separate fire protection codes or the codes of the historical preservation committee. Even if you call a good architect and ask for an expensive building, the result of the mess you get will not be ideal due to this confusion of bureaucracy.</p><h4>What do you think has been your finest work?</h4><p>An architect's finest work is always his latest. You like all of your buildings, but after a while when you design something new you have greater expectations. I am particularly pleased with the restoration of the salt depository we completed in Kasımpaşa and also the Turkcell R&amp;D building.</p><h4>What big projects have you got on the drawing board at the moment?</h4><p>We are working on a huge shopping center in Gaziantep. It is a different concept to the Pendorya shopping center that we built here in Istanbul. I was much freer for Pendorya as it was a competition, and we won. In Gaziantep we work with German clients and they have certain rules and standards, so I am less flexible. We are trying to do our best to act within these rules. We are trying to let the  people of Gaziantep know that this shopping mall reflects them and belongs to the city.</p><h4>How do you see Istanbul in 20 years?</h4><p>I love Istanbul, but I have serious doubts and concerns about the city. It still isn't as planned as it should be. Its current path is like that of a river that finds its flow according to chance. It is too dense. We need to find a solution to stop this uncontrolled growth. We must find legal methods to begin a transformation that incorporates subways and light rail. If you look at Istanbul from above, you see a lot of houses that are badly constructed and unsafe. It is a utopian idea, but if for 10 years we could allow only restoration instead of new buildings we could really give the city a face-lift.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[name-of-the-game]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company gained expertise over the years in various areas of construction?</h4><p>We gained expertise by learning from our mistakes. A lot of the buildings you see around Turkey were built by Garanti Koza, starting with the Turkish Parliament, to Bağdat Caddesi on the Asian side of Istanbul, to all the developments of the Etiler area on the European side of Istanbul. We have built more than 20,000 houses, and more than 3 million square meters of industrial plants.</p><h4>How many of the contracts you are currently winning coming from the state and private sector?</h4><p>From the early years until the 1990s our major client was the government. Since then it has been becoming less and less significant, until almost nothing. Our focus now is private developments.</p><h4>One of your current projects is the Akkoza development, aimed at turning the Esenler region of Istanbul into the new Etiler. How is this project progressing?</h4><p>It is a large mixed-use development project that will contain around 5,000 apartments, a shopping mall, schools, a hospital, a club, and all related facilities. With this integration you build value. If you build everything separately then the necessary synergy is not attained. People usually think that the value is in the land, yet it is on the development side. Out of nothing, value can be created. If Dubai hadn't happened, it would still be a piece of desert, and so the value of Dubai does not lie in the value of the sand that is there. A group of people with an idea transformed the area into a booming city. When our Akkoza project is finished, Esenler will be far better known than it is now.</p><h4>You have worked with the Design Development Group on the Akkoza and Kozaşehir projects. How has this relationship developed?</h4><p>Before we started the projects, we had to choose an architect group. We chose five or six big internationally known companies and they all made designs for us. We paid them for these designs—without paying them they will do half-hearted work. From these six we chose the design that we believed was the most beautiful and functional. We like to work closely with our architects on every stage of development. Working with the same group also allows us to develop a closer, more trusting work environment.</p><h4>Garanti Koza has completed projects ranging from dams, to high rises and multi-purpose complexes. Are there any areas where Garanti Koza is still trying to gain more expertise?</h4><p>We try to follow the market. When the Turkish government was building dams one after the other, we followed that market. Right now, no dams are being constructed. We go wherever the market takes us. Right now the market is moving more toward the private sector and the government is not tendering anything.</p><h4>What international projects and plans do you have?</h4><p>We are focusing on countries in the region, such as Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. Previously, our focus was on the Russian market, but it is saturated. There are also no big projects in Europe. We are concentrated in countries that are close to us, and that have large demand for all types of construction, and where this type of service is not well supplied. One-third of the contracts that we take on are in foreign countries.</p><h4>Construction companies were some of the first Turkish companies to go abroad. What has made them so successful?</h4><p>The key quality we brought was multi-tasking. When we went to Saudi Arabia in 1983 for a five-star hotel project, on our delegation were two or three guys. On the other side of the table was the Bechtel Corporation with maybe 25 people. This is something we have gotten used to.</p><p>I understand insurance, as well as the intricacies of concrete. I can talk with truck drivers, and also with bankers. These are the specialties of Turkish contractors that make them so successful. Turkish managers are also very sought after in the international business community. There are many Turkish CEOs all over the world. We can work under stressful conditions and are good at crisis management. We have a “never give up" attitude.</p><h4>Garanti Koza is also involved in the turnkey construction of luxury villas. What potential do you see in this sector in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is getting richer and richer, and Istanbul is getting richer and richer. As such, there is a certain demand for luxury villas. We should not over exaggerate it, as when a country gets richer everyone tries to move one step higher. People living in lower quality housing want medium quality housing, and those in medium quality housing want high quality housing, and then in a better location with a garden and the like. Everyone is moving upwards together. The top guys already own their houses. The market, therefore, is not massive. Perhaps the daughter of a family will marry and will also need a villa. It is a niche market, not a very large portion of the market.</p><h4>How can we assess the construction industry's performance during the recent economic downturn?</h4><p>We were relatively unaffected. We saw no issues in relation to financing. Profit margins were reduced slightly, but the amount of contracts we took on remained the same. Data over the last 10 years has shown the construction industry is steady in terms of profits.</p><h4>You are also involved in restoration projects. How much experience has Garanti Koza gained in this industry?</h4><p>We have gained a lot of experience in the restoration business. If you take a 1,000 year old building, and you are restoring its stone walls, you do not go there and patch it with concrete. Our experts carefully chisel the original stones out, turn them around, and put them back in. It is a meticulous task. We are currently not working on any restoration projects as there is no systematic market for such projects. When an opportunity presents itself, we are ready to provide our services.</p><h4>Another aspect of Garanti Koza is its facility management arm, how has this developed in a market that is relatively unfamiliar with the concept?</h4><p>The value of our products depends on good facility management. With bad management comes a bad atmosphere in a building. This can lower the value of a building indirectly. We started to provide such services to our completed building projects. Later, we began to provide these services to other clients too.</p><h4>How do you see Turkey developing over the next 10 years in terms of construction?</h4><p>Turkey is developing very quickly. However, there is still a lot to do. Old buildings will be torn down and built anew. Urban renewal is the name of the game. We will continue doing what we do. Istanbul is an interesting city and the differences we see compared to 10 years ago are tremendous. The visual appeal of Istanbul will continue improving. Foreigners will begin to want to live here as more and more foreign companies set up operations. This is an important signal for the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[rising-above-the-competition]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Acarlar Makine developed its range of services over the past decade?</h4><p>While I was studying in London and the US, I constantly searched for some new products to add to the Acarlar group of companies. I wanted to bring something to Turkey as a new or niche product. I thus came up with the idea of access platforms. Companies selling and renting such access platforms seemed large, and when I analyzed Turkey I noticed a lack of companies in this sector. These kinds of products are necessary in order for companies to carry out their operations quickly and safely. With the new products we have brought to Turkey we have seen good levels of profitability, mainly due to a lack of competition. This is the main reason why Acarlar Makine developed as it did—I wanted to do something as a leader. We conducted extensive research to make sure this product would be successful in the country, and we also conducted an advertising campaign through exhibitions, advertisements, interviews, and other such strategies. Now, in Turkey, when you need an access platform, you think of Acarlar. That was my dream.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your current shift from being a sales-based company to a rental company?</h4><p>At first we didn't consider renting as a business strategy, and we began selling the products. However, after further analysis of foreign markets, I decided that rental was the way to go, as this was the prevailing trend around the world. Most customers use access platforms on a project-by-project basis, and this too prompted us to transform into a rental company. The rental business is difficult in Turkey, as the idea of renting is not as common, and the prevailing attitude is that to own something is better. This made it difficult. However, what happens in the US, London, and elsewhere in the world will happen in the end in Turkey. That is another logic that we went on. We pushed ourselves and kept motivated and then decided to do more rentals. Our goal is now to perfect rental access platforms in Turkey. Right now we are 50-50 rental to sales. In the near future we think it will become 70-30, and we plan to maintain the balance at that level.</p><h4>What is your product mix?</h4><p>We have a strategy not to go outside of access platforms. Everyday I get emails from Europe from companies asking us to be their distributor of general construction products. However, we never say yes because we do not want to spend our effort on different products. We always target to do just one and do it the best. However, when you talk about access platforms it really is a wide product range. It is almost impossible to find all of the products from just one brand. As a result, I have many brands. With all of these brands, I have the complete product range. On top of that we choose the best products and give the best customer service. That is our target.</p><h4>Are there any plans to expand your network of depots?</h4><p>Yes there are. We will have a total of at least eight or nine depots in Turkey. We already had one depot in Bursa. We opened our depot in Ankara in early 2011. We now plan to open one in Izmir at the end of 2011. In 2012 there will also be one in Antalya and in Istanbul on the European side. The following three years will see more. In 2010 we saw a 70% market increase. This year it might be at least 50% more. When you look at the numbers, it is huge. It is like this because the market is very big but the product is very small in the market now. It grows so quickly because the need is very big. When you look at the product lifecycle, we are just at the beginning.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages as a company?</h4><p>First of all, we were the first. We brought this product to Turkey. The second advantage is that there is no other company solely focused on access platforms. All machinery companies are trying to push access platforms together with other products, such as forklifts and other construction equipment. Our focus is entirely on access platforms. We are dedicated to service and sales. When the customer sees that we are 100% access platforms, they are more satisfied with our service. Another advantage is that we do not have an investment problem since we are part of a big group. If we need more machines, we simply buy them.</p><h4>Outside of Turkey, what markets are you in and where do you see potential?</h4><p>We have operations in Iraq, Libya, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. We do not have offices there, but we work with Turkish construction companies that are working in those countries. This automatically puts us there. I sell products to companies that will take them to places like Iraq. We have our name on them. Local people from there call us as a result. We also provide service to these countries if they have problems with our machines.</p><h4>What is your ultimate vision for the future?</h4><p>It has always been the same from the beginning. Acarlar has to be the best provider of access platforms in Turkey. Our success also comes from our team. I have a team that really likes this business. We like our platforms and we have a common vision here for the future. They also believe that Acarlar has to be number one in Turkey. This is another reason for our success. When you compare it to the UK, the use of access platforms is about 85%. In Turkey, this number is 15%. That is why that increase is high every year. That is why our expectations for the future are very high. There are approximately 100,000 access platforms in the market in the UK. If you look at Turkey, its population, and the strength of its construction sector, it has the potential to be this high as well. When you look at the product lifecycle in the US and the UK, you see that it is in its maturity. However, in Turkey it is in its introductory and development period. It is just beginning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[home-away-from-home]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ofton İnşaat is well known for constructing upscale residences. How has the consumer appetite for this kind of development changed since the company began?</h4><p>The company was started 10 years ago by two experts from the construction sector. The company was established during a financial crisis in Turkey, yet the founders were brave and trusted their experience. In terms of construction, Turkey is a fast-developing country, and there is still a big need for high-end residences and skyscrapers. Ofton is wise in its choice and development of land, and its major projects are always in the heart of the city, in places such as Taksim, or Bomonti, which Ofton really drove the development of as a top-class residential area. Ofton's main residential brand, Elysium, is hugely popular and brings massive value to a development.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the Turkish construction industry in recent years, especially since the crisis?</h4><p>The crisis did not hit the construction industry in Turkey as severely as other regions. People had land, and they continued building on it. Some companies held onto land and have now resumed building again. The construction industry didn't shut down, it merely slowed temporarily. In 2010 we saw another boom, and we anticipate 2012 and 2013 being exceptional years also.</p><h4>What is the status of the Rixos Hotel project?</h4><p>Rixos is a large hotel chain, and popular throughout the world. The project we are developing there is unique. It is being developed in the style of a residential building, including mostly loft-style suites, but will operate as a hotel. The hotel will give visitors the option to stay for as long as they like. We are seeing good investments, and our clients believe in our projections. We have a contract with Rixos for 25 years, and the location—Taksim—is excellent. We talked with other hotel chains, but decided that Rixos was the best option. Rixos means luxury and quality, and we are happy to be bringing it to Istanbul. The smallest unit is 85 square meters in size, and our larger suites are up to 180 square meters. Our presidential suite is 350 square meters. There will be 140 fully furnished suites in total. Even though people can stay for as long as they like, our target is for shorter trips of a few days, catering to top business executives in town for meetings and so forth. It is like a home away from home, a full apartment with a hotel feeling.</p><h4>What opportunity is there in Istanbul for further hotel developments?</h4><p>Istanbul needs city hotels. This can be determined by a simple calculation. With around 800 flights landing in Istanbul each day, it is obvious that the city is packed with business people. City hotels are what is needed to provide the right accommodation for business travellers. These hotels need to be well connected, to the airports and to the main business districts. That is what makes the Rixos project so special. Its location is perfect. In Taksim alone there are 10 five-star hotels, including Metro Park, Swissí´tel, Intercontinental, Hyatt, and the Ritz-Carlton. The total number of rooms is 1,400. The four-star hotels in the region have occupancy rates of 90% to 95% over the whole year, and the occupancy rate for five-star hotels is 80% to 85%. This gives you an idea of how urgent the need is for more hotels.</p><h4>Would you say that MICE tourism is one of the main drivers for tourism in Istanbul?</h4><p>Yes. It is this fact that is driving our focus. We have another hotel project underway in Kasımpaşa, close to Taksim. It will be a four-star hotel, catering to both pleasure and MICE tourists alike. We are currently negotiating with three major international chains: Marriot, Hilton, and Wyndham. The selected chain will fully manage the development, which will contain conference and meeting facilities.</p><h4>You have talked about your developments in Istanbul. What do you think the prospects are for these kinds of developments in other cities in Turkey?</h4><p>The other major cities beside Istanbul are Ankara and Izmir. Other developing cities include Bursa, Gaziantep, Kayseri, and Konya. There are city hotels in these areas, yet we are looking to develop the market further in the future. The next target is Ankara. As the economy grows there will be an increase in demand for city hotels in these areas, and international brands will step up their presence in the country.</p><h4>Are there any regulation challenges that the company has encountered?</h4><p>Every country has its own rules and regulations, and that is the same for Turkey. Ofton buys land that is authorized for sale by municipalities. It then develops the land and sells it on for a profit. We also work with companies that have land and want to work with us in its development. The regulations are very simple, and the municipality must be obeyed in terms of height restrictions and the like. We have a successful track record at finishing projects on time, and are continuously looking to develop new ideas for the future.</p><h4>Seeing that the company is playing a significant part in developing the tourism industry in Turkey, do you receive assistance from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism or the government specifically?</h4><p>The Ministry of Culture and Tourism is always ready to help any company that is potentially investing and helping the development of the tourism sector. Our work is being recognized in Ankara, and this is because of the significant role we are playing in the development of the economy. The government is doing a lot to encourage investment into the development of hotels and resorts.</p><h4>Turkish companies have huge international experience. What has made Turkish companies so successful in this sector abroad?</h4><p>Turkish people bring a certain level of professional involvement to projects. They do not give out too much business to contractors, and that has kept Turkish businesses successful in the construction sector abroad. The government also helps such companies with tax advantages. This is because those companies are providing a service for the country, raising its profile and providing work for its people.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Ofton, and the tourism and construction sector in 2011 and in the years ahead?</h4><p>Rixos will be opened in the summer of 2011, and by 2012 our other hotel development will be complete. Ofton will also continue in its residential developments, and we will go from strength to strength. This will be assisted as regeneration begins, aimed at preparing the country for earthquakes. The strong connections the government is building with its neighbors are also going to be positive for the economy and our concerned sectors. In terms of tourism, we expect the sector to develop well over 2011 and 2012 as well. Turkey has the facilities to support year-round tourism, and this also makes Turkey special. All that is left to do is to develop more hotels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey is the largest exporter of agriculture products in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. What are Turkey's competitive advantages in agriculture, particularly the crop sector?</h4><p>Turkey has substantial production potential for horticulture products, which only few countries have, due to its geographical and ecological conditions. In this respect, Turkey is one of the most important countries as it is the homeland and gene pool of several fruits. The seed sector also has several advantages due to favorable climatic and geographical conditions. In addition, Turkey has a large domestic market and is close to the Middle East, Europe, and Central Asia. The government is working hard on incentive and subsidy deals, and there is strong collaboration between the public and private sectors. Turkey is full of well-trained workers, and the overall infrastructure is also beneficial. New studies are underway for the development of new seed varieties, and investments are being made through international seed companies in Turkey. Seed production is carried out in compliance with international standards, and this also helps exports.</p><h4>What are the primary strategies of Turkey's post-ARIP agriculture policy?</h4><p>The Agricultural Reform Implementation Project (ARIP), which was applied between 2001 and 2008, is composed of four main principals, including direct income support, alternative product development, the reconstruction of agriculture sales cooperatives and unions, and project support services. Under post-ARIP primary implementations, and in agricultural supports, an efficiency- and quality-driven product based support system is in process to increase welfare levels in the agricultural sector by providing rural development and by developing agricultural products in line with domestic and foreign demand, protecting and developing natural and biological resources, increasing efficiency, reinforcing food reassurance and security, improving producer organizations, and by empowering agricultural markets. In addition, agricultural supports are being made in different amounts with respect to priorities and preferences like region, enterprise, land, product, agricultural system, contracted production, rehabilitation, rural development, and environment and through producer organizations. In determining the product and amount, quality, standards, and health criteria are taken into account. In the forthcoming period efficiency in agricultural policies will be increased by establishing an integrated administration and control system.</p><h4>What steps have you taken to bring Turkey's agricultural policies into line with those of the EU?</h4><p>The objective of agricultural policies is to solve the prioritized problems in the sector, increasing the efficiency of implementing policies and facilitating the adjustment in the sector to the impacts of these policies. In this respect, Turkey has recently started long-term planning for the agricultural sector and published the “Agricultural Policy Paper 2006-10 and Strategic Plan 2010-13" to bring Turkey's agricultural policies into line with those of the EU. In the last decade, 13 main regulations have come into force to comply with EU legislation. The studies on secondary legislation and a few main regulations are in progress. An agency has been established to support Turkish farmers in order to develop their mechanical and technical capacity to be more effective in the international markets. Important progress has been made regarding horizontal issues such as establishing legal infrastructure to secure good practice.</p><h4>What specific measures is your Ministry taking to facilitate and encourage innovation and technology in agriculture?</h4><p>Turkey's R&amp;D expenditure rose to 0.85% of GDP in 2010. The target is 2%. In parallel to this trend, the nation's agricultural R&amp;D expenditure has also increased. The public sector continues to be largely responsible for knowledge management. Under the administration of the Ministry, the General Directorate for Agricultural Research (GDAR), which has 58 research institutes, is responsible for conducting research into all domains of agriculture and this body supports R&amp;D micro projects applied by the private sector, universities, and NGOs. The strategic aim of seeking collaboration among universities, institutions, organizations, and companies in order to develop knowledge and technology led to reforms in the Agriculture Law, which were adopted in 2006 and subsequently created an enabling environment for the development of agricultural innovation. Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) were established to eliminate regional disparities, to accelerate local and regional economic development, and to enable sustainable development. There are now 26 RDAs across the country and they are responsible for developing an R&amp;D and innovation strategy. The main policy document of Turkey, the Ninth Development Plan (2007-13), contains actions for agricultural innovation related issues. It emphasizes the importance of R&amp;D under the strategic objective of “increasing competitiveness" to contribute to the economic and social development of Turkey as well as the regional development policy and cluster development. In order to develop agricultural production and to extend new technologies in the agricultural sector, practical farmer training and demonstration works have been effectively implemented.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to support the animal husbandry sector?</h4><p>The investment support activities carried out by our Ministry in animal husbandry include developing the practice in the Southeast and East Anatolia regions. New establishments of between 50 and 300 dairy cows or between 50 and 300 meat and combined breed cattle will be given grants covering 30% of total construction costs as well as 40% of their animal purchase costs. Within this scope, 44 of 134 projects with 5,962 animals in the Southeast Anatolia region and 64 of 105 projects with 5,797 animals in the East Anatolia region have been completed. The main aim of this application is to improve both dairy cattle breeding and other cattle breeding establishments. These subsidies are given within the scope of the East Anatolia and Southeast Anatolia projects that are specific to those regions and they include social, cultural, environmental, and economic issues with the aim of increasing per capita income and employment, increasing development activities, protecting the environment, improving and sustaining development, establishing industry and service centers, and stopping emigration.</p><h4>Turkey currently uses about 16.2 million hectares of its 24.3 million hectares of arable land. What opportunities and challenges does Turkey's land potential present?</h4><p>Turkey in general has a rich geographical content that contains different elements and characteristics. In 2009, with a decision from the Council of Ministers, 30 agricultural basins have been determined by way of accessing 527 million data stock in terms of their climate, soil, topography, land types, and ways of cultivation. The objective of the Agricultural Basin Support and Production Model is to support the cultivation of the most suitable products in the most suitable agricultural basins that are formed in line with their climate, soil, and topography in terms of those products' ecological needs. In this respect, the Agricultural Basin Support and Production Model aims to put a strategy in place to implement the activities for comparatively complying the rules of the WTO and EU about support systems and to increase competitiveness, decrease the rate of public financing, enable the balance of supply and demand, maximize producer profit, increase efficiency, protect soil and water resources, and ensure production planning, which are the basic needs of the agriculture sector. A land-based support system has also been developed for each of the 30 basins in terms of their ecological, topographical, and agricultural characteristics. The process of implementing the model in the coming period is continuing.</p><p>There are lands suitable for organic agriculture all over Turkey and organic agriculture has been increasing over recent years. The land used for organic agriculture was about 1.58% of the arable land in 2010. In general, 4.3 million hectares of land are left fallow every year. Recently, studies have been continuing into better utilizing land for plant production, and there are positive signs that the research is paying off, and all arable land will be in a position to be cultivated within the next 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Three Main Components]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-three-main-components]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following record high sales in 2010, what is your outlook for sales and profitability in 2011?<br></h4><p>Gübretaş has been providing fertilizer to the Turkish agriculture sector since 1953, and in 2009 we had record high sales, but this was not reflected in our profits mainly due to high inventory levels resulting from the global economic crisis. In 2010 we set a new sales record of 1.45 million tons and experienced profits of around TL150 million. In 2011 we are expecting 1.57 million tons in sales, and we are very hopeful.</p><h4>What has been the impact of your acquisition of Iran's Razi Petrochemical Company in 2008?</h4><p>As you know, there are three major components of fertilizer, namely nitrogen, potassium, and phosphate. Turkey is lacking these raw materials, so our search for natural resources led us to Iran, which has the second largest natural gas reserves in the world. When Razi Petrochemical Co. was privatized a consortium led by Gübretaş purchased 95.62% of the company, giving us a strong value position for nitrogen, the first input in fertilizer. The facility is 877,000 square meters in size, with 13 plants, 2,500 employees, and a capacity of approximately 4 million tons.</p><h4>Do you have plans for further acquisitions outside of Turkey?</h4><p>We are in constant search of these types of opportunities. Now that we have acquired a facility for nitrogen, the next goal is phosphate, which is abundant in North Africa.</p><h4>What was your motivation for the purchase of the shipping company Negmar?</h4><p>As we have over a million tons of products and material to transport, there is a need for us to be in logistics. Apart from this need, we also see a high potential for profitability in this sector. We currently have four bulk carriers. In a couple of years we plan to see this number increase to 10. Our fleet operates for our needs and also for the needs of the free market.</p><h4>What have been the biggest changes in Gübretaş since you came to the company seven years ago?</h4><p>Our stock market value was about $30 million seven years ago, and now it is about $1 billion. Our market share was about 13-14%, now it is around 29%. We were a local player, now we are a global player. A study by the Turkish national edition of Fortune magazine concluded that Gübretaş had been the “Fastest Growing Company in Turkey" for the last three years. On top of this we are growing in line with the Turkish economy.</p><h4>In that context, what are the strengths and challenges of Turkey's economy?</h4><p>In terms of challenges, Turkey lacks capital sources as well as natural resources. On the other hand, Turkey has a talented and hardworking population. Turkey is adaptable to the needs of a changing modern business world, while at the same time able to maintain its moral values.</p><p>In recent years we have enjoyed a stable political environment, which is good for the economy and allows us to create an important political and economic balance in the region. Turkey is currently the 16th biggest economy in the world and the eighth biggest in terms of agriculture. My personal view is that we will continue rising in both of these categories.</p><h4>Gübretaş is known for its corporate social responsibility. Where are your social initiatives currently focused?</h4><p>Our main audience for these activities are farmers, and we are focused on education and raising awareness within this group. Our motto is: “conscious farmers win". In this respect we are working with universities to enlighten farmers and those involved in the agriculture sector. For example, we provide scholarships to the children of farmers who study agriculture at 25 different universities. We are also motivating farmers to do soil analysis in order to utilize the appropriate products.</p><h4>What are the biggest issues facing Turkey's agriculture sector?</h4><p>The inability to achieve economies of scale based on the amount of arable land is the main challenge. The need to modernize farming is another one. At the macro level, the biggest problem is agricultural planning. In recent years, however, there has been strong progress in these areas. The fact that the value of agriculture exports is rising along with per capita income is proof of this. Of course, we are directing ourselves toward products that add value in these ways.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Gübretaş?</h4><p>We are going to continue strengthening our position as a global player, increasing and diversifying our production in geographic areas with the right natural resources and raising awareness among farmers.</p><p>We are also now working to develop region or plant-specific fertilizers to increase the soil and crop quality. Our aim is to continue maintaining the balance between creating profitability for our shareholders and maintaining our social responsibility to educate and improve the lives of farmers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-gift-of-dionysus]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate viticulture in Turkey compared to other wine-producing countries in Europe?</h4><p>We look at viticulture in terms of its growth rate. Turkey is fifth in the world for production; however, only 2-3% of those grapes are used in wine. The rest is consumed or turned into raisins and exported. We have an excellent environment with a lot of growing potential. In terms of viticulture, Turkey is blessed with land, soil, and farming. Thrace and western Anatolia are very promising areas and are growing in terms of quality.</p><h4>How would you describe the emergence of Turkey's wine industry over the last century?</h4><p>The wine industry in Turkey is only 80 years old, but wine making here is ancient. It has existed for years, but it was stalled and restarted again in the 1920s. Serious viticulture investments started in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, Turkey really began growing grapes in the 1980s, when tourism began to develop, increasing demand. This boosted wine producers, bringing them into a position to invest. During the 1980s, the first facilities and equipment to optimize production quality were introduced into the sector. However, no matter how great your facilities are, if the grape you start with isn't excellent enough there is only so much you can do with it afterwards. In the 1990s investments into viticulture picked up, and we began examining the grapes and learning how to grow and manage them. We started seeing the yields of these investments in 2003 and 2004. Our first viticulture management vineyards started up in 1990, and we are in our 20th year. Turkey is destined to make some great wines one day, but it takes time.</p><h4>How would you rate the current perception of Turkish wine globally?</h4><p>We still have a lot of ground to cover. For a long time, France, the US, Chile, South Africa, Spain, and Italy have been the main names in the great wine encyclopedia. Turkey has traditionally been included under the “others" category. However, lately we have been seeing a rise in interest in Turkish wines. The market in the past was small and scattered, but there has been a significant consolidation under the “Wines of Turkey" umbrella, and we are trying to put Turkey on the map. There is a collaborative effort to invest and market ourselves as Turkish wines, with the aim of changing the image of the country. The only missing piece to the puzzle is the government. The sector has not received the same kind of support as the industries in Chile, Australia, or South Africa. Our goal is to make Turkey synonymous with wine. Within the last five to seven years there has been a lot more international attention, and an increase in the number of international wine writers coming to Turkey. It has now been recognized and put in print that a lot has changed in Turkey. Some of the potential has been realized, and there is a lot more potential to exploit.</p><h4>How have you seen the domestic awareness and appreciation of wine change in recent years?</h4><p>It has grown in selective communities and metropolitan areas and in the more Westernized parts of Turkey. We don't see an enormous growth in consumption as there was in the mid-1990s. The whole industry was doing well—wine became a status symbol and people became more selective. That trend is continuing now in narrower areas, despite anti-alcohol efforts in the country. But when you look nationwide our numbers are not growing all that much anymore. Revenues are increasing in terms of the people who are already drinking wine, upgrading to better quality wines, but the growth isn't like what we used to see, especially if you take Turkish tourism out of the equation. Turkey sells about 40% of its wine to tourists. The current difficulties come from many things—high taxation being one of them. Turkey has the highest tax base of all wine-making countries. If you want to apply for a liquor license, it can take up to a year. Without these roadblocks we could lower the cost of wine and make it more available to the general population, and in turn increase the affordability of wine. Despite these challenges, however, we are still conducting business and  pushing through.</p><h4>What are your biggest markets, and in which countries do you see the most potential demand for Doluca wines?</h4><p>Turkey is our biggest market. Domestic sales account for 85% and 15% is exported. Of that 15% the largest market is Germany for two reasons. First, the biggest population of Turks outside of Turkey is in Germany. Second, over the last 50 years Germany has sent us the largest amount of tourists. Germans are quite familiar with our wines, and you will see Turkish wine in the non-Turkish areas of Germany. Then comes non-wine producing countries such as the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavian countries. We are also interested in seeing what the growth potential could be in China and the US. In order to grow in all these areas we have to be competitive pricewise, and we still cannot—even though we are tax exempt when exporting—as our production costs are higher than other countries. This is because many of our materials and supplies are imported, as supporting industries simply don't exist in Turkey. We are not producing as much as we can and a lot of it has to do with scale. Therefore, as we can't become a bulk line supplier, the option is to go into the niche markets and target the top restaurants.</p><h4>You represent the third generation for Doluca wines. What stamp will you leave?</h4><p>The stamp I want to leave is having put wine into people's daily existence. Wine has traditionally been something people think they need to be trained in, and that puts a lot of people off. We want to break these barriers and have people know that wine is just a drink to enjoy and appreciate. It's a matter of palate, not having to know which grape it was made from. I would also like to see an increase in the quality of wines and more brands offered to increase choice. Lastly, I would love to see Turkish wines better recognized on the world stage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-medicine]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Bayındır İçerenköy Hospital in Istanbul is the latest addition to the two existing Bayındır hospitals in Ankara and one Medical Center in Istanbul. Why was the decision made to open the hospital in Istanbul?</h4><p>Firstly, we are in the İş Bank Group, and İş Bank provides unlimited health support to its employees . Istanbul is our major center of operations, and so it makes sense that we are here so that we can better serve them. Secondly, the İş Bank Group always wants to be a player in the health sector. In order to do that you must have a presence in Istanbul. The two Bayındır Hospitals in Ankara—Söğutözü and Kavaklıdere—were established in 1992 and the Medical Center here in Istanbul started in 2009, and the latest step—but not the last—at İçerenköy, Istanbul took place in 2010.</p><h4>Why is İş Bank interested in the health sector?</h4><p>The first motivation is social responsibility. As a large group we feel an obligation both to provide quality care for our employees and to contribute to the quality and availability of health care in Turkey. The second motivation is business. Turkey has a growing population and a growing economy, so naturally this is a growth sector. But business is not the only thing.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the facilities and services?</h4><p>Between the two Ankara hospitals and the Istanbul Medical Center we have a total enclosed area of 33,000 square meters. The total bed capacity is 323 with 16 operating rooms, a diagnostic and medical imaging center, and medical laboratories. In addition, we have four dental clinics.</p><h4>What is Turkey's potential to become a significant player in the global medical tourism industry?</h4><p>Medical tourism is poised to be a major industry for Turkey. Some say it will worth $10 billion within 15 years. Personally, I'm not sure that is realistic, but there is potential. Right now we are an important medical destination for countries in the region, such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Russia, Azerbaijan, and the Balkans. But those countries will improve their healthcare sectors in 5 or 10 years,  and so we need to do more. Turkey's strengths are that it offers a cost advantage combined with quality. A hip replacement in Turkey, for example, costs $7,500 on average. The average price in the US is $130,000. The average price in Thailand, a major medical tourism destination, is $11,000. On top of this, Turkey has doctors whose experience and education are comparable to European doctors. We also have a strong legal framework, stronger than many of the typical medical tourism destinations.</p><h4>How important are international customers for your business, and what are your competitive advantages for attracting patients from abroad?</h4><p>Right now international patients are not a large part of our business. For 2011 we have targeted a gross income between $3 million and $4 million from international patients. However, we are targeting this area, and I hope that if we work properly this number will be $10 million in 2012. We are at the very beginning of this journey. In terms of advantages, we offer all-inclusive transparent pricing for surgery and procedures, hotel reservations, transfers, and a 24-hour concierge service. We provide international patients with the full translation of medical reports, a large number of specialists, coordination of pre-travel communications, and extensively tracked and monitored client outcomes. Our international patients enjoy timely access to care, especially relative to countries like Canada and the UK. Additionally, Bayındır is known for its specialization in procedures that are not always available abroad, like bone marrow transplantation.</p><h4>What are your main international markets?</h4><p>Today, our main markets are Azerbaijan as well as northern Iraq. Ukraine is also a good market. We are implementing an initiative in some of these areas called “Eurasia Medicine Days", held by Bayındır Healthcare Group and the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA). This annual program is supported by the participation of physicians from 10 countries, including the Caucasus, the Balkans, as well as the Middle East. We also travel to countries like Azerbaijan and run programs where our doctors provide care. This is a cooperative effort with the aim of providing the best possible care, but it also helps to grow our regional footprint.</p><h4>Bayındır was one of the first private hospitals in Turkey. Why is private health care important for the country?</h4><p>Public health care just isn't enough to satisfy Turkey's demand. And this demand is only going to get stronger. Not only that, but the country's economy depends on a strong private sector. Private sector activity in the healthcare sector is a good complement to state-funded medical care. It broadens capacity and helps to raise standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Çırağan Palace Kempinski Istanbul is consistently recognized as one of the best hotels in the world. What makes it so special?</h4><p>The soul of Çırağan Palace Kempinski is the people. Of course, we also benefit from the best location in the city. We have a very long piece of land on the Bosphorus, and this wonderfully restored Ottoman palace. Nobody has such a setup. But as I always stress to our staff, we can't depend on the location. The service has got to be there. Talking about service to Turkish people is a bit difficult as a foreigner because they basically invented hospitality. So all I do is fine-tuning, talking specifically about guest expectations. In 2010 we welcomed more than 120 nationalities. Different cultures have different expectations. Our challenge is being able to reach different cultures and expectations in order to deliver the best possible service. Luckily, we have a wonderfully capable staff, and we embrace this challenge.</p><h4>Out of these 120 nationalities, which represent your largest markets?</h4><p>There are five countries that represent 60% of our business. We are proud to say that number one is Turkey, but all of them are coming from abroad. In 2010 some 15% of our guests were Turks living abroad. This segment is continuously growing and we are extremely proud of this. These are Turkish people who have done very well for themselves, they come here to visit family and friends, and they choose Çırağan Palace Kempinski because it represents something special to them about their mother country. The same number of quests, 15%, came from the US. Americans have been very loyal to this hotel over the last 15 years, especially since John F. Kennedy Jr. came here for his honeymoon. That was a tremendous event for Çırağan Palace Kempinski, and put us on the map for US travelers. This is particularly true of up-market travel agents, who began to recommend us to the upper echelon of US travelers after that event. The popularity of Çırağan Palace Kempinski has been sustained ever since. About 70% of our US guests are leisure travelers, and a large number of them are repeat clients.</p><p>The third and fourth spots are tied between the UK and Germany, each representing 10% of our guests in 2010. We have steady business from both countries. The UK is more leisure oriented, and Germany is more business, reflecting a long tradition of commercial relations. The number five position in 2010 was France. Brazil was number six, which is very interesting. A few years ago this category was non-existent for us. Its growth represents the strengthening of relations between Brazil and Turkey. The first push was the agreements between the Brazilian-Turkish Chambers of Commerce, both here in Istanbul and in Sao Paolo. That was followed by the official visit of President Lulu and his wife, with all the major meetings taking place here in the Palace. Of course, this resulted in a lot of exposure in the Brazilian media. Next came Turkish Airline's non-stop Istanbul-Sao Paulo-Istanbul flight, which has recently increased its frequency to four times per week. As a result of these, Brazil has risen quickly on our list. It is an amazing story. In the number seven spot is the Middle East and the Arab Peninsula. This category is growing as well.</p><h4>In your career you've worked all over the world, particularly in East Asia. How does Istanbul compare?</h4><p>There is something very special here that I have not seen anywhere else in a natural setting. I arrived here with my wife on a Saturday, and we drove around the city for a couple of hours. We both had the initial impression that there is something Asian here, and I still feel this five years later. Not only geographically, since Istanbul has a foot in Asia and a foot in Europe, but the traits of the city itself reflect the best of Asia. For one it is a bustling city, but there are also the smiles, and the kindness of the welcome when you enter a shop or restaurant. There really is the best of both worlds here. And the history of the Ottoman Empire shows the way this area absorbed the best of many cultures, but there is also something uniquely Turkish. The food is a good example. It takes its influences from different areas, but it has been remodeled and repackaged, and now it's uniquely Turkish.</p><h4>Are there challenges in running a luxury hotel business on such a historic property?</h4><p>It is the hotel's 20th year and our 18th with the Palace. And the Palace has never been anything but a plus for us. We have to be careful, but this is not a negative at all. We are guardians of the Palace, which belongs to Turkey, to the Turkish government, and to the Turkish people. We are privileged to have the responsibility to keep it in shape. We want to absolutely preserve the physical integrity of the Palace as it should be. The Palace has an obvious grandeur. That is why it is famous, and that is why so many major social functions and high level political events are held here.</p><h4>The Turkish government is ambitiously targeting 50 million annual visitors by 2023, the centenary of the Republic. What do you feel should be done, by both the private and public sectors, to make this goal possible?</h4><p>We all need to continue promoting Turkey. In this sense, Turkish Airlines is doing a fantastic job. The amount and quality of advertising it is doing is absolutely incredible, and it helps all of us. Whether it is their ad campaigns with Kevin Costner, Kobe Bryant, or Caroline Wozniacki, it is not just advertising the airline but also Turkey itself, and it is clearly intending to do so. Everyone I've spoken to in the sector is full of praise for what the company is doing. I only fly Turkish Airlines these days because it flies to 99% of the places I go. This is a very strong arm to support the growth of tourism in Turkey, and this type of support will be important for us to reach such arrivals targets. It is important the country makes itself known, as there is a lot of competition. For example, when it comes to attracting big meetings, we aren't competing with hotels as much as we are competing with other cities like Paris and Barcelona.</p><p>Istanbul has always been a brand name, but it has become so again in a different sense, and I think this is key. An important element in this branding, specifically for Istanbul, is looking beyond the traditional attractions. Of course the top five attractions in Istanbul are amazing, and they are must-sees, but Istanbul is so diverse that you can visit 10 times and do something different each time. We should all work to raise the visibility of everything the city has to offer. For example, here at the hotel we are currently working on culinary tours, architectural tours, yacht tours, and even walking tours that may take people off the beaten track. There is simply no end to what this city has to offer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[orient-dreams]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was Pera Palace's original connection with the Orient Express?</h4><p>When the Orient Express extended its route to Istanbul as the last stop in the East, the city didn't have much in the way of accommodation possibilities, especially at the level of luxury that travelers of that age were accustomed to. The owners of the Orient Express started to look for their own hotel. This building was under construction at that time, and they took over the building. Construction started in 1892, and our history books indicate that the grand opening was held in 1895 with a grand ball. This hotel was very unique in the city because it was the meeting point of East and West. Even when you look at the architecture, elements of Art Nouveau, Oriental, and Neo-Classicism can be seen.</p><p>The architect was Alexander Vallaury, who designed many buildings in Istanbul. This was the first modern building in Istanbul, with iron and steel used in its construction. We worked with academics during the recent restoration of the building. It was the first building, aside from the Ottoman palaces and the American Hospital, to have electricity. The hotel boasted the first electric elevator in the country, which was installed only three years after the first elevator was installed in Europe at the Eiffel Tower.</p><h4>With all of this history, what were the challenges of undertaking such a major restoration project?</h4><p>When this hotel was built 120 years ago, there was no need for air conditioning or systems that provide Wi-Fi and internet. Nothing was in place. Installing this 21st century infrastructure without damaging the aesthetic and nostalgia was the biggest challenge of the restoration. As an example, in the grand ballroom, we couldn't touch the ceiling or the walls, so we installed ventilation through the floors. It was extremely challenging. Another challenge was the original stone exterior. We brought in 17 stone workers from Anatolia, and they worked manually without any electrical devices for 15 months. It was, however, both challenging and exciting as the hotel had never undergone a major restoration, and so we were able to see traces of the original building—some parts covered by seven or eight layers of paint. This was significant as we have thus been able to restore the building to exactly how it was. Pera Palace isn't an ordinary hotel. There are so many people in Istanbul who feel they have a strong connection with this property and have many memories. For this reason, while the four-year restoration project was underway, we attracted a lot of attention, and that resulted in a fantastic opening.</p><h4>How has your occupancy rate been since your reopening in September 2010?</h4><p>For the first four months, we closed with 50%. This was achieved  despite the usual downturn in occupancy rates seen over November and December. We even surpassed growth operating profit projections by 25%. As a newly opened hotel, this is a considerable amount. We have a team of 175 for 115 rooms. In the summer, we will increase staffing to 200. This allows us to deliver a high-end service that reflects the grandiose nature of the building. Our first full operational year will be 2011, and we are in line with our budget. We're planning to finish 2011 with an occupancy rate of 72% and a ‚¬250 average room rate.</p><h4>In terms of your guests by country, what are your primary markets?</h4><p>Our primary market is the UK at the moment, as well as the US and other European countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Spain. We have also had a lot of business from Japan, and a documentary was broadcast there in May 2011. A French TV crew filmed another documentary for TV3, and they were here for a month making a film called, “Legendary Cities, Legendary Hotels," in which legendary hotels from Marrakech, Venice, and Paris were also featured.</p><h4>Have you made a concerted effort to get your name out in the international market?</h4><p>We worked with a PR company in London to polish our image and create awareness that the hotel had been renovated. A lot of people were following the renovation keenly, and this put a lot of responsibility on our shoulders.</p><h4>You also attract a lot of events. Most recently the author Paulo Cuelho hosted an annual event here. How are events like this important for your vision of the hotel?</h4><p>I love Paulo Coelho personally, so it was great to have him here and also great publicity for the hotel. As well as other iconic names, every month on the third Thursday we have Pera Palace cultural get-togethers, and we host very important Turkish writers—big names whose books are translated into many languages. We opened in 2010 when Istanbul was the European Capital of Culture. We feel it is our responsibility to give some culture back to the city. To that aim, we have created a permanent exhibition in the hotel where we exhibit all the materials that were used in the early days of the hotel. We also have the Atatürk Museum room, which gives a special touch to the hotel. It is open for one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon to the public free of charge. In addition, the Yeşilçam Film Festival and İKSV Istanbul Film Festival were announced here. Recently, we also welcomed world renowned film star Kirsten Dunst, Terry Gilliam—director of Fisher King, 12 Monkeys and so on—and Michael Stipe, the soloist from REM for a cocktail they attended in the Pera Palace Hotel within the framework of the Istancool culture festival. We are really becoming the place to hold the most prestigious events in the city. The grand ballroom isn't big, but it's unique. As more events are held here the participation increases as people want to see the Pera Palace. It's in the middle of the city. The location is great. The Old City is only 10 minutes away, and when you leave the hotel, you find yourself in the middle of Istanbul's nightlife, and close to shopping centers, museums, and conferences halls.</p><h4>What distinguishes your cuisine offering?</h4><p>Agatha Restaurant opened alongside the hotel. We have a very talented German chef who has lived in Turkey for 18 years, which is a great asset for us. Turkish people have very specific taste preferences. Knowing this and applying it to international foods really makes a difference. When Agatha opened we decided to have a concept here that would take diners on an Orient Express taste journey through Paris, Venice, and Istanbul, with a fusion of French, Italian, and Turkish cuisine. The restaurant has received very positive reviews, and has become popular for business lunches and evening celebrations. We also opened the 300-square-meter Orient terrace in May 2011, and our guests are able to enjoy the sunset while dining. We turned the area into a garden, with plants, shutters, and music in the evening. We are also redecorating the Orient Bar, which used to be a gathering point for intellectuals in the evening. Additionally, we have a patisserie, which was once the only French patisserie in the city back then. In the lobby we also run an English tea service with butlers and live piano music. All of these aspects bring a certain liveliness to the hotel.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Hospitality Reigns]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hospitality-reigns]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mövenpick Hotel Istanbul was selected as the world's leading city hotel by the World Travel Awards. What makes this hotel exceptional?</h4><p>There's a personal touch to our service. We want to recognize our customers, get to know their likes and dislikes, and focus on the details. We listen to our customers and try and make their stay special. That means we need to have very good staff who are willing to take the extra step and go the extra mile. We're not reinventing the wheel—we just focus on good service. We mix Turkish hospitality with Swiss service quality. The good thing about Turkey is that people enjoy serving, they like welcoming people and making them feel looked after. The Swiss side is reliability. We deliver what we promise; we get back to our customers as soon as possible.</p><h4>How does 2011 compare to 2010 in terms of arrivals and occupancy?</h4><p>We're about 20-25% above 2010, which is huge. It's difficult to explain the reason for this increase, since there are no big events in 2011 compared to 2010, when Istanbul was the European Capital of Culture. But there's stability in the economy and also good investments in the industry, and so those probably had an effect.</p><h4>What do you think about Istanbul's potential to become a major MICE tourism destination?</h4><p>I think Turkey has everything to compete on the world stage in MICE tourism. Istanbul has top convention center facilities, and every year they get better. But Istanbul also has something else that's difficult to explain, Istanbul is possibly one of the most vibrant and inspiring cities in the world, where you can discover not only a dynamic cultural synthesis, but also some of the best shopping, dining, and nightlife anywhere. An effort was made to position Ankara and Izmir as major MICE destinations, but Istanbul really stands out as a magnet. Istanbul is not Turkey, it's unique. The infrastructure is also developing, even though it's still challenging. Geographically it is ideal for Europe, being only 3-4 hours from all the major cities. Turkish Airlines flies everywhere, with a great new fleet, great reach, lots of publicity, and membership in the Star Alliance. Those factors combined make accessibility a huge advantage.</p><h4>What is your capability to host business meetings and conferences here at Mövenpick?</h4><p>We have 250 rooms. We have a main ballroom that seats up to 400, and we have a smaller ballroom that seats up to 100, as well as 12 meeting rooms. We hosted the Google Europe meeting, as well as events by Nestlé and Bose, to name just a few. This size is perfect for us because it allows us to host significant events, but is not so big that we lose the ability to provide a personal touch to our guests.</p><h4>Having managed a number of hotels in Asia, how would you compare the hospitality industry there to Turkey?</h4><p>It's a bit similar to places like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Jakarta, especially in terms of its innate tradition of service and hospitality. But it's different, too. It has things that are European, things that are Asian, but then also something that is unique. I was in the Middle East for a while, in Bahrain and Beirut, but Istanbul is different. It has the same size, the same attitude, the same kind of service culture, and some religious similarities too, but Istanbul is very open. People still have the wrong idea about Istanbul and Turkey, it's often not what people expect. They expect less and get a lot more.</p><h4>The government is targeting 50 million arrivals by the year 2023. What do you think the public and private sector need to do to achieve that goal?</h4><p>I think Turkey is very reachable and very accessible, and I don't think that is an unrealistic goal. Turkey is a very safe place. That is a crucial factor. There is a diversity of attractions across Turkey that appeal to a broad range of people. Also, Istanbul still has room to expand in terms of hotels. Prices have risen and will continue to rise, which is natural considering the quality of service offered here.</p><h4>What are your most important markets, in Istanbul as well in the other Mövenpick hotels in Ankara and Izmir?</h4><p>In Istanbul it's the UK and Germany, and tourists from those countries represent almost half of all our business. Europe represents 60% overall, along with some Middle Eastern, Chinese, and Indian guests. About 40% is local. Izmir is mostly local and corporate, although there are some more leisure groups in summer, including Japanese and other Asian tour groups. Ankara is purely business and government guests, mostly domestic, and no leisure.</p><h4>Any plans for expansion?</h4><p>We'd like to have another hotel on the European side and one on the Asian side in Istanbul. We're also looking at Antalya, Kayseri, Adana, and Gaziantep. The challenge with those cities is that you will not get an average rate of ‚¬80. But we are an upscale hotel management company, so we don't want to go below an ‚¬80 room rate. That's the challenge.</p><h4>What's your vision for tourism in Turkey?</h4><p>It has a great future. It has the seas, the size, the diversity, the wealth, and the right attitude. It's geographically very well situated. It appeals to Europeans and people from the Middle East. It has a strong and developing infrastructure. It seems to be politically stable now. It's safe. You can fly here from almost anywhere. Turkish Airlines has a great reputation. The future is very bright indeed, and the economy is developing very rapidly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-journey-begins]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the successes of the 2023 Tourism Strategy thus far?</h4><p>Our 2023 strategy is one that focuses on cooperation between the public and private sectors in the tourism industry, while also seeking to ensure that the strategic planning goals that have been laid out are successfully applied. It contains policies on creating regional destinations, diversifying tourism and strengthening the transportation infrastructure.</p><p>The aim of the Turkey Tourism Strategy and Action Plan is to provide the sector with a directional road map concerning production, management, and application procedures. Such an approach enables this work to proceed and function in a regional, directional, and dynamic framework. This document brings to light the problems that need to be addressed in our national tourism sector, the institutions that will be responsible for finding solutions to those problems, along with the role each of them  will play.</p><p>Both plans aim to ensure that Turkey becomes a sustainable brand as a world tourism destination and a leading country in the world tourism industry, as a result of a visionary and consistent approach to tourism policy.</p><p>In order to attain these goals, we aim to make use of all of our country's natural, cultural, historic, and geographic resources while maintaining a balance between conservation and utilization. We also aim to expand alternative tourism, starting with health and thermal, cultural, winter, golf, eco, mountain plateau, congress, and fair tourism so that Turkey becomes a year-round destination, thereby increasing tourism revenues significantly.</p><p>Especially in the fields of culture and faith tourism, we have the potential not only to enhance our national tourism industry, but also to contribute to world peace. The kinds of excavations and discoveries currently going on in Denizli, İznik, and Manisa could make us a world leader in faith tourism. It's not just the Muslim and Christian faith that is represented in Turkey, but all faiths.</p><p>I can say that Turkey is very close to achieving its 2023 goals. Our aim is to become one of the world's top five tourism destinations with 50 million visitors annually by 2023. In 2002, we were 17th in terms of number of visitors, and in just eight years we've jumped 10 places to seventh. During the economic crisis, Greece, Spain, and France contracted by 3-4%, whereas we grew by 3-4%. In 2011 we're aiming at 30 million tourists and revenues of $25 billion.</p><h4>What are Turkey's comparative advantages as a leading international travel destination?</h4><p>Turkey is currently ranked seventh in the world in terms of number of visitors annually. This is a great success, but it also shows that Turkey's beauties and riches haven't as yet been fully discovered or appreciated. When I look at the riches and potential of our country, I feel that we deserve to be at least in the top three, if not number one. We have a magnificent heritage that cannot be found anywhere else in the world, all of which awaits visitors. We have different activities, destinations, boutique hotels, five- and seven-star hotels, thermal spas, beaches, historic treasures, museums, and art events that will appeal to anyone and everyone. Furthermore, you have access to all of these at a high level of quality and at affordable prices. Considering our traditional warmth and hospitality, this is a country where you can make lifelong friendships. This year's slogan is: “Turkey: a never-ending journey". Turkey is truly an unforgettable country that will leave you wanting more.</p><h4>What are your main targets and initiatives for 2011-2012?</h4><p>One of our main targets at the Ministry is to spread tourism over the entire country and over the entire calendar. So as to achieve these targets, we not only aim to further develop tourism dynamos like Istanbul, Antalya, Muğla, and Izmir, but also to open, develop, and promote other regions in various target markets. We want to bring thermal and cultural tourism to the fore so as to attract the high-income bracket. Our greatest advantage in cultural tourism is our extraordinarily rich historical heritage spanning all historic eras, a heritage full of treasures that are either on or will be on UNESCO's World Heritage List. Recently, the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne has also been included on that list, and we are working to add other cultural sites to the list while also promoting these sites worldwide.</p><h4>Do you feel Istanbul and Turkey have enough rooms to supply increasing demand?</h4><p>Here in the Ministry, we are very well aware of Turkey's potential. When setting a goal for ourselves, we naturally take the available infrastructure into consideration and whether it can support such projects. We now have countless accommodation facilities that offer international standards of comfort and quality. Most of them operate at a high occupancy rate. Keeping in mind the rising demand, we are working to implement projects that will cater to these needs.</p><h4>What is your strategy for the growth and development of the country's hospitality infrastructure?</h4><p>Tourism is a sector that is tied in with many other sectors, and this offers us endless opportunities for innovative solutions. We are a country that has proven itself with the quality service it offers. Now we're  working to ensure that this service quality is also environmentally and historically sensitive and aware. Every country has come to understand the importance of good service. I believe that we have truly established ourselves on the world scene with our blue-flag beaches and green-flag hotels, our hospitable and warm service, our historical riches, and our natural beauties.</p><h4>What is Turkey's potential to become a major medical tourism destination?</h4><p>One of the areas of tourism that we're seeking to develop and promote in particular is health tourism. Thermal tourism and health tourism are included together. We're currently number one in Europe in terms of thermal tourism. Our thermal hotels, spas, and other facilities are very popular and draw many visitors. Our aim is to develop all of these into five-star facilities. Once the quality of our facilities and the quality of our waters have synched, I believe that we can become the world's top country in this field</p><h4>Please tell us about any major renovation, reconstruction, or recovery projects currently being spearheaded by your Ministry?</h4><p>Work continues at 151 sites all over Turkey to offer the world new treasures from our cultural heritage. Restoration work also continues on existing historic structures. Extensive work has just been completed in the Hagia Sophia, having brought to light the magnificent “seraphim" mosaic. For us, every historical artifact is of utmost importance, and we therefore support all recovery, excavation, and restoration work concerning any and all sites, structures, and pieces. Very important work continues in Antalya, Denizli, Gaziantep, Diyarbakır, Muğla, and other areas. As the number of artifacts we recover increases, so does our need for museums to house them in, and we at the Ministry do whatever we can to meet these needs. In addition to places on the UNESCO list such as Istanbul's historical sites, Hattuşa, Pergamum, Ephesus, and Bitlis Ahlat, we are also continuing restoration work on places like Sagalassos, Myra, and Ani. Recently Mimar Sinan's famed Selimiye Mosque in Edirne was added to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in Paris on June 27, 2011. We hope that other historical sites such as Alanya and Ephesus will also be added to the list in the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have passenger number trends changed over the last few years, and what are the reasons behind this?</h4><p>The volume of trade between Turkey and the Middle East region is booming. Political ties are also getting stronger. From our perspective we have seen double-digit growth in passenger volumes between the regions. We have a lot of construction companies doing business in the region and they travel in big volumes as their projects can last years, with many passengers travelling back and forth.</p><h4>What is the passenger load factor between Istanbul and Bahrain?</h4><p>Currently we are running at around a 70% load factor. That is the average. It can go as high as 85% during peak times. We have capacity to meet demand during all periods.</p><h4>How do you see Istanbul developing as a transit hub, and how does this fit into Gulf Air's worldwide operations?</h4><p>Istanbul is becoming increasingly important both as a destination and as a transit hub in the region. From Gulf Air's perspective Istanbul is purely a destination and  has always been important both strategically, and in tourism terms.</p><h4>What portion of passengers travelling between Bahrain and Istanbul are business travelers?</h4><p>Around 60% is business and 40% leisure.</p><h4>What is the level of freight services that Gulf Air operates?</h4><p>We fly four times a week with narrow-body aircraft. We carry 3-15 cubic meters volume of cargo. These are specifically low-density cargo such as spare parts, textiles, and the like.</p><h4>How did Gulf Air respond to the crisis?</h4><p>Like every airline, Gulf Air was affected by the crisis. Our 60-year history in aviation gave us the knowledge to get through this period. We have reacted to the crisis by changing the way we do business. We have become more proactive, more efficient, and faster in our service, and are working far more closely with our customers.</p><h4>During the crisis Turkish exporters to some extent switched their focus away from Europe and to the Middle East. Will this benefit Gulf Air in the long term?</h4><p>If you analyze the regions of the world, the Middle East was one of the least affected regions in the crisis, especially in the aviation business. We took advantage of this situation. We see bilateral trade developing further in textiles, food products, and consumer electronics.</p><h4>Turkish airlines was affected by rising fuel prices over 2010. Have fluctuating fuel prices affected Gulf Air?</h4><p>No airline is immune to fuel prices. Fuel prices make up as much as 30% of the operational costs of an airline. Therefore, we saw a great effect.</p><h4>What ambitions do you have for Gulf Air moving into 2011?</h4><p>During 2010 we opened eight new destinations and completed the first phase of our fleet renewal program. We will continue to expand further during 2011 as well. I want Gulf Air to achieve good results on these strategic decisions. Turkey's own results are included in this.</p><h4>Where is Gulf Air trying to position itself amongst other Gulf region based airlines?</h4><p>Previously we used to compete with these carriers on almost every route, and as a result we were unable to gain  market dominance, especially on long- and medium-range routes.</p><p>Our new strategy differentiates us from our regional competitors. Our focus is now to find and maintain under-served niche markets where we can have a leadership position. Our new fleet gives us the flexibility to do this.</p><h4>What are the benefits of operating out of Bahrain?</h4><p>We have the unique advantage of operating the largest network in the Middle East. Bahrain's strategic location and prominence as the freest economy in the Middle East region helped us to connect Bahrain with other important financial centers in the world. This is where we want to be. Our brand name is very well established in Turkey. We would like to encourage trade transactions between the two countries. We would also like to encourage people to see Bahrain as a tourist destination.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY Doğa Koleji has become a well-known institution in Turkey. What was the aim you had when founding the school?</h4><p>Doğa Koleji was established in 2001. Time Education Group already had several private courses in its portfolio, and we believed that we should have a place in the private school market, too. In our first year we had only 100 students and one school. Now, in our ninth year, we have 15,000 students and 25 pre-schools, 20 primary schools, 18 junior high schools, and 15 high schools. We also have 2,500 employees and are the leader of the sector in terms of student count, success, vision, and targets.</p><h4>Could you tell us a little about the school's “nature concept"?</h4><p>Doğa, or “nature", Koleji has integrated nature into every aspect of its curriculum from mathematics to philosophy. This is the first time such a concept has been implemented in Turkey, and perhaps in the world. Other institutions have included nature into their concepts; however, this has usually only been in an extra-curricular sense. Our schools not only have campuses with extensive gardens, and a large variety of plants, vegetables, and animals, but also fully immerse the students into nature as we can find superb examples within the environment to aid the teaching of all subjects. We are dedicated to the environment, and our schools raise nature-conscious, conservation-minded individuals.</p><h4>What else sets your school apart from its competitors?</h4><p><span></span>The basic philosophy of Doğa Koleji is that education is life. Our basic education model is shaped by this idea. Education is not only in the classroom—our students participate in numerous projects, competitions, and field trips. Before Doğa Koleji, the private school sector was practically non-existent in Turkey. The private schools that did exist were perceived as playgrounds for rich, spoilt children. Their quality was low and they were not very successful. Doğa Koleji changed everything. The sector came alive because of Doğa Koleji. For the first time private schools gained a corporate image. Now, schools try to emulate our success as a successful business model. Doğa Koleji has changed the landscape of education in Turkey. It has raised the bar in terms of the quality of education available, and the standards the industry now sets itself. Our school is the pioneer, and we are truly proud of this.</p><h4>This concept has clearly worked well for Doğa Koleji. How has the school's expansion strategy developed over the years?</h4><p>From the beginning our target has been 100,000 students. This target has an economic value and is the prerequisite for recognition as a quality, well-known brand. We gave ourselves 10 years time to achieve 25,000 students and are on target. When this is achieved our real fight will begin. We will have a real responsibility in our sector, in the country, and in world education. We say we will be more vocal in the sector, and our words will have meaning. From thereon in we hope to attain the 100,000 target. Following this our plans are purely international.</p><h4>How are you attracting students to achieve your targets, and what is your typical student profile?</h4><p>Wherever we open a school, the clientele is assessed and the school is planned accordingly. We use means of advertising suitable to the school we will open. Our flagship school is in Acarkent, which is the most affluent area in Istanbul in terms of income. It includes certain facilities and programs that are absent in our Bostancı school, and this is reflected in the tuition fees. However, our nature concept and levels of education are always maintained. In this way we encompass a large demographic. When we first advertised our school we used an international advertising company. Our vision required it. Our school has also appeared in high-profile television series. We have the children of well-known public figures attending our schools and this also works to promote our school.</p><h4>You mentioned your future aims to go international. A step has already been made in this area with the opening of a Doğa school in Canada. How did this come about and how will future international growth develop?</h4><p>The opening of this school came about by coincidence, and has given us the experience necessary for future growth abroad. First we will complete our Turkish agenda. Until then we will not have other activities abroad. We have contacts abroad and in the countries we are interested. We will keep these items on our agenda and look at the issue again in the near future.</p><h4>To make these projects a reality, how is Doğa Koleji making itself a known brand domestically and throughout the world?</h4><p>We have undergone a prominent branding process in Turkey already, and are working to further increase the strength of our name. The motto of our advertising strategy is “new generation education". We want people to be aware of our focus on more technology, more success, more projects, more international relations, and more social communications. Also, through the iPhone everybody will be able to see everything related to Doğa. This is a first for an educational institution in Turkey, and we have worked with Apple to achieve this.</p><h4>How do you prepare your high-school students for university?</h4><p>Our high schools operate an MBA for teenagers (t-MBA) program. This program was prepared entirely by us, and is accredited internationally by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There are 12 courses in the program and they are instructed by university academics. The program encompasses every aspect of school life. Also, the schools are governed by student councils. Each school has a student president and he or she is in a managerial position. He or she directs education, including many prestigious international projects. For example, we are the partner in Turkey for the IDEA debate club. Every year a gathering is held—last year it was in Amsterdam and the previous year London. In 2011 it will be held in Turkey. We are expecting around 1,000 students from 80 countries to attend and it is something we have lobbied extensively for. It will be superb for the economy and we have received significant governmental support. We also have a partnership with Istanbul University, and our instructors are able to obtain certification from this institution. We have conducted numerous joint programs including a scientific experiment at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland. Next year we will also open a new school with Istanbul University.</p><h4>How do you assess the current situation regarding the higher education sector in Turkey?</h4><p>As the number of high-school graduates grows we need more universities. As these universities open they will also look to attract students from abroad. This will shape the future of Turkish universities. We will see marketing strategies implemented in specific countries in order to achieve this.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of the EU's Turkey 2010 Progress Report?</h4><p>The 2010 Turkey Progress Report is the most positive and encouraging one among the 13 reports released by the Union so far. Turkey has taken remarkable steps since 1998 when the EU's first Progress Report was released. Turkey now has a different and unique position thanks to it being the fastest growing economy in Europe, its rapidly improving democratic standards, and its active foreign policy. Turkey's efforts for regional peace and stability, its relations with EU-member states—and particularly its ties with Greece—as well as the Turkish economy's flexibility against the global crisis were some of the issues highlighted in the Progress Report.</p><p>It was also a positive development that the European Commission had confirmed Turkey's progress in all chapters. Despite the chapters blocked due to political reasons, it is of great importance that the report pointed to Turkey's progress in all chapters. This is a confirmation of our determination on our path to the EU.</p><p>I do not claim that Turkey is perfect in every aspect. The country still has major issues to solve. However, when we compare the current situation with the past, we can say that Turkey is in a much better place. Tomorrow, it will be in a much greater position.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey now has a different and unique position thanks to it being the fastest growing economy in Europe."</div><h4>Following the successful referendum on constitutional change, are we going to see a reinvigorated push in EU-related reforms?</h4><p>The referendum has really shown the extent to which the Turkish people believe in a demanding kind of democracy, in human rights, and the market economy. By voting “yes" in the referendum on a new Constitution, the Turkish public gave a strong mandate for the Europeanization project, wiping away the remnants of the military constitution, leading to a fully fledged democracy and EU membership. Having taken this step, we are going to continue with reforms, and we will take all the necessary first steps so that Turkey becomes a country that answers to European criteria, so that the people of Turkey benefit from a higher standard of living.</p><p>We are now working very hard to adopt harmonization laws in line with the 2010 constitutional amendments. However, the most important step will be a new constitution after the June 2011 elections.</p><h4>Are you concerned that Turkey's strengthening relations with non-EU neighboring countries will be construed as a relinquishing of EU accession aspirations?</h4><p>Just find Turkey's position on the world map. You will see that Turkey is not where East and West are divided, but where East and West come together, and this is what makes Turkey so unique. This would be a great opportunity for the EU to prove itself as a peace project. Turkey's membership would be the antithesis of the clash of civilizations and would prevent new polarizations in the world. We act as an intercultural bridge. Can there be a bridge with only one sound leg? We want to be a bridge that is strong enough to trust. We always attached importance to the Western leg of this bridge, but somewhat neglected the Eastern leg in the past. During the rule of the AK Party, based on the fact that this bridge can be strong only if both legs are strong, we began EU negotiations and also assumed the position of the secretariat general in the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Meanwhile, we became the co-chair of the project for the Alliance of Civilizations.</p><p>In fact, strengthening relations with the concerned countries means more dialogue and more cooperation, not only for Turkey, but for the whole of Europe as well. Turkey's historical ties with those countries provide a great opportunity for the EU. As Turkey gets closer to the EU in the next 15 years, it will become a more prominent country in the Islamic world. As Turkey gets closer to the Islamic world, it will become a more important country for Europe. As we get closer to one side, our relations with the other side do not get weaker. On the contrary, relations with one side make relations with the other side stronger. Such relations are complementary to each other. Turkey would really be a bridge. Just as 1.5 billion Muslims watch Turkey's EU process closely, 500 million Europeans will begin observing Turkey's relations with the Islamic world.</p><p>Turkey's peaceful and conciliatory activities all over the world weren't in contradiction with the foreign policies of the EU. Actually, Western countries establish all kinds of relationships with countries in the Middle East, but as for the Turkey, they say: “Does its axis lapse?" The Turkish nation has not changed its course for 1,000 years. Nobody intends to nor has the strength to change this course.</p><h4>What economic opportunities does Turkey offer the European Union?</h4><p>Turkey and the European Union need each other, but Turkey's need for the Union continues to decrease while the Union's need for Turkey grows bigger with each passing day. We adopted a new slogan: “Hold on tight, Europe. Turkey is coming to your rescue!"</p><p>There is an economic crisis in Europe, but Turkey entered a gradual recovery period relatively quickly. It is Europe's sixth largest economy, with an 11% growth rate. Turkey's accession will increase the size of the European internal market as well as the competitiveness of the EU in the global economy, if you consider its dynamic 70+ million population and the 1.5 billion consumers around Turkey. In other words, Turkey will make the EU cake bigger. Turkey hosted the leaders of 150 countries in spring 2011 for a summit of less-developed countries. And it will assume the term presidency of the summit for the next 10 years. As well, Turkey is the secretary-general of the OIC as well as the co-chair of the Alliance of Civilizations. Turkey is also one of the reputable countries among the G-20's member states. The EU cannot ignore such an active country.</p><h4>What would EU accession mean for Turkish business leaders?</h4><p>EU countries have the biggest share in Turkey's exports. Our exports to Europe are on the rise in terms of size. Although its total share is declining, the EU's share in total exports from Turkey is 46.3%. Actually, the Customs Union was a turning point for Turkish investors. Turkish business people gained great access and opportunities in the European market. They had a broader vision. Starting the negotiations with the EU was another turning point as they reach the capacity to compete and cooperate with their European counterparts. Turkey also quadrupled its FDI after the negotiations started because it means more democracy, more stability, and more predictability. We attract more foreign investors and this has created a new synergy between Turkish and foreign business people.</p><h4>What do you believe Turkish leaders could bring to decision making and reform processes within the European Union, and how would this be mutually beneficial?</h4><p>There is no doubt that Turkey becoming a full member of the European Union, and sharing European values, rules and principles, has a lot to contribute to the soft power of the EU. With the second largest army in NATO and its strategic location,  Turkey would support EU goals not only in terms of soft power but also in terms of peacekeeping capability and global reach.</p><h4>Have there been any negotiations aimed at relaxing visa restrictions for Turkish citizens in the European Union?</h4><p>It is an unacceptable fact to see Turkish citizens waiting in front of the consulates and embassies of EU member states when we have had intense relations for 52 years. Our people are sick of waiting in lines outside EU embassies, having to produce millions of papers only to be turned down frequently for no good reason. Citizens of countries that have not yet started negotiations with the EU like Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia enter European countries without visas. Although Turkey has been in the EU process since 1959, it makes 60% of its foreign trade with Europe, and is a member of all institutions of Europe, it has to fulfill visa requirements. There is insincerity here. We are face to face with the double standards of Europeans. Imagine a Turkish company doing business with Europe involving millions of euros, but the owner of the company still faces difficulties getting a visa? That is obviously negative discrimination. Turkey is now a negotiating country. This should be made a priority as it symbolizes that Europe is open to Turkey. Turkey now has biometric passports, is near to completing a readmission agreement, and is getting closer by the day to reaching EU requirements for a visa-free regime.</p><h4>What do you hope to see in the way of visa reform?</h4><p>There are fears in Turkey against the European Union and fears against Turkey in the EU. And what is the real underlining reason for these fears? We do not know one another enough. People usually fear countries they do not know enough about. Once you get to know them, you find out their strengths and weaknesses, and then you realize there is nothing to be afraid of. The abolition of visas will be the most important step to ease those fears. The argument that Turkey is just too big and too poor simply holds no weight anymore. Turkey's economy is far better than many EU members. If anything, Turkey could be importing labor from EU member states in the not too distant future.</p><h4>How important has the subject of energy been during European Union accession negotiations, and can Turkey help meet Europe's energy needs?</h4><p>Turkey has been a bridge and a hub for centuries. We are the Eastern tip of the West, and the Western tip of the East. Turkey has been a bridge between Islam and Christianity, between civilizations and cultures, and also between energy resources and energy consumers. Over 70% of the crude oil and natural gas reserves that the EU needs are in the areas surrounding Turkey. Turkey, in this picture, will join the EU not to become a burden but to take some of the burden off the EU and contribute to a Union of leadership vision, diversity, and unity.</p><p>Turkey's cooperation is a must for Europe to resolve its energy crisis and Turkey is willing to become a part of the solution. But while Turkey is so essential and so accommodating to Europe on this issue, not being able to open the chapter on energy in our negotiations with the EU is a shame. The issue of Cyprus, a beautiful sunbathed island in the Mediterranean without any energy problems of its own, is hijacking the energy interests of 500 million Europeans. This is not fair.</p><h4>What would you like European business leaders and politicians to know about the opportunities an EU-integrated Turkey can offer?</h4><p>I strongly believe that Turkey's accession to the EU will provide a series of opportunities for businesses and consumers. The business sector will gain access to the dynamism of the Turkish economy, enhanced competition, and an expanded market. Hold on tight European investors, your Turkish friends are coming to cooperate with you!</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Kuwait has always had a strong and very close relationship with Turkey—culturally, socially and politically. Since 2005, this relationship was further strengthened through closer economic ties when the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) significantly increased its investments in Turkey.<br></p><p>Turkey has always been on the radar of the KIA, and we have owned a stake in the Arab Turkish Bank since 1975. Turkey, with a population of more than 75 million straddling one of the world's busiest sea-lanes across two continents, is expected to play a greater global role economically and financially. This is further supported by Turkish demographics—more than 25% of the population is 14 years or younger.</p><p>In 2005, the KIA undertook a comprehensive review of its Strategic Asset Allocation, and Turkey was identified as one of the countries with significant potential—especially in its financial sector, which includes banks, financial services, and insurance companies. Financial institutions were a natural choice as banks invariably act as a proxy for the economic growth of a country, and Turkey is no exception. A part of the KIA's review process included a comparative analysis between those economies expected to grow at low single digits versus those emerging markets with high growth expectations. Turkey is a dynamic country that, other than in 2009, has continued to grow spectacularly.</p><p>In addition to the financial sector, the other sectors that the KIA has considered for investments in Turkey include real estate, infrastructure, and consumer-related businesses.</p><p>This confidence in Turkey's potential was validated by the resilience shown by the Turkish economy during the recent financial crisis of 2008-2009, which impacted the global economy badly. While most of the leading global financial institutions were severely impacted in the storm of the Great Recession of 2008/09, Turkish financial institutions emerged stronger and healthier from this crisis. Turkish sovereign credit was also rewarded for its reforms, and its credit rating was actually increased from C in 2005 to B/BB in 2010. In fact, statistics show that capital inflows into Turkey increased over the past few years, which is another vote of confidence by the international financial community in Turkey's economic policies and its openness in encouraging foreign direct capital investments.</p><p>I believe that the term BRICs, indicating high growth emerging economies, should be renamed as BRITCs, since Turkey is going to be an indisputable contributor to global economic growth in the coming decades.</p><p>During the financial crisis, the KIA saw increased investment opportunities where we were able to participate in the share capital of some of the leading Turkish institutions as well as acquire prime real estate in Istanbul, a leading international city with a population of more than 12 million representing nearly 17% of Turkey's total population.</p><p>From a low exposure in Turkey in 2005, the KIA increased its participation in leading blue-chip listed Turkish entities through different external fund managers. Simultaneously investing in the shares of listed entities on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, the KIA also took direct stakes in the financial and real estate sectors. The KIA's investments in Turkey, over only a few years, increased by various multiples into hundreds of millions of US dollars. This was due to significant fresh funds allocated to Turkey as well as the organic growth of the KIA's investments. As an example, one of our investments in a financial institution has more than tripled in value in less than three years</p><p>The KIA believes in Turkey. We believe in the future of Turkey. Turkey has numerous well-known advantages, and the KIA has identified several factors that we are confident will continue to help Turkey prosper:</p><p>•Turkey has one of the most well regulated, highly capitalized, and extremely efficient banking sectors globally.</p><p>•Turkey has undertaken a series of economic reforms that have helped the country face the current, as well as expected, crises with greater resilience than most of its neighbors.</p><p>•Turkey has a highly vibrant economic environment with a history of entrepreneurship and business interests regionally as well as globally.</p><p>•It has an active private sector with professional managers who have proven themselves in good and bad times.</p><p>•Turkey has unparalleled natural geographic comparative advantages with a mobile and literate young population who are comfortable in the West as well as in the East.</p><p>•Turkey's ongoing reforms with the goal of becoming a member of the EU.</p><p>The KIA will continue to invest in Turkey in those sectors, industries, and companies where the investment opportunities are attractive—and if the price is right.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Around one-half of Turkey's installed generating capacity has been supplied by Alstom. What is behind the company's strong presence here?</h4><p>When you examine the installed base capacity in Turkey, we have a huge presence. You can find key components supplied by Alstom over the last 60 years in more than 50% of Turkey's generating facilities. When you look at our market share in hydropower, we are the leader in equipment and supply. You can also find key components supplied by Alstom in most coal-fired plants in Turkey. Those have been the main sources of energy dominating Turkish power generation and we are leading in these fields. The coal-fired facilities are now aging and need updating, and we will play a central role in this process.</p><h4>Moving into the future, what are Alstom's main targets?</h4><p>We will remain big in the fields I have mentioned, but we have also recently moved into wind power as well and signed our first wind contract in Turkey. We have considerable targets for wind as we have for hydro. Turkey's target is to have 20,000 MW of wind power by 2023 and we are planning to take a measured share  of this.</p><h4>What is the current level of development in the renewable energy sector locally?</h4><p>I think Turkey is on the right track. When you look at the installed basis on the generation side, more than 50% comes from combined-cycle facilities. The government is trying to diversify supply sources and is supporting hydro, wind, geothermal, and solar energy generation.</p><h4>Can renewable energy sources play a realistic role in reducing Turkey's reliance on imported energy over the medium term?</h4><p>In the medium term yes, but in the long term I believe that with the growth of Turkey they are not the main solution. We will have to turn to nuclear energy. Turkey has to have a portfolio with a diverse range of generation facilities from gas to nuclear and all kinds of renewables. We cannot focus on one source and escape from the others—it is simply not sustainable.</p><h4>Does Alstom hope to participate in the future development of a nuclear power facility in Turkey?</h4><p>We are active in almost all projects. The government seems determined to sign a bilateral project with a foreign country, whether it be the Russians or the Koreans or another. We are currently not engaged in any talks to supply any specific project. We are following the negotiations closely and we will see if there is any opportunity for us or not.</p><h4>How has the sell-off and liberalization of the Turkish generation and distribution grid helped in creating interest for your power generator products?</h4><p>Privatization and liberalization are some of the main drivers in the market for us. It creates a market for equipment, as the new owner of a distribution grid wants to have their own equipment to generate and sell electricity to their consumers.</p><h4>A deal was signed recently with Enerjisa to provide equipment for the Arkun hydropower plant. How significant was this contract?</h4><p>It was highly significant for us and it was the second contract we have signed with this customer. Two years ago we made a three-project deal for 450 MW of generating facilities, and having this new deal shows the satisfaction of our client and the success of our equipment. We faced all the major players in the market on this bid, but the fantastic execution of our first contract really gave us the edge. Enerjisa is a strong private energy company. We have also worked with Sanko, Limak, and Bilgin, and continue to be a number one choice for many other private energy companies.</p><h4>Where do you anticipate the most growth in the Turkish energy sector over the short term?</h4><p>We predict another boom in the natural gas sector; hydropower will continue strongly like it has over the last five years. Wind will also see acceleration. We believe that we have the edge in the combined-cycle sector due to the technology we possess in sequential combustion. Our plan is also to have a measured share of the gas-fired market in the coming years, though this is a highly competitive area with companies such as Siemens involved. The government's energy policy and strategy paper for 2023 shows that the target is to have a diverse range of energy resources. However, in the long term I believe gas will continue to play a major role in the future of Turkish energy.</p><h4>How do you expect to see Turkish energy consumption figures change in the coming years?</h4><p>According to our research, growth is between 5% and 7% on an annual basis. When you look at the last 25 years you see that it averages around 6.5% and 7%, and this will continue. GDP is increasing along much the same lines.</p><h4>How does Turkey fit into Alstom's worldwide plans?</h4><p>We are benefitting from Turkey's unique situation as a country with a rapidly developing economy and a young population. We have 1,000 people working for Alstom in Turkey and we are active in all sectors of the energy market. Alstom has its largest transformer factory in Gebze, and Turkey is among our top 15 countries in terms of investment.</p><h4>Is it realistic to expect that Turkey will no longer be a net importer of energy?</h4><p>Even if we consider that nuclear energy will begin to play a role in the 2020s, without the discovery of major new oil or gas resources within Turkey I see no possibility that the country can be self-sufficient in energy terms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In accordance with your industrial strategy for 2011-2014, how is the government supporting industrial R&amp;D activities in both the public and private sectors?</h4><p>We give great importance to industrial research and development activities in both sectors. In fact, the Turkish Industrial Strategy Document 2011-2014: “Towards EU Membership", which was approved on December 7, 2010 by the High Planning Council, consists of eight horizontal industrial policy areas. The “Technological Development of Companies" is one of these eight areas. The action plan of the document consists of 72 action points, 20 of which are on the technological development of companies in the field of horizontal industrial policy. This by itself shows the importance given to this topic.</p><p>I believe that, in the coming years, innovation and improvements in technological infrastructure should form the basis for competitiveness policies. In accordance, the weight of high-tech industries and the value-added of traditional industries must be augmented. In turn, this requires the further development of R&amp;D and innovation activities. Accordingly, the private sector must engage in R&amp;D, and R&amp;D support must be implemented. The activities of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) must be expanded, information and communication technologies must be used more efficiently, and industrial and intellectual property rights must be protected.</p><p>In this respect, many initiatives have been undertaken recently to emphasize the role of innovation in competitiveness, including R&amp;D support laws, tax incentive and exemption laws, techno-venture capital support, technology center operations, and technology development regions. Estimates indicate that the resources set aside through R&amp;D support legislation in Turkey will reach 2% of GDP by 2013.</p><h4>What role should a credit guarantee system play in financing SMEs for industrial activities?</h4><p>Competitiveness has become more intense due to technological developments, rapid communications, and globalization, along with the economic stagnation witnessed all around the world. In this highly competitive environment, it is necessary to assist SMEs for them to survive, to increase their competitive power, make them follow new developments, and plan their activities. In the meantime, developing new mechanisms to create new entrepreneurs or strengthen and diversify the ongoing mechanisms also bears great importance.</p><p>High quality levels and standardization are the necessary ingredients for competitiveness. In order to satisfy this requirement, it is essential to closely follow changing technologies and high technology investments. On the other hand, investments further increase the requirement for the long-term financing of SMEs, which usually depend on equity capital. For this reason, it is of great importance to boost alternative financing mechanisms for SMEs and other corporations, especially for those operating in the manufacturing sector.</p><p>The high value and quality guarantees demanded from SMEs by the finance sector, especially for long-term investment credit, is probably one of the most difficult requirements to meet because the outcome of guarantee terms can hinder investments or postpone them for a long time. This may result in the postponement of desired targets regarding quality and production increases and lead to market loss due to the impairment of competitive power. Now, at this point, meeting the voluminous high-quality guarantee requirements of SMEs in long-term investment credits via credit guarantee establishments is considered to be one of the most crucial steps towards the provision of appropriate conditions for investment in our SME sector. In this manner, the existence of a credit guarantee system, in an environment in which financial institutions abstain from providing credit, is vitally important in delivering guarantees to new entrepreneurs and R&amp;D based corporations, and in providing long-term investment, for which high-value guarantees are required.</p><p>In this context, we realize the importance of the Credit Guarantee Fund, which is unique in its field, and an affiliate organization of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB). In the last three years, great effort has been made to develop the company. Huge resources have been allocated to the Credit Guarantee Fund and its capital was increased to TL240 million in 2009. The Credit Guarantee Fund has extended its operations to 24 provinces, and the number of its branches has increased to 26. In the meantime, the number of financial institutions the fund has cooperated with reached 37.</p><h4>The automotive sector is one of Turkey's fastest growing industries. In your view, how important is domestic demand in fueling this growth, and how important is the development of exports?</h4><p>The automotive sector has a strategic value for our country, and I think that domestic and foreign demand are both important ingredients with respect to the sector's growth potential here. The vast majority of companies serving the automotive industry in Turkey are manufacturing in global markets under license and in partnership with global automotive companies. However, in respect to the number of cars per capita, our country is still an unsaturated market. A positive course of economic development, growth of per capita income, and the presence of a large young population are the reasons behind this flourishing market. In addition, particularly with the harmonization of EU technical legislation, the quality of manufactured products and production capability started displaying significant improvements, and in doing so the EU market has become the largest export market for Turkey. Thus, with the increase in the global integration of our country, Turkey has managed to become the production base of many important brands. This process has provided the establishment of an important production culture within the country since the 1960s. Furthermore, our country's geographical closeness to the Balkans, Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa also means new export potentials for Turkey. Both the presence of the existing domestic market and EU markets as well as the emerging markets are expected to have a positive effect on production.</p><h4>You have called for the creation of a Turkish automotive brand. What would this step mean for Turkey and its industrial base?</h4><p>Yes, we are highly focused on this important issue, and we believe in ourselves. Currently, endeavors are being made to access global markets, and to ensure the direct introduction of Turkish-branded vehicles to the domestic market. This issue is in particular emphasized in the “Automotive Sector Strategy Paper". In this context, “National Focal Projects" will be supported.</p><h4>What potential would such a brand have in the global automotive market?</h4><p>I believe that a local vehicle brand will be successful both in the domestic market and in the global marketplace. The vehicle should be in compliance with international technical regulations and be able to reach a comprehensive qualified consumer group. For this reason, the electric vehicle category, which is developing quickly across the globe, seems to be an appropriate choice at the moment. In addition, in terms of supporting the use of such vehicles, a series of measures will be implemented.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fair Play]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fair-play]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your background in the fair hosting industry?</h4><p>I graduated from the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Middle East Technical University in 1985. I was the managing director of a private company for eight years before joining CNR in 1994. Since then I have worked for CNR in various positions and took up the CEO position for the second time in mid-2010 after a break from the company. The trade show business was just emerging when I joined in 1994, and so I am lucky to have seen firsthand the growth and change in the industry.</p><h4>How is the expansion of your fair facilities progressing?</h4><p>Four new halls with a capacity of 40,000 square meters were opened in May 2011 during the Evtex Home Textile Show. Altogether there will be 14 halls with a total of 150,000 square meters of exhibition space.</p><p>When I joined the company there was only one hall with 10,000 square meters in capacity. Development has been fast as we have had to expand to meet demand. The additional space under construction will be sufficient for the next five years, and then after that we will expand this facility further. There are no other options other than CNR to host events on this scale in Istanbul. We will continue to develop this facility as Istanbul is the one and only destination for trade and commerce shows in Turkey.</p><h4>How many fairs does CNR hold annually, and how will the opening of halls 12-15 improve your ability to host events?</h4><p>In 2010 we held 54 shows; less than one-third of these were third-party exhibition organizers. We will use the new halls for the expansion of existing large shows such as the home textiles, furniture, auto, and machine tools shows. With the remaining space we will develop new projects.</p><h4>With Turkey positioned between huge markets in Asia, Europe, and Africa, what percentage of participants are foreign?</h4><p>Foreign exhibitors can attend directly or indirectly. Indirect foreign representation through local Turkish companies constitutes around half of all our attendees. Direct foreign representation represents around 15% of exhibitors. Direct exhibitors tend to work independently for a couple of years before finding a local agent,  and they then continue their presence indirectly.</p><h4>The recent autoshow was opened by Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Çağlayan. Is this a good indicator of the interest of foreign auto manufacturers in the Turkish market?</h4><p>Yes, our autoshow is one of the Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) accredited shows. If OICA backs a show it means that the main companies assume the role of exhibitors, not their local distributors. This means they launch new models here and display prototypes. Less than 10 shows are OICA branded around the world. Minister Cağlayan was here because automobiles are the number one Turkish export.</p><p>The local demand for passenger cars has also boomed following the crisis. In 2010 750,000 cars were sold in Turkey, which is an all-time record. The number of attendees increased 40% to 800,000 from the previous show. We also welcomed Chinese manufacturer Geely for the first time.</p><h4>How do fairs like the autoshow benefit the economy?</h4><p>The autoshow is different from other exhibitions as it is public orientated. Most shows are business-to-business or business-to-consumer trade shows. These shows give an indication of the level of demand in an industry.</p><p>The success of a show indicates that positive things are happening, and trade shows are useful in overcoming the psychological effects of a crisis. Just being part of a large exhibition is important for a company to show its strength. The government knows this and that is why we see keen government interest in our shows.</p><h4>What makes exhibitions such an effective way for foreign companies to show off their products?</h4><p>They are very useful for newcomers. At a trade show all members of a sector come together under one roof, and this eliminates a company's need to conduct research. It facilitates networking and promotes all the players in a sector. We have the opportunity to transform Istanbul into one of the main centers for trade shows. International companies keep coming to Turkey and we will see this reflected in the exhibition business. I believe that Istanbul will become one of main exhibition centers, alongside Europe and China.</p><h4>How have you seen foreign interest in Turkish markets increase over your time at CNR?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years there has been increased interest and demand for our exhibitions. Around half of all foreign Turkish trade is now with neighboring countries. As relations have improved in the region, Turkey has become a regional hub, and that's why so many people from areas like the Middle East come to our shows. This has been the main driver of our business over the crisis period as demand from Europe and the US dropped dramatically.</p><h4>You are a member of The Union of International Fairs (UFI). How has this benefitted your company?</h4><p>The UFI is a source of information and experience that brings together leading worldwide fair companies. It tells exhibitors that we have met the international requirements to host a show. It has been useful in promoting our shows to companies that may not have known about us.</p><h4>What exciting fairs have you got coming up in 2011?</h4><p>Our most exciting upcoming show is on construction materials, and it is the first time they will organize a show of this kind. We are also looking forward to hosting large ICT and consumer electronics shows.</p><h4>What has been your personal favorite annual fair?</h4><p>The home textiles fair is my favorite, as more than one-third of attendees are international. Some 15,000 international buyers attend, making it the largest by size and number of exhibiting companies. It is the second largest home textile show in the world after Frankfurt. This is CNR's biggest success story. We are also hoping to have a huge ICT show in 2012. This is a sector that will shape the future and CNR will play an important role.</p><h4>The World Fair must be every fair organizers dream. Is there a chance Turkey will host one in the future?</h4><p>The World Fair is my dream. I am the one who personally presented the idea to businesses and NGOs in Turkey 15 years ago. My dream was to bring it to Istanbul, but Izmir applied to host the event. Unfortunately, the city lost out to Milan. However, there is still a chance for 2020; it might be my retirement project.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the price of steel affected over the crisis period, and what are your expectations for 2011?</h4><p>Just before the global economic crisis steel prices increased considerably, and tonnage base prices came to around $1,500. During the crisis prices decreased sharply over two months from $1,500 to $400. At that time it was difficult to establish an acceptable balance between cost and price. Most companies tried to eliminate inputs in their stocks because the prices were even higher than output prices. In 2010, more balanced conditions were established and the world steel industry began to be profitable again. However, it isn't possible to say profit margins were comparable to pre-crisis levels in 2010. The margins were also not enough to compensate for the losses some companies made over the challenging period of the crisis. In 2010, the basic barrier to establishing more profitable conditions was excess global capacity. Worldwide consumption in 2010 was 1.4 billion tons, with capacity at around 1.9 billion tons. In the coming years we are expecting the large gap between consumption and capacity to disappear as consumption continues to increase and old technology is phased out; this will promote better balance conditions, and work to improve steel prices.</p><h4>Turkey is an increasingly important exporter of iron and steel products, and is also seeing a lot of domestic demand. What role does domestic demand play in the development of the iron and steel industry in Turkey?</h4><p>In 2010, fulfilling domestic demand played a bigger role than exports did. Exports decreased around 9%. Even under these conditions, the export level was not negligible, hovering at around the 14-million-ton level. Turkey's production also increased 15.2%. We are very quickly returning to pre-crisis levels. The per capita consumption of finished steel during the crisis year of 2009 declined to 249 kilograms from the 300-kilogram level seen in 2008. Turkey's per capita finished crude steel consumption rose to 320 kilograms in 2010, and in the coming years we may pass the 400-kilogram per capita finished steel consumption level very quickly considering the stable growth rates in the country. The stability of the government and public investments will also support these developments. The economy performed well in 2010, with the growth rate reaching 8.9%, which was the highest GDP growth rate in the OECD and EU countries and third in the G-20. For 2011-2012 expectations are different, but the most modest expectations are around 4%. We expect, however, to see 6%. Growth in the Turkish steel sector will be around 15%, and exports will grow around 15%. This is partly related to domestic demand and to new capacities. In 2010 local companies increased domestic melting capacity by 4.9 million tons, which is expected to rise a further 3.7 million tons in 2011. We will see further capacity growth over the next five years time, a tendency supported by growing domestic demand.</p><h4>Do you see room for foreign investors to enter the Turkish steel industry?</h4><p>There are gaps in the industry for some types of quality steel related to the automotive sector and in stainless steel. Turkey is politically stable and this is supporting the dynamism of the economy, particularly the iron and steel industry. When a company plans to invest in Turkey, it should consider the potential demand level and not only the current demand level.</p><h4>When do you expect Turkey to be self-sufficient in flat steel?</h4><p>The base figures show that we will reach this target by 2013. However, knowing what will happen when we hit our targets is difficult, as it is hard to estimate the ever-increasing consumption levels. If we look at the figures, we are increasing our production level; however, consumption is also increasing at the same level making it difficult to close the gap. For this reason there may be the need for additional investment. Some companies will export, and imports will continue. If this stays around the same level, then production will continue to follow and match consumption levels.</p><h4>In terms of exports, which markets are the most important, and how has that changed in recent years?</h4><p>In the old days the EU market was more attractive to us. As conditions changed, the Turkish market became more attractive to the Europeans. When we had previously increased our exports to EU countries, EU steel producers started to make complaints and request protective measures. Total steel exports from the EU zone to Turkey in 2010 were around four times higher than Turkey's steel exports to the EU in terms of value. Turkish steel producers have also managed to increase their steel exports to the US market in 2010 after the sharp drop in 2009. However, nowadays our main export destinations are neighboring countries such as Iraq, Syria, Israel, and Iran. We expect that some African countries will be good markets for us too depending on price conditions. In relation to our future involvement in EU markets, we hope to become more competitive again when the effects of the crisis fade and it becomes easier to compete in terms of price.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the success of the Regional Mining, Metals, and Minerals Summit held in Istanbul in January 2011?</h4><p>There were lots of participants from regional countries. Such events are crucial in order for relations to be established between different companies from the region. The summit allowed potential investors to understand market conditions and make more realistic business decisions. We hope that it will result in significant investments coming to Turkey.</p><h4>You have highlighted Turkey as a diverse and strong economy. What are the country's competitive economic advantages?</h4><p>The basic advantage is its geographic position. Turkey is in the middle of the emerging economies. The countries in our region, particularly North Africa, saw continued growth during the crisis period. These markets allowed the Turkish steel industry to compensate for its losses elsewhere, and opened up new export opportunities for local companies. The Turkish economy provides good conditions for investors also, as well as access to the EU and to neighboring economies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has Toyota's strategy been since the global economic crisis in Turkey?</h4><p>Toyota is export-orientated in Turkey. In 2006 we reached a production capacity of 270,000 units, and 95% of that production was for export. This made Toyota Turkey's top exporter for that year, with a total export value of $2.5 billion. The recent global economic crisis affected the entire industry, yet the recovery has been fast, and the current climate is even better than before the crisis; 2010 was a glittering year for the automotive sector in Turkey. All manufacturers made significant improvements in terms of production and export. This reflects the lack of crisis conditions in Turkey. Currently, Toyota in Turkey is focusing on Europe as the firm lost an important market share there during the crisis. Toyota's total global number of sales before the crisis was 8.9 million, and now it is around 8.5 million, with this 400,000 difference stemming from the drop in business seen in Europe. So, aside from Europe, the crisis recovery is complete, and that is why we are focusing on European exports at the moment. We are also focusing on strengthening our foundations. Certainly, Toyota Turkey is a quite strong and institutionalized company. Crisis means opportunity for us and it's a chance to develop our basics such as quality, productivity, and safety. I am more confident that Toyota Turkey will recover very soon.</p><h4>Why has Turkey's production base recovered so quickly following the crisis?</h4><p>Turkey has a young population, and it is a big market. Education levels are strong in Turkey, and this puts us in a good position. Toyota Turkey is no doubt the leader of all European Toyota plants, and in my own opinion we are in another league. We are also competing to be among the best branches of Toyota globally. This condition exists for other automotive manufacturers in Turkey also. Renault Turkey is the star within its group, and the same applies to Ford and Fiat. Renault has made significant investments in Turkey, and this is partly due to the ease with which qualified, experienced, and ambitious workers can be found. These factors have meant that greater efficiencies can be achieved here, and the differences are stark.</p><h4>What significance does Toyota attach to Turkey's human resource potential globally?</h4><p>The strengths of the Turkish workforce are very well known to Toyota global. There are around 100 Turkish engineers working in Brussels at the European headquarters. I was the first Turk to go there in 2002, and I worked there for six years as Vice-President. Now there are Turkish workers at all levels there. This is very much appreciated by the head office in Japan, and I have heard that those engineers are considered to be as good as Japanese engineers.</p><h4>What was behind the decision to manufacture the new Corolla here in Turkey?</h4><p>We will produce 95,000 vehicles of this model in 2011. Our total capacity is closer to 170,000. In reality, with very negligible investment we can bring this capacity up to over 200,000. The background of this decision was to bring volume to this company. With the existing models we will approach our capacity in terms of production. Later, at the end of the lifetime of the current models, we will try to convince the decision makers in Japan to bring in one more big volume model. If we obtain such a model, we will exceed 200,000. The decision to bring Corolla production here was simply to utilize the production capabilities of this company and to increase volumes.</p><h4>A couple of years ago ALJ Group partnered with Toyota. What has been the impact of that?</h4><p>ALJ Group is a distributor in several regions, including North Africa and the Middle East. There are also some dealerships in Europe. In 2009 the group purchased 65% of Toyota's distributor company for $80 million. After this purchase, there was a pickup in terms of motivation. It became very positive for the Turkish market, and sales increased to 40,000 in Turkey over a year—the first time such figures had been seen. We support ALJ in all kinds of activities. If there is a need for a special kind of product in the Turkish market then we cooperate in every way that we can. ALJ utilizes unique priorities and has a fantastic perception of the market. With ALJ, because it is a big global Toyota partner, its priority is the Toyota brand. We also share deep mutual respect with the group's management, and this helps facilitate a fruitful business relationship.</p><h4>You have discussed what makes Toyota unique as a corporation. What can you tell us about the Toyota production system and its advantages?</h4><p>One of Toyota's biggest advantages is its production system. The company has 300,000 employees worldwide, and most of them are involved in production. Management is also very influential, but the real power of the company lies in its production. Our production system is very lean. There is no excess, and yet there is nothing missing in terms of the devices and components required for production. In the Toyota production system, such an understanding of the lean attitude is key to its efficiency. Intelligent automation is also important. This means that total quality must be attained in every component of a car. Each employee has the ability to bring production to a halt if he or she has concerns. We can check the number of times the line has been stopped, and how many minutes were lost in getting things operational again. However, we never discourage employees from halting the line. There are also automatic quality controls should a mistake be made. We operate on a just-in-time basis right across the board from production to delivery. We have eight shipments a day from our suppliers, and whenever equipment is required that exact quantity is supplied immediately. This improves overall efficiency. In this facility, we have around 2,800 employees on average. There are also around 200-300 contractors dealing with cleaning and so forth. Around peak production time there are around 4,200 employees. During off-peak production times, our production is reduced by half, yet our head count does not drop as significantly. This is because of fixed elements and the respect principle we have. We will not let people go unnecessarily unless the company is approaching bankruptcy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish automotive industry, for Toyota, and for the economy in general?</h4><p>I am very optimistic about the Turkish economy. So far, my biggest criticism was due to the exchange rate conditions. This has reduced competitiveness in the export market. At the beginning of 2011, however, policy change was implemented. This reform was vital due to the balance of payments and the current account deficit. This is the weakest aspect of the economy, and the issue has been recognized by the government and the Central Bank of Turkey. We are pleased to see measures being taken to combat it. I therefore expect Turkey to grow well over the coming years. The Turkish desire to be successful is very high, whether it be within larger corporations or through entrepreneurship. So far, in the automotive industry, the large companies have almost reached saturation in terms of capacity. There are some business improvements and enlargement activities, and Fiat is very active in this area. We will also increase our production as we have excess capacity. The further potential is in new investments. We expect to see newcomers such as Peugeot and other European brands. Some Chinese brands may also appear in Turkey. Investing in Turkey is the right decision due to the many reasons I have mentioned. Turkey is an excellent center of automotive production. There is a strong supplier base, and we have an 80% localization rate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Domestic demand is driving the economy. How would you assess retail demand locally, and how important is Turkey for Procter &amp; Gamble's operations globally?</h4><p>Turkey has been growing consistently for the last decade, and growth has also been good in the categories in which P&amp;G competes, such as household cleaning and beauty products like detergents, diapers, paper towels, and so forth. The oral care sector has a lot of room to expand in Turkey, which is even less developed than in Kazakhstan. The beauty sector is very dynamic because it's also underdeveloped in Turkey compared to developed countries. We benchmark BRIC countries, and Turkey usually comes in just after these four countries. Turkey is the 16th largest economy in the world and it is growing fast, so it's the focus of attention for a lot of companies and investors. Naturally it's also one of the top markets for Procter &amp; Gamble. Our markets and portfolio offerings have grown consistently since 2001. When you look at the Turkish economy in general, growth has been in the single digits for the last three or four years, but it's still one of the fastest growing countries in the world. The population is young and growing, with an expanding labor force. GDP is also growing, and there are around 200,000 new households a year. Investments are also strong, with most major multinationals now operating in Turkey, including Procter &amp; Gamble. We have our own production facilities here too from which we not only supply local demand, but also demand from the countries around us in the region—and we even export to Europe. When you look at all those factors, you can understand why Procter &amp; Gamble is in Turkey. We are committed to portfolio expansion here, and have been in the country for 15 years. Things look positive for the future.</p><h4>You have your own manufacturing unit here in Turkey, and people often talk about the advantages of producing and manufacturing goods here. How would you rate Turkey as a production base?</h4><p>When you look at regional countries, Turkey is the biggest market alongside Russia. However, Turkey has to be careful about cost competitiveness. This country is not the cheapest in terms of cost. Turkish labor costs have become quite high, especially in developed areas like Istanbul and Izmir. Secondly, there are a lot of indirect taxes on production, especially on electricity, fuel, communications, transport, and so on. These factors increase production costs, too. Yes, Turkey is a big and important market, but P&amp;G Turkey's cost structure isn't the most competitive over other countries. Countries like Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and even Egypt have an advantage in that sense. Another important factor is education and training. We have very good universities, but we need better technicians and technical schools. University education is very important, but technical education is also crucial. There are sectors in which Turkey has excelled in creating a well-trained labor force like in the automotive industry in areas like Bursa. However, we need better, expert, qualified labor in all fields. Turkey will never be as cheap as certain other countries, but we can make up for that disadvantage by having better and more qualified technicians and a more educated and well-trained labor force. The unregistered economy is also an issue. Turkey has to focus on the equality of taxes, and there must be a base for equal treatment in that regard. Today, registered companies pay taxes, leaving half of the economy exempt. These companies need to be offered incentives to register, and begin a process of investing in people.</p><h4>In terms of the beauty segment, what brands and products perform well?</h4><p>Certain categories of beauty products are very developed, like say, shampoos and hair care products. Procter &amp; Gamble's Pantene Head &amp; Shoulders, for example, was launched a few years ago and it has become very successful. Hair dyes also do well, not just for older people but also younger people. Facial products are also doing well, such as soaps, skin creams, gels, liquids, and the like.</p><h4>Brand management has been one of the hallmarks of Procter &amp; Gamble's success. Can you tell us more about that?</h4><p>Brand management has been at the core of our business since the 1960s. It is Procter &amp; Gamble's job to create global brands. The company has one of the biggest portfolios globally, and as a mass marketer, Procter &amp; Gamble's philosophy is to offer high-quality global brands at a reasonable cost. Approximately 95% of households in Turkey contain at least one Procter &amp; Gamble brand. Procter &amp; Gamble's sales totaled about $80 billion in 2010. The company has 24 “billion-dollar brands", meaning a brand that exceeds $1 billion in sales annually. Those brands are part of a group of 50 leadership brands that are among the world's best known household names. These 50 brands make up 90% of P&amp;G's sales. This is a good display of Procter &amp; Gamble's focus—to create global brands. We want to market all of these global brands here in Turkey, and the last three big entries we made were for Olay, Head &amp; Shoulders, and Fairy.</p><h4>How do you make sure your brands aren't competing against each other?</h4><p>We target consumers based on their needs. For example, Ariel is the best detergent on the market with the latest technology and it appeals to those consumers who want to spend a little more to have the best stain remover around. On the other hand, our Alo brand is cheaper and appeals to a different type of consumer. We find the best solution is to develop and market brands that appeal to particular consumer needs.</p><h4>How significant are Procter &amp; Gamble's corporate social responsibility projects?</h4><p>In line with our global “Live, Learn and Thrive" project, we contribute to the society in which we live and work, with a particular focus on children and education. Our social responsibility projects are a mutual part of P&amp;G's sustainability approach to touch and improve lives for today and generations to come. To give you an example, we've been educating young girls on how to deal with feminine hygiene, how to use certain products, how to take care of their bodies, how to lead healthy lives, and share then their knowledge and experience. We've reached over 12 million teenagers in the last 17 years. Also, for the last seven years we've worked with Migros on the Special Olympics to build up capability and self-confidence through sports, reaching 4,000 handicapped sportsmen and women. Within our flagship project, “Dream to Reality", in cooperation with Darüşşafaka, we have reached over 10,000 students in one year through projects in science, photography, and music. We also worked on the tetanus vaccination campaign with UNICEF on a worldwide scale, and also in Turkey, where 100 million vaccines have been provided. We also address disasters like the recent tragedy in Japan and elsewhere. We're very active.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently acquired the Italian flexible packaging company Nuroll. How does this acquisition reflect your growth strategy?</h4><p>We wanted to become a full-range supplier. Our strategy is to buy the technology, know-how, and market instead of developing them. This allows us to run a smooth business operation without any added obstacles along the way. Italy is one of the centers for innovation in packaging, and the opportunity presented itself in the form of Italian company Nuroll.</p><p>Nuroll is very experienced in Biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (BOPET). The packaging consumption rate per capita in Turkey is only $85 per person, and the world average is $130. In North America and Canada this number is as high as $400, and Japan it is $550. This means we have a long way to go, and that the Turkish market is far from being at saturation point. We are aiming to develop Turkey in this area. We acquired Nuroll to reach these targets, and chose the company as it is one of the only companies in Europe producing BOPET. We will keep Nuroll in Italy producing specialty products, while Polinas will focus on the commodities.</p><h4>What expansion opportunities came about with the acquisition of Nuroll?</h4><p>In the planning stages of acquiring Nuroll we knew we would have to make follow up investments, and so now we are investing in Nuroll's technology. We are also investing in a new plant very close to Polinas' facilities in Manisa. This will be a new line producing 30,000 tons of BOPET per year. Nuroll's capacity is only 20,000 tons and contains an extra two lines. We will transfer the technology from Nuroll to this new production facility. Hopefully, this facility will start up in January 2012. With these investments complete, the packaging group will have a yearly BOPET capacity of 50,000 tons, and a biaxially-orientated polypropylene (BOPP) capacity of 100,000 tons. This puts us in a strong position in the European league and the world league—at least in the top 10. The major driving force behind these acquisitions is the fact that Turkey is becoming a production center in Europe. If European clients place an order with us, they will receive it within a week; this is not possible from other countries, including China.</p><h4>How much of your production is for the export market?</h4><p>Currently we export 35-40% of our production mainly to European countries. For every 100 units of exports, 80% are sent  to Europe.</p><h4>What sort of a range of products do you offer your clients?</h4><p>Our biggest volume goes to clients producing chocolates, biscuits, cakes, and beverages. Besides packaging, our  products find application in the electronics and photovoltaic (solar) industries—and these are areas we are looking to move further into, and produce mainly in Italy. We will shift volumes for commodities over to Turkey, while the technological films will be made over in Italy.</p><h4>What steps has Polinas taken to make plastics more environmentally friendly?</h4><p>What to do with plastics is an environmental question being asked around the world. People carry out a lot of campaigns against plastics, but these protests are unrealistic. Plastic brings comfort to the lives of people. Without plastics life would become very difficult, and it wouldn't be possible to provide the same storage capabilities. Therefore, instead of trying to get rid of plastics from our lives we have to find out how to avoid the negative consequences of their use. In the world, paper is the most recycled material, the second is metal, the third is plastic, and the fourth is glass. Only an insignificant part of packaging material can be recycled. To package 6,000 chocolate bars you need only one kilogram of film. Therefore, it is not possible to go through the recycling process and classify the packaging as garbage. So, we must use biodegradable plastics. But when you use these products there are costs as well.</p><p>One biodegradable option is polylactic acid (PLA), which is derived from corn. This is really something difficult to believe in because a lot of people in the world are hungry; they need food, and corn is a food staple. It is ridiculous to use corn for packaging purposes, and it is expensive. Therefore, we have developed a synthetic-based biodegradable material. A petroleum derivative is still used as a raw material, but some extra additives are added to make the films degrade over time. We started rolling out this product in 2007. We have a good product, but unfortunately we cannot sell it as we would like because there is no legislation supporting its use. Even in the most developed countries in the world—in the UK for example—there is no legislation. Without legislation nobody will use these materials because the cost is 20-25% higher. We are disappointed that we have made such an investment, spending a lot of money on R&amp;D and on launching the products, but have gained only a limited amount of sales. We are one of the few companies in the world that can produce such plastics, and we are the only licensed biodegradable film producer in Turkey.</p><h4>How significant is your R&amp;D expenditure?</h4><p>Our policy is to spend up to 3% of our net sales on R&amp;D. However, when we say R&amp;D we also include all the expenditures from the purchase of technology and know-how. We do not conduct basic research on our own, as it is expensive and requires a lot of time. We perform this kind of research in cooperation with universities and other institutions.</p><h4>What competitive advantages does Polinas have being part of a large group of companies?</h4><p>We are part of Yıldız Holding, which is also the owner of Ülker Group. Ülker Group is the largest food producer in Turkey and it uses 8-9% of our total production, which is a certain advantage for us. Apart from that we can come together in R&amp;D projects, so this facilitates a lot of opportunities for us to see and plan for the future together. We also alert them to any upcoming trends or legislative changes they should be aware of. Having a big name gives us better financial resources and investment opportunities, including HR and IT capabilities.</p><h4>What is the future for Polinas and the packaging industry?</h4><p>The future is to create packaging that eliminates the need to add preservatives to food. The future is the health of human beings. To facilitate health you need an absence of chemicals, and if you don't want the chemicals then you need sophisticated packaging, which we have. Being able to supply both BOPP and BOPET together gives us economies of scale to improve our packaging for the future. We are also pioneering new logistic methods—and this is vital to our operations. We will continue to seek new ways of delivering to our customers on time whenever they need something. Having these two product lines together has given us strength to use these new models. All of this will ultimately allow us to develop the capability to design packages so advanced and cost effective that there will be no need for chemicals  in foodstuffs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much was spent on upgrading Telsim's network, and is there a need for more investment to level the network up to international standards?</h4><p>Vodafone's entrance into Turkey represents the second largest FDI in the country's history and the initial acquisition spending was only the beginning of broader long-term investment in the country. The cumulative investment made until this day, including the acquisition price, has already exceeded TL10 billion. Our intensive investment plan has been centered around one single objective: to deliver the best customer experience to our subscribers.</p><p>Right after the acquisition, we prioritized our investments to upgrade our technology infrastructure. In the last three years, we have expanded our network coverage extensively by tripling the total number of our base stations, including expansion made after the 3G launch as of mid-2009. Meanwhile, together with our trade business partners, we have also invested in an expansion of our sales and distribution capabilities, enlarging our distribution network to over 1,000 exclusive shops across Turkey and to 90% numeric distribution in the telecoms retail channel. Notably, we also made significant investments to build our brand as a trustmark in the hearts and minds of our customers.</p><h4>Since your appointment as CEO in 2009, Vodafone's market share has increased from 18.6% to 26.4%, with 16.7 million subscribers. What is behind this success?</h4><p>Back at the beginning of 2009, with strong confidence in the potential of the Turkish market, we decided to develop a new long-term strategic plan for Vodafone Turkey. This business plan was developed with a “bottom-up" approach involving the ideas and inputs of a larger group of managers in the company. The approach was instrumental in empowering our team to contribute to the strategies of the company and installing confidence to execute successful plans. We selected “customer centricity" as the primary focus of our business plan. Customer satisfaction and moreover the customer recommendation rate became the key performance indicators embraced by the whole organization.</p><p>We are pleased with our progress so far and think that our business performance is a solid indicator of the robustness of our strategic plan. Our revenue has been growing at around the 30% level over the last few quarters, making Vodafone Turkey the fastest growing operating company in the Vodafone Europe region. Our business plan has been focused on three key strategic segments where we demonstrated remarkable growth rates in 4Q 2010. Firstly, the post-paid customer base has grown by 78% on a year-on-year basis. Secondly, in enterprise segment, our revenue has grown by 49% year-on-year. Thirdly, in data, we have also registered a record growth rate of 155%. As a result, over the last eight quarters, we have increased our revenue market share by nearly 8 percentage points to a level of 26.4%. Surpassing the 25% revenue market share has been an important milestone for us.</p><h4>Was Vodafone able to take advantage in the post-mobile number portability environment?</h4><p>The introduction of mobile number portability in November 2008 marked one of the most important milestones in increasing the fairness and competitiveness in the mobile telecommunications industry. Initially, Vodafone Turkey was not off to a very good start. Our revenue trend line was actually declining. After the launch of our new customer-centric business plan, we went into a recovery period of reversing the losses. With our turnaround plan, we were able to re-gain our subscribers and consequently the revenues. Two years down the line I can say that we have successfully achieved our goal. Today, Vodafone Turkey is the undisputed leader in number portability with a net 2 million number additions since the November 2008 launch to date.</p><h4>Vodafone Turkey was among the best performing members of the entire Vodafone group during the financial crisis. What can this be attributed to?</h4><p>The Turkish economy during the global crisis did relatively better than most of the developed countries. This is partially due to the soundness of the Turkish banking sector, which has gone through a substantial reform process following the 2001 crisis, and partly also due to the adaptability and agility of the Turkish business environment. As a result of the resilience of the Turkish economy and an ambitious turnaround plan, Vodafone Turkey has succeeded in achieving remarkable growth despite the global downturn.</p><h4>What has the significance of 3G been for Vodafone?</h4><p>The 3G launch has marked another important milestone in the Turkish telecoms sector. Turkey launched 3G services later than Europe. This provided Turkey with several advantages; namely to learn from the experiences of the European operators, and benefit from the advanced network technologies in line with the advancement of mobile devices. These factors have accelerated the growth in the mobile data market post-3G launch. Turkey has a very high potential in data adoption due to its young population. Turkey ranks third in terms of Facebook usage around the world. However, PC penetration still remains low. As mobile phones transform into mini-computers, mobile internet offers a great opportunity for the future.</p><p>Vodafone Turkey has taken the launch of 3G as a strategic program to reposition itself strongly in the data space and showcase its technological and innovative capabilities. Likewise, our customers have shown great interest in our 3G products and services. Consequently, we demonstrated the fastest data growth rate, last quarter data revenue growth was at 155% year-on-year. The 3G subscription ratio in our total base has reached the 35% level, the highest ratio in the market.</p><h4>What is your Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and how does it compare to your competitors?</h4><p>Vodafone Turkey's blended ARPU reached TL17.80 in the last quarter, increasing by 24% on a year-on-year basis. Notably, we have managed to increase our ARPU in an environment in which the market average revenue per minute (ARPM) has decreased around by 30%. Our ARPU increase has largely been achieved through our “value for money" strategy, which has been an important driver of our growth. We have revamped our tariffs and focused on offering better value to our customers. Our ARPU increase is also attributable to us consolidating the usage of our subscribers at Vodafone. In other words, we have focused on increasing the activity ratio of our customers as an important indicator to leverage our ARPU in the context of declining market pricing.</p><h4>Turkey has some of the highest mobile rates in the world due to high taxation and charges. Has this held back the development of the sector?</h4><p>In terms of taxation and regulatory fees imposed on the telecoms sector, Turkey, by far, has the highest taxes and fees in the world. It is essential that these fees are reduced in order for the mobile telecoms sector to fuel the development of the economy. There is concrete evidence that the growth of mobile telecoms and mobile data usage promotes GDP growth.</p><p>In order for the telecoms industry to contribute fully to Turkey's economic growth, governmental bodies need to build on the earlier efforts where they made some reductions in mobile internet taxes. As the tax base broadens and revenues increase, the government's fiscal budget could possibly provide room for a reform and reduction in telecoms taxation and make the system fairer, simpler, and easier to administer. Reformed telecoms taxation will increase Turkey's global competitiveness and better serve Turkish consumers' mobile telecoms needs. Today, 84% of telecoms traffic comes from mobile telephony. This is an impressive ratio as there are still many countries where this ratio is below 50%. In order for us to seize the future potentials and make services available to all industries, improvements in telecoms taxation are necessary and crucial.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish economy, and what does this signal for Turkcell?</h4><p>The Turkish economy continues to distinguish itself from Europe with its strong growth recovery, healthy financial sector, and robust public debt dynamics. It has maintained its very strong performance trend, as evidenced by its growth level at 8.9% in 2010. This, coupled with improving consumer confidence, the strengthening financial position of the corporate sector, and the increasing availability of smartphones in the Turkish market, will drive growth in the mobile business in Turkey. We believe the stable macroeconomic environment and the young, tech-savvy population will also be a main driver of growth for the telecommunications sector—particularly for Turkcell. Turkcell will continue to enjoy its leading position as it covers approximately 83% of the Turkish population through its 3G and 99.07% through its 2G technology supported network. Turkcell has become one of the first among the global operators to have implemented HSDPA+ and achieved a 42.2 Mbps speed using the HSPA multi-carrier solution. Turkcell has a premium loyal customer base—31.4% of which is post-paid—and an outstanding portfolio of products and services with more than 3,000 applications in the Application Store including 24 unique Turkcell-branded applications, as well as Turkcell-branded terminal bundled offers, which all lead to increasing mobile internet revenues. We will continue to strengthen our regional leadership through our growing mobile internet business, rising group synergy, in particular through our wholly-owned subsidiary Turkcell Superonline, which provides fixed broadband services by investing in the build-up of a fiber-optic network, and the contribution of our other consolidated subsidiaries.</p><h4>How would you assess the growth potential of the mobile communications market in Turkey, and what is unique to this market relative to others in Europe?</h4><p>Turkey has the fifth largest labor force among EU countries thanks to its young population, and is the sixth largest economy in Europe. The country has a very young and dynamic market with a population of 73 million, and a low average age. People under the age of 35 represent 60% of the population, which compares well relative to European averages. With this young population, Turkey has the potential to become one of the best performing markets as consumer confidence increases. The young population is eager to use new technologies and is a key driver for the telecoms market. The Turkish telecoms market has three players, and the penetration rate is at 84% based on the authorities' 1Q 2011 report, well below the European average. The average revenue per user (ARPU) level is also quite low. One reason for this is the high tax rates present in Turkey, and there is clearly an upside to growing revenues with lower tax rates. With mobile spending as a proportion of GDP at 1.3%, similar to Europe, there is clearly potential to expand penetration rates with lower tax rates. Subscriber composition also differs from EU trends. Based on the authorities' 1Q 2011 report, in Turkey, the share of post-paid subscribers is 33%, while the EU average is 47%. As for Turkcell, the share of post-paid subscribers is around 31.4%. Unlike our peers, we do not give unlimited voice and data packages and put caps on any kinds of usage incentives that enable us to utilize our network capacity efficiently and secure our profitability levels.</p><h4>With more than 33 million subscribers, Turkcell is the leading operator in Turkey and the third biggest GSM operator in Europe. What strengths have allowed Turkcell to grow and succeed over the last 17 years?</h4><p>Including our 33.1 million Turkish subscribers, Turkcell has 60.4 million subscribers as of March 31, 2011. As a regional leader, Turkcell has operations in eight countries other than Turkey: Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Northern Cyprus, Ukraine, and Germany, and is the market leader in five. Turkcell is the number three mobile operator in Europe and number 16 in the world in terms of the number of subscribers. Turkcell has been listed on the NYSE and the ISE since 2000, and is the only NYSE-listed company in Turkey. In 2010, we maintained our market leadership in Turkey in terms of the subscriber base, share of traffic, and revenue. Revenues reached TL9 billion, yielding a net profit of TL1.8 billion and TL15.1 billion in assets. By the end of 1Q 2011, Turkcell Group had invested TL18.1 billion in its network, including 2G and 3G licenses. We are delivering total telecom solutions to our loyal customer base with a user experience of the highest level. We have differentiating value propositions, which include superior technologies, more advantages, and outstanding service quality throughout our extensive network. We are also a leader in social responsibility, setting us apart from the competition. Our commitment to the internet business through continuing investments in 3G and the fiber optic network and innovative products, services, and applications are also at the heart of our success.</p><h4>You have significant investments in several foreign countries in the region. What role do these investments play in Turkcell's overall business strategy?</h4><p>The majority of our revenues come from the Turkish market, where we are leading with a 54% subscriber market share. While we focus on our Turkish mobile business of providing voice services, data offers, and total telecoms solutions, expanding into international markets and adjacent businesses has always been an important goal for us to sustain our growth. Additionally, through our international subsidiaries, we secure the diversification of our investments.</p><p>With the recent launch of our Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) in Germany, we now operate in nine different countries. Globally, customer demand for converged and differentiated services as well as devices is growing. As part of our growth strategy, we now focus more on efficiency in our delivery of services to sustain our operating margins and grow the contribution of our international subsidiaries to Turkcell Group's consolidated financials.</p><p>We will continue to ease and enrich the lives of our customers with leading communication and technology solutions and strive to build value for our customers, stakeholders, and employees in line with our vision.</p><h4>Turkcell has been very active in European R&amp;D funding programs since 2005 and has made clear its strategy to be a technology and innovation-orientated company. What role does R&amp;D play in your vision for the future of Turkcell?</h4><p>As the leading R&amp;D and innovation center in Turkey, the technology that we've developed is transforming and facilitating the lives of more than 80 million users across 14 countries. Since inception, we have applied for 74 patents in total: 56 national and 18 international. We succeed because we are able to manage innovation by gathering the right people, turning their ideas into assets, and bringing them to market quickly and efficiently. We collaborate with global business partners, universities, and research centers and support institutions such as Eureka. Our aim is to encourage a “reverse brain drain" effect through our collaboration with international partners, ensuring that our employees see Turkey and Turkcell Technology as great places to work. We aim to develop our global footprint beyond our current geographical position. In areas such as North Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East we believe that the key areas of growth will be mobile marketing and SIM-based services such as services fuelled by Near Field Communication (NFC).</p><h4>What new products, services, and technologies do you feel are most significant at the moment, both for Turkcell and the industry in general?</h4><p>New technology platforms such as application stores for the iPhone, Palm, Nokia, Blackberry, and Android will continue to drive the market going forward—particularly in the areas of multimedia, location-based services, and augmented reality. The projects in progress that are particularly exciting include our NFC framework, and our new multimedia and location-based services. We also see an encouraging trend in the area of mobile marketing, where Turkcell has taken the lead in the mobile products and services market with its tailor-made solutions. In 2010, 1,600 mobile marketing projects were completed in 50 different sectors with 353 brands—50 of which are global. In terms of customer penetration, more than 20 million subscribers have participated in mobile marketing activities via their mobile phones since 2008. As a founding member of the Global Mobile Marketing Association, Turkcell continues to assume an active role on the association's board and its committees, supporting the efforts to increase the marketing sector's awareness of mobile marketing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey is looking to raise its annual R&amp;D expenditure to 2% of GDP. Why is this figure important for Turkey, and is the country on track to achieving it?</h4><p>If we look at the picture immediately after 2002, Turkey was only investing less than half a percent of GDP on R&amp;D. That's a low figure. The 59th and 60th government programs, and also the ninth seven-year plan released by the State Planning Organization (DPT), stressed the importance of investing in R&amp;D. As a result, we see today that this spending has increased from 0.48% to 0.84%. So it's almost doubled. But keep in mind that Turkey has also shown tremendous growth in GDP over the past few years, and in brute terms the amount of money spent on R&amp;D had actually trebled by 2005. So yes, Turkey is on track, and we are expecting to reach the 1% mark soon enough, but it's going to take some work.</p><p>Nevertheless, both the private sector and the government are committed to the 2% goal. As you know, R&amp;D is very important for both developed and developing countries. Developed countries like the US, EU, and Japan spend around 2% per year on R&amp;D. Turkey also has to attain this figure to keep up with the developed world. Also keep in mind that we have a young population. New technologies, especially ICT, are well suited to a country with a young population. Investing in R&amp;D is crucial in terms of realizing the huge youth potential that our country has. Given the right resources, we have the potential to become a true creator of technology in the near future. In the ICT area Turkey is already growing very rapidly, and that is a very positive sign.</p><h4>While Turkey is a large market with a young population, what other strengths does it have as a potential ICT hub for the region?</h4><p>Turkey's geographic location is of great importance in itself. I know it sounds clichéd, but Turkey is a bridge, not just culturally but also economically. It's a bridge in the global energy sector, with its gas and oil pipelines. It's also a transportation hub in terms of roads, airways, and railways. If you look at global R&amp;D expenditures and the number of patents before 2000, you'll find that more than 50% were accounted for by Western countries. But now more than 50% is accounted for by Eastern countries. As technology has begun shifting East, wealth has also begun shifting from the West to the East. Turkey has become an important bridge in the other direction. Turkey's importance has concomitantly improved in terms of air travel, highways, and railways. For example, in the last seven years the Turkish government has built more than 14,000 kilometers of new two-lane highways. Also, in 2011, the budget allocated to the railways has exceeded that which was allocated to roads for the first time. Then there are other high-profile projects such as the Marmaray tunnel under the Bosphorus, and also plans to build a third bridge spanning the Bosphorus. Istanbul has also become a major center for air travel, and there are flights from Istanbul to the four corners of the globe. All in all, Turkey is a major bridge for transportation, natural resources, and also technology.</p><p>In terms of ICT, Turkey has also become a major hub. Keep in mind that satellites aren't enough anymore for global telecommunications. You need fiber optic cables, and you need bandwidth. Turkey has already become a very important fiber hub. Many fiber links pass through Turkey, making it a crucial link in terms of data and broadband communication. In many respects, Turkey is already a major  ICT hub.</p><p>However, we should also keep in mind the massive increase that's been seen in trading volumes over the last few years between Turkey and North Africa, the Middle East, and the Turkic republics in Central Asia. The volume of imports and exports combined has been increasing between 20% and 30% per year. You can pretty much reach everywhere in three hours if you're in Istanbul or Ankara, be it Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Russia, or Central Asia. Economies in those regions are also growing very fast, and Turkey's central location is crucial in terms of doing business.</p><h4>In terms of R&amp;D, how capable is Turkey of producing the right human capital?</h4><p>Turkey has a very high number of well-qualified engineers. There are many excellent engineering schools in Turkey. It's the most prestigious profession among the young generation, and that also bodes very well in terms of Turkey's potential to become a real and globally competitive producer of technology in the near future. Netaş employs many engineers, too. We have around 850 employees, and around 95% of our employees are engineers. About 700 of those employees are in the research and technology field. They're mainly working on development projects for North American and European companies, and we're also developing some projects for the Turkish Armed Forces.</p><h4>Where are you currently focusing your project resources?</h4><p>Our main focus is ICT. Our technology people work on four main areas with outside companies: carrier voiceover IP (VOIP), enterprise VOIP, optical, and GSM technologies. We also have another team of around 100 people who work on local technologies, mainly carrier-grade switching for the Turkish Armed Forces, including the army, navy, gendarmerie, and the air force, together with the Ministry of the Interior.</p><h4>What changes has the company undergone over recent years?</h4><p>Over the last five years we've grown 20%, and we're now worth $179 million, which is a good result for us. Over the past five years we've focused on system integration and defense technologies. From 2006 until now our technology group has grown from 200 employees to almost 700, and the other areas have grown remarkably as well. If you're in systems integration, you have to be into technology too. We develop technologies for GSM, VOIP, and for the optical field. Because those are the main parts of the ICT sector, we know those technologies very well. We don't just provide customers with ready-made products, we also offer experience and consulting to suit the needs and expectations of our clients. The success of those last five years has led us to expand into 20 countries, mainly in North Africa, the Middle East, the Turkic republics, and Eastern Europe. These countries are growing fast and they need ICT solutions, so business is very good.</p><h4>What's your vision for the future of the company?</h4><p>Netaş has a lot of accumulated knowledge. When you look at the last 30 years, this company has generated a lot of technology, from private branch exchange (PBX) to rural switches, big switches, analog, digital, VOIP technology, optical, GSM technologies, and so on. In that regard, Netaş is a very strong company. With our strategy of being a regional systems integrator with a force of 700 R&amp;D engineers, we believe that Netaş's future is very bright indeed. We'll continue to implement our growth strategy, and carry our knowledge, experience, and know-how to foreign countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TurkNet is the largest independent ADSL provider in Turkey, capitalized through foreign venture capital. How does this differentiate the company?<br></h4><p>We have two foreign private equity backers, and we have been around since 1996. This gives us a definite edge. We are purely focused on the telecoms market, and invested at the right time and in the right way. For the customer base, communications can be a sensitive topic, and in that sense our corporate customers have peace of mind that there is no secondary agenda involved. Our history also gives us a certain level of credibility as a lot of conglomerates that have recently entered the market subsequently exited, having not being able to find exactly what they wanted. We have much experience in this sector, we are focused on our aims, and this means that we are here to stay. In terms of innovation, our focus has given us an edge in being able to roll out solutions faster than our competitors. ICT is a very rapidly changing sector, so this is important.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your track record of innovation?</h4><p>We have been leading the sector in terms of many innovations. We were amongst the first alternative operators in Turkey to provide workshop private networks, allowing companies to carry out inter-office communication. We were also the first operator in Turkey to start local unbundling, which is a key benchmark in telecoms liberalization. We were one of the first operators to offer call-by-call services, whereby any telephone subscriber can dial a pre-fixed number to get around the incumbent operator to get a lower rate. On the billing front, we were the first operator to offer the solution of combining bills into a single package. These are services that are prevalent in Western Europe but were lacking in Turkey. We have brought a lot to the sector.</p><h4>Where are you currently focusing your R&amp;D resources?</h4><p>The telecommunications market in Turkey is opening up very rapidly, and it is a very exciting time. This is all due to a new regulatory framework. At the end of 2008 a new telecoms law was passed. Some of the provisions were post-dated by six months into 2009, and then the regulator performed secondary consultations and began to bring everything in line. This process is now beginning to bear fruit, and this has yielded a lot of exciting developments. We now have fixed-number portability in Turkey, and the ability to make fiber investments as alternative operators. In this area TurkNet is investing a lot in metropolitan and international fiber. We believe that the market in Turkey will follow similar developments in Eastern and Western Europe, which means a move towards full unbundling. These are some of the areas we are investing a lot in. Turkey is developing rapidly, yet it is still emerging from a phase in which the incumbent operator retains a fairly significant market share, higher than in Western Europe mainly due to delays in regulatory change. Recently, ADSL operator migration and naked ADSL have become possible. These are very exciting developments. This is driving a lot of the opportunity in the market. Naked ADSL is a way by which you can get a broadband connection without the need to get a phone line as well. This is in high demand, especially amongst the younger population. Finally, the data center market in terms of B2B communications is another interesting area. In 2001 we were one of the first operators to a build fairly substantial, carrier-neutral data center, where any provider of fiber infrastructure is able to converge their network, and this market is growing quickly as more and more companies and international operators are looking to locate their equipment at a data center and access their data there in a secure manner.</p><h4>You mentioned that independent providers are growing in the market quite rapidly. What is your current market share, and what are your goals?</h4><p>According to the regulator, in the broadband and telephony spaces the alternative operators have a combined market share of 10%, with the incumbent retaining around 90%. EU averages for incumbents' market share are generally between 25% and 50%, and so there is a long way to go in the convergence of the Turkish and European story. This is changing quickly, and we expect that in the next couple of years Turkey will resemble European markets more closely than it does currently. The drivers behind this will be some of the regulations that I have mentioned, including fixed-number portability and local unbundling.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish economy and telecoms sector?</h4><p>There are two drivers for our industry. The telecoms sector is very strongly linked to the success of the overall economy. In that respect, we are confident in the growth and development of the sector. Turkey is also still seeing good FDI levels, and this is driving a need for telecommunications services amongst incoming companies. The development of the economy is also driving the need for lower-cost services, and that helps us as an alternative provider. The second driver is the shift to a competitive space from a historically more monopolistic space. Consumers are increasingly aware that they have a choice. This revolution began on the corporate side, but residential consumers are increasingly becoming aware that they can get their telephony and internet services from an alternative provider.</p><h4>You started this company in a transitional time for the sector in 1996. What is your ultimate vision for the future of the company?</h4><p>We see our future on the stock market. Two incumbent companies, Turkcell and Türk Telekom, are listed already, but when you look at comparable stock markets in Eastern and Western Europe alternative telecoms operators are also listed. As the industry grows, a possible listing on the Istanbul Stock Exchange is envisioned. There will be to some extent a consolidation in the sector going forward, meaning perhaps an acquisition of our competitors or the other way around. At the moment in the fixed communications space there isn't any major foreign investment. Going forward as regulatory infrastructure gains clarity for investors it is possible that foreign investors may look to invest into the fixed space. So, we will see. We are focusing on our fiber network and in a few more years that will take us to another level, and an IPO may make sense. We had 40% growth in 2010, and our budget for 2011 targets 75% growth. I think 2013 is a possible date for an IPO.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Turkey play in Europe's energy security?</h4><p>Turkey is of strategic importance because it connects the Caspian region, Central Asia, and the Middle East with Europe. In the 21st century, energy has become a key factor in the determination of foreign policy objectives. Turkey sees solidarity, trust, dialogue, and cooperation as being the foundations of a worthy foreign energy policy. We pursue an active foreign policy when it comes to energy supply security. We conduct meetings that solidify this position as an important player at both a regional and global level. As a result of projects undertaken by the AK Party government, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline (BTC), Nabucco, the Turkey-Greece-Italy Natural Gas Pipeline, and Shah Deniz, Turkey is well on its way to becoming a major energy corridor and terminal. Turkey and Europe must stand together when it comes to energy. Europe needs Turkey, and Turkey needs Europe.</p><h4>What changes has the Nabucco project undergone until now, and can you give us a rundown of any new developments regarding the project?</h4><p>The Project Support Agreements (PSA) that had been prepared for the Nabucco Natural Gas Pipeline Project, which will carry natural gas from the Caucasus and Caspian regions to Europe via Turkey, were recently signed at an official ceremony in Kayseri. International projects of this magnitude can sometimes present threats, while at other times they can offer unique opportunities. It's important to keep moving forward and not become disillusioned. If we believe in this project—and we do—then we must continue developing it. We must do the necessary technical work. Keeping in mind the recent financial crisis, I truly believe that this project will be of great benefit to all participating countries, especially in terms of creating new jobs. The next step is to conclude financial negotiations and agreements with producer countries.</p><h4>In terms of meeting Turkey's energy needs, what steps do you think need to be taken in both the public and private sectors, bearing in mind the country's developing economy and growing population? What role do you think nuclear and renewable energy should play in Turkey's future?</h4><p>Turkey is continually growing. Naturally, the demand for energy is also growing parallel to Turkey's economic growth. We need new investments in order to be able to meet these needs. We need a more liberal and competitive energy sector. That's why we've implemented the necessary changes to pave the way for the private sector to move into the energy sector. As a result of these policies, 52% of the energy sector is now privatized. Our goal is to bring that figure up to 75%. After privatization, services will become more efficient and output will become more productive. We are continuing to take the necessary steps to develop a truly competitive and free energy sector. We have been utilizing our local and renewable resources. We've increased exploration endeavors, and we have several maritime exploration projects in partnership with some of the world's largest companies. Our goal is to utilize all of our local renewable energy reserves and resources. Hydro, wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources are all being put to use. Unfortunately, these don't suffice in meeting the exceptional needs of a growing Turkey, and that's why nuclear energy is not just an option for Turkey, it is a necessity. Our work on building nuclear plants in Sinop and Mersin Akkuyu continues. The two 10,000 MW nuclear plants will hopefully be completed by 2023.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the fourth round of tenders in Iraq and from the natural gas fields in the Siba and Mansuriyah regions? What is Turkey's role in the development of Iraq's oil and gas industry?</h4><p>We place great importance on our relations with Iraq. TPAO and other Turkish companies are doing their utmost to help develop and stabilize the Iraqi oil sector. We'll do the necessary work and preparations to get Turkish companies ready for the fourth round of tenders in Iraq. We are interested in all the fields on offer, whether as private companies or as the public sector. Our involvement in Iraq looks like it will continue to grow. I think our efforts will not only help normalize Iraq, but also further strengthen relations between our two friendly, brotherly, and neighborly nations.</p><h4>What does Turkey offer potential investors in the energy sector?</h4><p>Businessmen and women need to invest their money and experience in the energy sector. As the government, we have given the necessary guarantees and received very positive responses. That is why we must turn this sector into a golden opportunity. We have opened the way for investors with our policies, and we will continue to do so. The energy sector is one that will draw more and more investments. We made a number of amendments to the purchase guarantee system in the recent Renewable Energy Act. Some $14 billion has been invested in the energy sector over the last three years, despite the crisis period. This is a sign of the trust that investors have in Turkey, whether local or foreign. Thanks to its political and economic stability and growth, Turkey has become a magnet for both local and foreign investors, a place they feel secure in, and a place where the necessary energy investments have been realized and will continue to happen.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the level of aluminum production capacity and demand in Turkey?</h4><p>In Turkey there are roughly 100 extrusion companies. Total capacity is around 850,000-900,000 tons, whereas total production is around 450,000-500,000 tons. As you can see, there is a great unbalanced situation. The consumption per capita in Turkey is around 10 kilograms, and should rise to 20-25 kilograms because this is the general rate in Europe and the world. Additionally, when you compare Turkey to larger countries such as Germany and Italy, with similar populations, we see much higher consumption rates. Therefore, what we see in the coming years is an increase in demand. In real terms, a 30% increase in total demand is expected by 2020.</p><h4>Which sectors constitute the biggest demand for Asaş?</h4><p>The construction industry represents most of our business, as it is the third biggest industry in Turkey. With a young population there will be a need for new homes and we expect this to create powerful growth in the coming 10-15 years. The automotive industry is also very significant for us. This is looking positive with the outlook showing more use of aluminum in cars. This will be a good market for extrusion. Another positive sector is the train industry. We see the government putting a lot of attention into that, and this will also be positive for the sector.</p><h4>What changes have you seen in the Turkish market over recent years?</h4><p>A very organized customer base and understanding has emerged in Turkey. There is, however, still a lack of foreign investment in the sector, and so we are hoping for more on that side in the future. In Europe, the average age is much higher, and the younger generations are more comfortable, not working like their parents did. This is not the case in Turkey, and this boosts competition. People still work very hard here, and that has seen the market grow and develop over the years.</p><h4>How would you rate Turkey's production base compared to its competitors for industrial investment, such as Eastern Europe?</h4><p>In addition to the young, robust workforce, which can be hired at a relatively low cost, Turkey also has the advantage of location. Shipments by truck can reach Russia, Germany, or down to Iran and Iraq within a week. In addition, if you consider that Turkish is spoken in countries from Tajikistan to Azerbaijan, there are many advantages. A lot of Turkish construction companies have been carrying out successful business in those regions for years. In addition, Turkey is a stable and democratic country with close proximity to certain regions like Iran and Iraq. It is much easier to serve from here compared to serving from European countries.</p><h4>What investment opportunities do you see in Central Asia?</h4><p>We have already completed many international projects. When we make a significant investment, there needs to be a certain level of trust. From the trust point of view we prefer to make investments in Europe but not in the other Turkic republics. The ethics of business have to be settled. It is too soon to be making investments in those regions, as the right business environments just don't exist yet. We do believe, however, that investments could be possible with the right partners.</p><h4>What kind of investments are you making in R&amp;D?</h4><p>We work in close cooperation with universities and also with the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK). Today, Turkey is a level two economy, meaning it is efficiency driven. Level three is an innovation-driven economy. In level two economies, the GDP per capita is around $3,000-$9,000, and for level three economies, the GDP per capita is over $17,000. When a country is at the efficiency-driven level, the important thing is that the right technology is present and sophisticated products are being produced. To become a level three, innovation-driven economy, a lot of new technologies and sophisticated processes need to be developed. Asaş is playing its part in this process, and we are working on new technologies all the time.</p><h4>Do you have plans to make investments to expand your production line?</h4><p>We have already made investments of over ‚¬100 million. The new production line will be ready in the second half of 2012. We have a market share of 70% in aluminum composite panels. Flat products are the new thing we are working on. We are confident in growing demand. Other metals have been in use for 3,000 years, but aluminum is a young metal. It is the metal of the future, and that makes us brave in our sales figures.</p><h4>What is the ratio of exports to imports, and what are your primary export markets?</h4><p>The export-import ratio is roughly 50-50. Indirectly, there are a lot of customers that buy from us and sell directly to Europe. If you consider those as exports, we reach 70-80% exports. In terms of direct exports, we sell mostly to Western Europe. The reason why that is our target market is because of our quality. If you sell to the East there is price competition and we cannot add value to our products. However, in Europe most of our customers are the leaders of their sectors, and so quality is the most important aspect for them. To add this value to products is key, and that is why we have worked so hard to develop the right technological know-how.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future?</h4><p>For the future we would like to be in the top 25 companies in Turkey. In our sector we would like to be in the top 10 in Europe.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the last few years you have been enhancing your product mix and investing in flat steel production. Can you tell us a bit about your products and where you are focusing your resources?<br></h4><p>We have been in this business for over 50 years. Up until 2005 we only focused on long products: steel billets, reinforcing bars for construction, and wire rope. In 2005 we discussed what our future would look like in an increasingly volatile market. Those times were unpredictable, and things were difficult. In order to remain strong and competitive, we decided to widen our product mix. Turkey produces about three times more long products than the country needs, but on the other hand it can only produce 50% of its flat steel requirements. There was a big gap that was going to be filled eventually. Also, long products only serve the construction industry, while flat products are used by the entire manufacturing industry. Long products represent one-third of the total industry, while flat products serve the other two-thirds. In line with our new strategy, we became the first private company in Turkey to invest in flat steel production. Çolakoğlu has always been a pioneer of the industry. We were one of the first to install continuous casting machines, to build our own power stations, and to set the plants right outside ports for ease of access. We then wanted to be the first private entity to invest in flat steel. We studied various projects, made certain agreements, and finally started investments that were completed in June 2010. Today we are thinking about the next steps. The business is strong, we still cover the long products for construction, and we now cover hot-rolled products, which are a key raw material for the automotive industry, for household appliances, and for machinery.</p><h4>What are your most important export markets and are there efforts to explore new ones?</h4><p>In the past, 80% of our output went to China, and later a significant portion of our output went to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Following economic instability in that region we were forced to diversify our export markets. I am proud at how much we have diversified. Our primary goal, however, is to maintain market share in places that are politically and economically stable. Egypt, for example, is an example to the contrary. In 2008 Turkish reinforcing bar exports to Egypt were zero. In 2009 exports were at 2.5 million tons, though in 2010 they fell to 500,000 tons. This is why the EU, the US, and Canada are important markets for us. We want to maintain a stable market share in these areas.</p><h4>When you built your melt shop for flat production, you commissioned the world's largest electric arc furnace. What advantage does this create for flat steel production?</h4><p>Flat products—sheets, coils, plates—are usually manufactured by blast furnace mills, which use iron ore. On the long products side, the main portion is produced by electric arc furnaces, which use steel scrap as a raw material. Today we are continuing to use scrap products to create flat metals. This practice was first started in the US, and became very successful. Others in the world have followed the same path, such as Hyundai in South Korea and SABIC in Saudi Arabia. Our electric arc furnace is 300 tons in capacity and is the largest one operating in the world today, though there are more to come as others consider taking this step. There is talk about another Turkish company installing a 400-ton furnace. It seems the industry standard today is about 250 tons. Our first furnace in 1968 was only five tons.</p><h4>What's next for Çolakoğlu?</h4><p>We may go downstream to do some more value-adding. We also aim to cover a bigger portion of the market by enriching the product quality and type. We produce hot-roll coil that is then further processed into cold-rolled coil and coated with either zinc or paint. Before steel is applied to a car body or a fridge, producers make such products thinner, stronger, and then add a protective coating before painting. We are interested in playing a larger role in this value-adding chain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-lions-life-a-la-turca]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are driving the growth of domestic demand for cars in Turkey?</h4><p>First of all, we have to consider the size of the auto fleet in Turkey. For every 1,000 people there are 135 to 140 cars. In Western Europe there are 500 to 600 cars per 1,000 people. That means that in Turkey there is a lack of cars. People need more cars than we are selling today. There are roughly 72 million inhabitants in Turkey, yet there are only 10 million cars. The amount of cars is five times less than it should be. If you visit Turkey or Istanbul, you can see a lot of public transport. There are more buses and minibuses than in any other country. However, a car in Turkey is very expensive due to taxes. There are three types of taxes. The first type is the Special Consumption Tax (ÖTV). For a car with an engine capacity lower than 1,600 cc, the tax is 37%. If it is between 1,600 cc and 2 liters, it is 60%. If it is over 2 liters, then it is 84%. On top of that there is VAT, which is 18%. In addition to that, as in any country, you have a tax two times a year that is roughly ‚¬300. Taxation is very high. As a result, it is difficult for people to buy cars unless their credit is good. In the last decade in Turkey we have had a very stable rate of inflation. When you have a high level of inflation, you have a high level of interest in credit. Inflation has decreased and stabilized now. The credit rate has decreased a lot. For the customer, there is a very good advantage in buying a car now. This started at the beginning of 2010. The market has improved a lot since then. It is part of the reason that we have reached 760,000 cars sold since the beginning of 2010, which is 37% more than it was in the previous year. However, the normal market for this kind of population should be close to 1.5 million vehicles. In France, for example, the market is close to 2 million cars per year.</p><h4>What models do you find are particularly successful in the Turkish market?</h4><p>Small cars are very popular here. I believe it is a part of the B segment. This for us is the 206, the 207, the Clio, and so on. This is due to the capacity of the engine and the price of the cars. The taxes vary for different types of cars. Light commercial vehicles carry another level of taxation. A vehicle that can carry 75 times the weight of each passenger has a 10% tax, whereas a car designed for individual usage has a 37% tax. Therefore, the market for light commercial vehicles is huge and it is successful. Sedan cars are also successful in Turkey. Here you can see cars with trunks—even in the small segment. This type of car gives status here, and so we are selling a lot of them.</p><h4>What steps have you taken to increase Peugeot's market capture in Turkey since you came in as General Manager in 2007?</h4><p>We started the subsidiary of Peugeot in Turkey in 2001. At this time we asked for new investors to make dealerships and to invest a lot because our expectations were high. Peugeot's revenues between 2004 and 2005 were very successful and we reached a market share of 10%. After, we dropped in terms of sales. When I arrived I tried to re-motivate the staff. I used my recent arrival—a change—to re-motivate them. On top of that, I would say that they let me adapt our commercial policy toward Turkey. Before coming here, I was in charge of Poland, Africa, and the French Territories. I also worked in South America. I always say that when I arrive, I arrive with experience. I use this as a fact to allow myself to be confident in what I do. As a result, I adapted to the Turkish system quickly. I was listening to the network and trying to understand the market. I would say that Peugeot became Turkish quickly. We have also added good products. We launched the Bipper, which is a Turkish car produced in the Tofaş plant in Bursa. After that we launched the 3008 and the 5008. Those models have helped a lot to recover our market share. We have now reached 5.7%. This is not enough. If you look at our presence in the market in terms of model range, we have an answer for only 64% of the demand. If you apply our 5.7% of the 64% to the entire market, then we have close to 9% of the market. We have 84% of the market in light commercial vehicles. Today, with that, we have between 9% and 12% of the market share. Overall, the position of Peugeot in Turkey should be between 8% and 10% minimum.</p><h4>What are the prospects of Peugeot investing in production here in Turkey?</h4><p>At this point it is important to discuss why we did not finish the project that we had started here before the crisis. It was in October of 2008. Due to the effect of the crisis, the capacity of our plants in Western Europe was not totally used. As we had unused capacity in European plants, we chose not to invest more abroad in new plants without fulfilling the capacity of our plants in Western Europe. The car we were supposed to produce in Turkey ended up being produced in Spain. This car, which is a sedan, will start to be produced in 2012. It is a very successful car in Turkey but it will also have to be successful in North Africa. When I see the car, I still believe that it has a market in Europe. This means that the potential of the plant in Spain will not be sufficient in the future. If the Turkish market continues to improve, we will need cars and maybe at this moment we will need to make a new investment for Peugeot. At this moment, I am convinced that Turkey will part of the decision.</p><h4>How would you rank the production base of Turkey compared to other countries?</h4><p>There are two important things here. In the production of cars, Turkey has significant experience. It has been producing cars for more than 30 years. The industry has learned a lot and learned quickly. Secondly, Turkish people take a lot of pride in their work. As a result, the quality of the cars produced here is very good. In my career, I also saw that in Chile as well. The quality in Turkey and Chile is very good. If you ever have a problem with a car as it comes off the assembly line, you only have to say something once. This is because it will not happen a second time. Quality is very important here. For the price, Poland is less expensive than Turkey. Turkish production is not as high as Western Europe, but is not the lowest in the area. It is not for cost that we come to Turkey—we come because the suppliers are here. We buy parts in Turkey to export to the French plant and other countries. The suppliers and technology are present and the quality is good. When you look at the cost of a car, logistics are very important. You have to produce cars where you are selling them. If you produce a car and then have to send it around the world, you can be sure you will not be competitive on price. To produce a car, we have to be confident that the market where we produce this car will be good. This is also a reason why we chose Turkey for this project. In addition, 80% of Turkish production is exported to Western Europe. This means that the quality of the car is good and the technology is good too. The main issue in Turkey for us is that the currency is not the euro. When we have to play with the exchange rate, sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not good. But this is the only risk, and so there is no doubt that we have to produce cars in Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[made-to-measure]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Temsa is aggressively developing its position as a global brand. Which markets are proving to be the most interesting?</h4><p>The most interesting markets are those in which the customer appreciates our product. When I came to this company, which was fairly recently, my judgment was that the priority should be Turkey. There must be a strong foothold here. This was already the case, but we must make this even more so. This will be followed by our European business. We exist in Europe, but we have neglected some regions. Our strongest presence is in France. As far as I remember, we have 3,500 Temsa-branded vehicles running there, and we work with a very active distributor who frequently visits our Adana plant. France is followed by Italy, then Germany, the UK, and Belgium. Those are the important ones, but we have shipments to a total of 46 countries. I had hesitations about the US when I came into the company. It is a huge country with a huge market and can be extremely dangerous. But then I listened to our directors and general managers and thought, there's something to this, I have to go and see. After I came back I realized that we must go strong into the US.</p><p>The US has a totally different design process. For example, in Europe or Turkey, it's always a one-piece windscreen. In the US, it's always split, and the wipers are vertical. There are regulatory reasons for that. They also want one single door just to the right of the driver, so that the driver knows exactly who's getting on the bus and who's getting off. In other markets it's at least two, sometimes three doors. It's a unique design.</p><h4>As you enter new markets and fleet owners consider your brand compared to their existing fleets, what are Temsa's competitive advantages?</h4><p>We have a very powerful R&amp;D department. Our Adana plant has a 6,000-square-meter R&amp;D building. We have 135 people employed in that department. A total of 65 of them are qualified design engineers making bus designs from scratch with 3D computer designs to the customers' exact specifications. Our buses are handmade. Nothing is mass produced. Every single lot of orders is different from the others, be it three units, 10 units, or 20. Every customer will have different demands, like where they want the toilet placed, the number of doors, and the height arrangements. Then the engineers start working, and that's our strength. We can meet every customer request.</p><h4>For Temsa, 2008 and 2009 were about restructuring, while 2010 was about careful management. What will 2011 be like?</h4><p>Nothing will change in 2011. There will be no new investments, licensing, or ventures. The reason for this is that I want to see Temsa on a more sustainable growth path. The goals are to improve quality, reduce costs, raise motivation, as well as facilitate some minor restructuring and organization, and all of these things should happen in 2011. In my opinion, 2011 will be the year we finally see the back of the lingering effects of the crisis. In that respect, I think 2012 will be a huge growth year, like we had in 2002 and 2003. I have many ideas in mind about how to develop the company, but all that has to wait until the base is solid and reliable.</p><h4>What are the strengths and challenges of the Turkish economy, and what does that mean for the company?</h4><p>I've been asked that question at least 250 times worldwide. Everyone wants to know. We are a new nation and an old nation, in terms of the Republic of Turkey and the Ottoman Empire that preceded it. When the Republic was established in 1923 nothing was being produced on these lands, and there was no tradition of marketing. Everything changed in the early years of the Republic, and I believe the first plant was established to serve the cotton industry. As a result of staying out of World War II, we maintained a steady development path and managed to foster such genius entrepreneurs as Sabancı and Koç, whose families still run the largest holding companies in the country. Government support has also been crucial in this development. When I graduated from university in 1974, only Renault and Fiat were producing cars in Turkey, and only 5,000 units were rolling off the production lines each year. It is therefore mind-blowing how quickly Turkey has developed in the automotive sector. Today, Turkey produces over 1 million units per year.</p><h4>Do you think Turkey's global reputation will catch up with its record of quality?</h4><p>For Toyota it already has. In Europe, distributors prefer cars produced in Turkey over other units from other production facilities. The same applies to buses. Motor vehicles involve a huge level of technological production. Around 12,000 engineers work in R&amp;D for Toyota, day and night, to simulate pressures and work on customer preferences. It's a very high-tech product, and if you can make a motor vehicle, then you can make almost anything. Turkey has very high potential in every field. This country is increasingly building unique products, and products designed exactly to the customers needs are what sets the country apart. Turkey's strength lies in its young population, with their courage and energy. There is an entrepreneurial mindset here. I often meet American, German, and Japanese businessmen, and it is obvious that they thoroughly enjoy doing  business with us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dare-to-fly]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of being both a German-based and a Turkish-based consultancy company?</h4><p>In the aerospace and defense sectors you have to develop new things, new technologies. This requires know-how and experience. European aerospace and defense companies have this experience, while in Turkey they are new to some areas. I connect European aerospace and defense companies with Turkish companies to develop projects in Turkey. This is an advantage. Some European and US companies have been doing this for 100 years, but Turkish aerospace and defense companies are not older than 25 years at the most. In some areas, they need a lot of support for the development of new technologies. This is what I am doing, bringing the know-how and technology to Turkey, bringing European companies together, and creating cooperation for  new programs.</p><h4>Although Turkish companies are young, are there areas where they excel or offer a competitive advantage?</h4><p>They are young companies, but Turkey is buying many aerospace and defense products. For example, Turkish Airlines has ordered 65 new Airbus planes. In Turkey, companies do not want to only buy the products now, they want to develop and produce the products themselves as much as possible. There is a 50% offset, which means some part of the production occurs in Turkey. In other words, if Turkey buys 35 aircraft from Lockheed, they enter into industrial cooperation and some parts of the aircraft are built here in Turkey. For example, they might build the door in Turkey, and then sell it to the corporation. In the future, companies want to produce the whole system. It is cheaper to produce in Turkey than in Europe, and this is an advantage, but the biggest advantage may be the people. There are a lot of well-educated people in Turkey, and they are very eager for new ideas and new technologies. Part of this is the fact that Turkey is young. The average age in the country is 28 years. In Germany I think it is over 45. In Germany there are 20 million people over 65, but Turkey has 28 million people below 24. If you look at people over 60 they want stability. But young people want innovation. At this moment Germany would like to have stability, but young people in Turkey want to move into the next 20 years. They want to change. You can feel this in Turkey. Another advantage is the fact that Istanbul is developing as a center for Europe and Asia. There are 15 million people living here, and I think the crisis in the Arab region is bringing Turkey forward. Although we are dynamic, we have a stable democracy. As a result, we are becoming an anchor in the region.</p><h4></h4><h4>The Turkish government wants to increase R&amp;D spending to 2% of GDP. What is Turkey's potential to become an innovator of this type of technology?</h4><p>In Germany R&amp;D spending is around 8% of GDP, but in Turkey it is still low. However, the Prime Minister and the government are going to increase the budget. This means that Turkey can increase its own products for domestic consumption as well as become a hub for markets outside of Turkey, to the near east or to the Central Asia. Sometimes it is very easy to sell Turkish products outside of Turkey. They can be sold cheaper than European products because labor prices are still lower than in Europe. This is an advantage for Turkey. I say to European companies that they should come to Turkey, cooperate with these companies, develop new products, and sell their products together with  Turkish companies.</p><h4>You have established yourself among the larger companies in the industry. What motivated you to break off and create your own consultancy?</h4><p>I was previously working at EADS Holding on a project with Turkey. I had contacts in Turkey, and I could see that there was a huge need for new technologies, know-how, and consulting. When I started consulting it was not just for aerospace and defense, it was in general to support European companies, to make market analysis on Turkey, to develop market entry strategies for the companies in Turkey, and to advise on how to start a business in this country. We consulted for a lot of companies in Europe, and later on in my company in Ankara we started to consult aerospace and defense companies in Turkey. Still, what we are doing is not only aerospace and defense. We are doing it in all sectors. We have some different projects. Maybe 60% or 70% is aerospace and defense, but we have other projects too.</p><h4>Can you tell us about some of these projects?</h4><p>After seven years since the establishment of my consulting company a lot of companies know what I am doing, and now they are coming to me with projects. One interesting project that we want to start in Turkey is fish farming. There is a huge consortium in Germany, and they asked me if they could do it in Turkey. The idea is that we will not produce fish in the sea but rather do it on land, in small pools, so we do not depend on the weather. There is a demand for this. If you go to the Mediterranean Sea, the Aegean Sea, or the Marmara, there are not enough fish anymore. Starting from April until September, most of the fish consumed in Turkey is imported. That is why we are developing this huge project. I have another project where I am going to start to produce a two-seater sport aircraft in Turkey. We are going to establish a company in Ankara or Istanbul at the Sabiha Gökçen Airport, and we are going to produce civil aircraft in Turkey for the first time.</p><h4>Six years ago you wrote a book that became a best seller among aerospace and defense literature. What made your book have such widespread appeal?</h4><p>I wrote this book without using complex equations. I had questions about the aerospace industry, and I answered them using easy words that everybody can understand. For engineers it is very easy to answer a question with an equation, but it is difficult to answer a question and explain it with normal language. Questions like “How does an aircraft fly?" If you use Bernoulli's Principle, nobody will understand.</p><h4>How would you rate Turkey as a production base?</h4><p>It has a lot of advantages. You have well-educated people, not only engineers but certified technicians. People are very motivated, and the salaries are still lower than in Western Europe. I think there are a lot of advantages for European companies to produce in Turkey. And the quality is good. You can establish a good quality because you can use the gold standards and apply them to companies here, and so there is no difference. But you have to coordinate it very well. Sometimes it is not easy because Turkish companies may not always deliver on time. You have to manage it differently and force them to deliver on time with contract penalties, or you have to supervise them and check the production yourself.</p><h4>What is your view for the future of the Turkish aerospace and defense industry?</h4><p>It is a young sector for Turkey, but the need is there, and there are highly qualified engineers to develop new products. The 50% offset legislation is also supporting the industry. However, Turkish companies need to cooperate much more with their European and international counterparts to benefit from their experience. One practical thing that must change in order to facilitate this is the visa situation between Turkey and the EU. The EU's visa regulations toward Turkey are not acceptable for business. This is a problem for some Turkish businessmen. This is slowing down trade between Europe and Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the origins of Proteksan Turquoise Yachts?</h4><p>The company is a joint venture between two companies: Proteksan and Turquoise. Turquoise was my company and Proteksan was my partner's company. My partner's father started building yachts in the 1970s and he built several yachts for the European market. I started building yachts in 1990 and delivered the first boat to an American owner. Thirteen years ago we joined forces and formed one company. Since then we have produced about 13 boats together, and we also have some six under construction. The average size has been around 55 meters. Our companies were similar in nature and the combined force of the new company has improved our order book considerably compared to our European competitors. During the last few years it has been established that our quality is higher than companies in Europe, and this has promoted our sales tremendously.</p><h4>Turkey is one of the largest producers of mega yachts in the world, what is behind the success?</h4><p>Turkey is now a major player in yacht construction for the simple reason that there is a tradition of building boats here. According to Showboats International, Turkey is number three in the world after Italy and the US. Since even before the Ottoman period, vessels have been built in these lands and this tradition has continued on from generation to generation. This has afforded us ample craftsmanship; coupled with lower labor costs and good entrepreneurial skills, these make Turkey a leader in quality yacht building. We maintain our position in defiance of the low cost of labor in the Far East as we are much closer to our markets. Therefore, we have more orders and have developed our skills much further than others.</p><h4>Who are Proteksan Turquoise Yacht's main competitors?</h4><p>We haven't traditionally targeted the Turkish market, and so our competitors are international. Our main competition lies in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, and the US. There are lots of wealthy people in Turkey, yet many of them are not looking to buy yachts. When they do, Turkish buyers prefer to go for foreign products. We find our buyers in the British market as well as in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. We have clients from Israel, Kazakhstan, England, Italy, Switzerland, and the US.</p><h4>How developed are marina facilities in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey's marinas are superior to facilities in Europe. Their quality outdoes all facilities around the Mediterranean because they are newer and more modern. We have a high capacity, and the government is working on providing even more land for marinas.</p><h4>When you take an order, how closely do you work with the client on the design of a yacht?</h4><p>This varies entirely depending on the client. Some owners buy an existing design from us so they can then tweak the interior. Some will come with their own design. Sometimes, they will accept our platform to build on, but they will have their own designs to modify it according to their own wishes. Some of the boats that we have under construction have been designed totally in house by our dedicated design team. We also often outsource the design to offices around Turkey. We are committed to our clients and accommodate their needs entirely.</p><h4>You are currently working on a 74-meter boat designed by Andrew Winch. How is this project progressing?</h4><p>The design stage is finished and we will build the hull until the superstructure. It has been on the market for the last few months and we are receiving serious enquiries. Before the hull is finished it will most probably be sold. We will wait to build the superstructure until we have an owner so they have the chance to modify it if they wish to do so. It is a beautiful design and an exciting project for the company.</p><h4>How did you see the global economic crisis affect the industry?</h4><p>The industry in general has been very adversely affected. Some shipyards went out of business due to a lack of clients. In the years preceding the crisis there was big demand and not enough supply. Many new shipyards came into the picture and obtained business. Unfortunately, this is not sustainable as those clients are just not there anymore. People would order boats and the shipyard would speculatively sell on for those who did not want to remain four to five years on a waiting list. Shipyards around the world now have the capacity to begin building immediately. It was a builder's market and now it is a client's market. Buyers now have more choices and can search for the best price. However, we have not suffered. I attribute this to our fantastic reputation and superb quality.</p><h4>Proteksan Turquoise Yachts' Pendik facility is supported by subsidiary Çelik Yat, which constructs hulls and superstructures. How are you utilizing the expanded capacity that this brings?</h4><p>Proteksan Turquoise Yachts' facility in Istanbul's Pendik has a capacity of four yachts up to 80 meters in length. Presently Çelik Yat, located in Gölcük, works to produce hulls and superstructures for Proteksan Turquoise Yachts only. This allows us an even greater production capacity. However, we are seeking European builders so that we can supply them partly completed yachts from that facility. This will allow us to fully utilize our extended capacity and also help to bring down our partner's costs.</p><h4>Is there any demand for more traditional Turkish wooden ships?</h4><p>There is more and more demand as they are very comfortable, and are built and maintained easily. They are also less expensive. I see them increasingly in European marinas. However we do not construct that kind of boat, rather we focus on metal, steel, and aluminum superstructures. We are aiming to compete with the best mega-yacht yards around the world. Of course, if a client wants a Turkish feel to a boat, we are more than happy to give the interior design a little Oriental touch.</p><h4>What has been your personal favorite yacht?</h4><p>We produced a smallish 42-meter yacht for a Turkish client; it was then sold to Johnny Depp. That yacht was very different from the others as it had an Edwardian 1920s style. It's now called Vajoliroja.</p><h4>Have you had any other famous clients?</h4><p>Yes, we produced two boats for Formula One boss Bernie Eccleston. After we built him the first boat we became very well acquainted. This led him to bring Formula One to Turkey. He has done great things for us and we are very grateful. We built another boat for an associate of his. We believe the prestige he has brought our company has helped us to gain more clients. He speaks highly of us and of Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-wave-maker]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Yachtley's signature projects since the company's inception in 2005?</h4><p>We've finished the biggest mega-yacht ever built in Turkey, the 65-meter Nourah of Riyadh, designed for a Saudi prince. It was handed over by Minister Kürşad Tüzmen on April 2009. At the owner's request, the 65-meter Nourah of Riyadh was refitted to 70 meters in 2011. This refit work started in September 2010 and was finished on May 10, 2011. Now, the 70-meter Nourah of Riyadh is at berth in its home port of Cannes. In addition to this project we have carried out a 40-meter refit work for a Middle Eastern owner in 2010, and now we're building a 76-meter mega yacht for another Middle Eastern owner. Our mother company Fal Holding, based in Saudi Arabia, includes close to 100 companies, diversified in energy, technology, logistics, health care, real estate, agriculture, travel, and other production business sectors around the world. Here in Turkey, in addition to the construction and furniture businesses, we mainly work on commercial ship construction, military projects, refit jobs, and mega-yacht building, all of which require a high level of expertise. Our quality, safety, and environmental policies are certified by Lloyd's and we follow international quality standards. Since most of our top personnel have international expertise and experience in management, our company's decision process and its success percentage is higher than other companies in Turkey. Since the crisis, the ship building industry in Turkey went through a process of introspection. Decision processes, marketing approaches, production vision, and most of all crisis management are some of the factors that the shipbuilding industry has been trying to understand lately. It is changing fast after the crisis and better standards are being adopted by Turkish shipyards to increase their competitiveness.</p><p>We had some advantages during these times because of the vision and experience that we managed to draw from the diversity of our holding group. We mainly focused on our organization level and the crucial steps that we need to take to be ready for any event and to take advantages of any occasion. These steps led us to develop the biggest floating dock in Turkey for refit projects. In addition, we started a joint venture company in painting to take advantage of international refit work by having the most valuable and well-known painting company in Europe on our side. We boast a software joint venture as well that helps us streamline and professionalize our production process, and we're hoping to sell it to other countries.</p><h4>Why did Fal Holding choose Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is always adapting and changing and improving conditions for foreign investment and business. Everyone has seen the change over the last 10 years, and it's been remarkable. The government has especially sought to entice Middle Eastern investors. Having found a mega-yacht customer, we decided to open up the company in Turkey and use the Kocaeli Free Zone, which is advantageous in terms of tax and costs. It was all built in five years. We've almost finished two yachts, and completely finished two refit projects. The other reason for making such an investment in Turkey is that it is emerging as a hub in the region and it's profitable to be here. We work in many segments and we have a high degree of trust from the government, and so Turkey is a good place to base the business.</p><h4>What is the size of your production facilities?</h4><p>We have a 102,800-meter-square facility, making us the biggest in the Kocaeli Free Zone. We have the biggest covered shed area for yachts—over 26,000 square meters—and the biggest covered production hangar, which is 120 meters by 30 meters and is 32 meters height. For us to step up to this level is very important. We have been analyzing the market and the industry for over five years, and we have a team of specialists who can evaluate what is coming and how we can be ready for it. Through this analysis, we decided to offer what is not being offered to be able to increase our market share. Such services include a covered shed for refit work and painting for safety and environmental issues as well as high quality levels. Our steel and aluminum cutting techniques represent the highest level of technological investment. We also continue to grow. We're investing an additional ‚¬1 million in our furniture department. That's very important for drawing customers, because they place a great deal of importance in our professionalism.</p><h4>Is the furniture department for the local market or for the international market?</h4><p>It's for the international market. We started off making furniture for our mega-yachts, but are now also producing for special projects in the Middle East. Some of the projects we are working on are in the construction segment. Spreading investments has good potential advantages for branching out into other projects.</p><h4>What is Turkey's potential for becoming a major player in yacht building?</h4><p>We have a big potential, but compared to countries like the Netherlands, Germany, or Italy, where companies have over 30 years experience with mega-yachts, Turkey has only begun being spoken about since 2000. Now the mega-yacht sector here is of the utmost professionalism and quality, and is a viable competitor. Government regulations have changed. Companies have stepped up to the plate. Quality is key here, and also trust. A person willing to spend millions of euros on a luxury yacht is not going to take any chances or seek to cut any corners. So you have to offer the best there is to offer at the best cost possible. That being said, cost has become a factor in the past three or four years, and so Turkey, where production costs are cheaper, has stood out and gained more of the share in the global mega-yacht business.</p><h4>What's your expectation for the mega-yacht market in general?</h4><p>The 2008 crisis had an effect on the market, but the effect didn't last too long and now things are picking up. In 2008-2009 there would've been only 20 yachts built in Europe. Now there are big orders being made in Europe and Turkey for 2012. For that reason, I'm very optimistic. Being from a finance background, I'm very rarely optimistic. I am optimistic about our marketing approaches, and the results of our tactical investment steps. We will start our third yacht at the end of 2011 and then another one in 2012.</p><h4>What's your long-term vision?</h4><p>It's limitless due to our holding company. We are the only company in Turkey that didn't experience the ill effects of the financial crisis. That doesn't mean we don't have to generate profit—we do have to—and we do generate profit. But we have that security behind us.</p><p>We hope to become a top five player with our financial strength in the next five to eight years, and we also plan to be on the stock market in that same period. Our investments in quality also have this stock market goal in mind. Our other goal is to be a key player in military projects as well. We will also acquire more land in the Free Zone, and we also have 206,000 square meters of land in Yalova. The extra capacity should cover more military projects as well as mega-yachts, refits, and also commercial ships.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>Five babies are born every second around the world. By 2050 there will be 9 billion people on the earth, up from almost 7 billion today. Emerging markets are entering the most energy-intensive phase of development. Everyday more people are enjoying the benefits of a modern lifestyle, buying their first fridges, air conditioners, computers or cars—things their grandparents could see only in their dreams. Underlying global demand for energy by 2050 is likely to triple from its 2000 level if emerging economies follow historical patterns of development.</p><p>How are we going to meet this demand? Innovation for sure will improve efficiency, and could moderate growth by around 20%. Energy supplies might also grow by 50%, taking geological, competitive, financial, and political realities into account. But this still leaves a big gap between supply and demand, as big as the whole industry in 2000. This gap will have to be bridged by an extraordinary moderation of demand, a significant jump in energy supply, or a combination of both. This is what our scenario planners call the “Zone Of Uncertainty". A zone of misery or opportunities for the globe will depend on how the world responds to this.</p><p>Increased consumption will also impact the environment. There is clearly an interlinked challenge between the economy, energy, and the environment. This leads us to the second challenge, as the energy sources to meet demand need to be available, accessible, and acceptable.</p><p>Take natural gas, for example. It is by far the cleanest burning fossil fuel, emitting half or less CO2 than coal-fired plants. Power plants fired by natural gas also cost less and can be built faster, and can be switched on and off more easily, complementing the intermittent power needs of wind and solar.</p><p>The supply picture for natural gas has improved spectacularly in the past few years, driven by the boom in tight and shale gas in North America and coal-bed methane in Australia. These have freed up supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) destined for the US from other parts of the world, and it has inspired nations to search for new gas resources themselves. Natural gas's abundance and affordability, and crucially its lower CO2 footprint, should ensure an increasingly prominent role for this resource in the future.</p><p>International Energy Agency forecasts suggest that almost 50% of primary demand in 2030 will still be met by oil and gas. Turkey's central and strategic location straddling Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East, adjacent to more than 70% of the world's proven oil and gas reserves, makes the country a vital transit route and a potential hub. Additionally, its importance is set to grow as new fields in the Caspian, Central Asia, and Iraq come on stream.</p><p>As one of the world's fastest growing economies, Turkey has also experienced a rapid increase in its own energy needs. This trend will continue, and is projected to reach 220 million TOE  (tons of oil equivalent) in 2020, more than a 100% increase in current consumption. Electricity demand has also significantly increased in recent years and has quadrupled since 1990. On the fuels side, diesel and AutoLPG are growing faster than gasoline due to the tax regime. One downside to this is that only around 30% of Turkey's energy needs are met by domestic resources, while the rest originate from a diversified portfolio of imports.</p><p>It is in this context that Shell considers Turkey a key country. We have been active in Turkey since 1923 across a range of businesses including the exploration, supply, distribution, and marketing of fuels and LPG, chemicals, natural gas, and the manufacturing and marketing of lubricants. Shell has been since then the forerunner of the Turkish oil industry, raising the standards of the market and increasing health, safety, and environmental awareness and performance amongst its employees, suppliers, and contractors. For over 88 years Shell has continued its investments in Turkey, creating a state of the art supply and distribution infrastructure, increasing storage capacity to 12 depots and terminals, and introducing many technological and operational developments.</p><p>In 2006, in line with the growth aspiration of the country, we established a joint venture with Turcas Petrol. Doubling the Shell-branded retail network to more than 1,000 stations, the joint venture has maintained consistent growth and remarkable operational results. Currently it is Turkey's sixth largest private company. Its lubricants and grease production plant exports to 44 countries. Shell and Turcas have also been recognized globally as a world-class model for merger and integration. This venture is a strong example of a successful downstream partnership between a Turkish and a multinational company that has contributed to the growth of the economy and industry.</p><p>The success of this merger is also testament to the fact that Turkey's location as well as energy demands create significant opportunities. Now Turkey must focus on meeting its growing demand for gas and oil from its own resources through exploration and production. These factors, in concert with Turkey's dynamic economy and highly capable workforce, make it clear that this is a country that no serious business can ignore.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the mutual benefits of the NAI-Aristan partnership?</h4><p>The real estate boom experienced in Kazakhstan in the late 2000s worked to the advantage of many international real estate consulting companies, boosting their development and investment ventures in the country. We met with NAI at an annual international real estate forum in Germany, and a process of dialogue began that turned into cooperation and partnership. Real estate plays an important role in the Kazakhstani economy, and developing real estate has become more than a local venture, with international standards and technology applied across the country. Aristan, as a local company, needed a global partner to be able to meet the growing demand for real estate. NAI, as a global operation, has shared its experience with us, and allowed us access to its global connections. These global connections are vital, as we are now able to provide services to more multinational companies operating in Kazakhstan. Considering the fact that almost all the top Fortune 1,000 companies are present in emerging countries such as Kazakhstan, NAI and Aristan couldn't have afforded to miss out on the benefits that partnership has brought. Furthermore, our global presence gives us an opportunity to facilitate growing Kazakhstani companies in their expansion needs on the international markets.</p><h4>NAI Global offers a wide range of services internationally. Which services are on offer in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our services encompass consulting, valuations, and agency services, which include extensive market research to produce feasibility studies and “Highest and Best Use" analysis for real estate. Our property valuation services are delivered in accordance with the standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and Kazakhstani valuation standards. Transactions practice, property dispositions, acquisitions, and corporate services provide insight into market sentiments. We also have a company that provides property and asset management services. In fact, it is currently the sole independent property management company in Kazakhstan. It has launched three shopping centers and two business centers in Kazakhstan. We have a third company that provides project management and construction services for corporate real estate—specifically shopping areas. We have grown into a group of companies that employs 200 people with three main branches.</p><h4>What are your niche targets?</h4><p>In the real estate business we mainly target the retail industry, in which we possess great expertise due to our experience. Although we have existed for only four years, we have combined the experience of both local and foreign experts to work for us on several projects. We believe that in this niche we really possess strong advantages. We are currently present only in Almaty and Astana, but we plan to expand into other regions such as western Kazakhstan. In addition, based on our global capabilities we perform research on a number of dedicated niche services that could be adapted to local market needs.</p><h4>What are the occupancy rates across all classes of office space in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>A-class office space occupancy levels are at around 50%, and moving rapidly towards 60% due to the improving market. For B- and C-class office space, occupancy rates are at around 85%. The key reason for low occupancy levels in A-class is that prices are high. Project financing in Europe is cheaper as financing leverage is 5-10% per annum. In Kazakhstan the range is double this. This makes project financing extremely expensive. Also, because of the complexity of Almaty city, which possess almost 80% of all office space available in Kazakhstan, it is a high-risk area for earthquakes. Hence, construction material costs are higher, and obtaining project approval and permits is more expensive. Thus, in Kazakhstan, despite their needs, some international companies prefer to stay in A- or B-class offices.</p><h4>What is the state of the retail sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The global retail development index states that for a retail market to be considered developed it needs the presence of more than 500 global retail brands. In Kazakhstan there is in total slightly more than 200 brands, half of which are either local, or only represented in two or three countries, which brings us down to 100 global retail brands. Only 50 of them are aggressive and actively seeking to develop their brands in the country. There hasn't been consolidation in the market, and there is still a long way to go. Retailers have chosen not to expand because there is a lack of quality space to expand into. However, fundamentally, the retail sector has positive growth perspectives since we still lack a sufficient number of shopping centers in Almaty and other developing cities in Kazakhstan and have a growing consumer market.</p><h4>What investment opportunities do you see for foreign investors in real estate?</h4><p>Compared with other countries in the region, Kazakhstan presents many opportunities for real estate investment because there is still demand for commercial real estate. In the retail segment, the demand is very clear—there is a need for quality space. In the residential and office segments there is still demand, but market studies should be carried out thoroughly. The residential market will recover in the coming two to three years as there is an annual need of more than 1 million square meters in the market. There is also room for specific investments in office space for large companies. However, in the open market the risk remains rather high.</p><h4>What can NAI Aristan offer to the development of retail quality in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>As property consultants we aim to bring the highest value to our clients through various solutions that enhance retail development projects and help avoid potential obstacles. In addition, the traditional risks inherent to retail property developments, the country's emerging market status, and post-crisis uncertainty make retail real estate development even more complicated. Therefore, professional advice together with pro-active management is vital for the success of property development projects. Basically, our commitment to bring the highest value is based on an understanding of the importance of retailing space infrastructure to the economic and social well being of Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Does your portfolio of operations reflect Renco-AK's global spread?</h4><p>Renco-AK is a sister company of Renco Group, a leading worldwide company involved mainly in the oil and gas, construction, and building management sectors. At this stage Renco Group in Kazakhstan is acting through its sister company Renco-AK and Renco-Kat mostly in the real estate sector, but in the past was involved in the construction of oil and gas infrastructure in Kashagan.</p><h4>Renco manages all phases of a real estate project from A to Z. What competitive edge does this give to your company?</h4><p>To be the constructor and the management company of a building gives us the opportunity to guarantee high standards of construction and a uniqueness of service.</p><h4>How has your relationship with contractors evolved over the years?</h4><p>When we first came here we worked with very few sub-contractors. At the very beginning, all of our construction was carried out by our people with the help of local workers. The management, technical installations, and materials all came from Italy. We can combine our operations here with the company's central operations in Italy in terms of getting all the provisions we need. Overall, everything you see on our project sites was built by us, right down to the aluminum frames used on the windows. We even have a large machine in Almaty for cutting granite, as Kazakhstan is a big granite producer and it seems logical to have that capacity locally. We cut and we sell, simple. The quick development of the Kazakhstani economy and production sector allows us to trust a large number of local sub-contractors that are able to guarantee the high level of quality that we expect.</p><h4>Do you see room for building materials manufacturing to grow now that the government wants to diversify the country's industrial base?</h4><p>Yes, I believe there is a bountiful opportunity for the diversification of the industrial base. There is definitely enough space for more factories in the construction materials sector. The most important thing to concentrate on is infrastructure in terms of railways and roads, as well as pipelines. This kind of development will open the way for more factories to be opened.</p><h4>What changes have you seen in the business environment over the past few years?</h4><p>I have observed significant improvement since 1994, and even since 2004. The authorities have a positive mentality, and there has been a real push in order to see this country take advantage of its bountiful natural resources. In Soviet times the Kazakhstani economy was built on heavy industry, but now SMEs are the name of the game.</p><h4>How do you see Kazakhstan growing over the coming years?</h4><p>This country has a great presence and a bright future, not just because of the continued strength of the oil and gas sector. Unlike Europe, impressive economic growth rates have been recorded in recent years despite the economic crisis, and that is something I expect to continue into the future should certain challenges be met with action. Improved infrastructure, for example, should pave the way for an increased population.</p><h4>What are your thoughts regarding the diversification of Renco's activities?</h4><p>Our business model is highly elastic, and we are always on the lookout for new areas to move into. It really depends on the flow of the market and our own strengths. Our future lies mainly in construction. However, as we have established a strong name for ourselves here, I see no reason why we won't develop more of a presence in the oil and gas sector too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1958, Shymkentcement became a part of the Italcementi (ITC) Group in 1998. How has Shymkentcement's production benefited from ITC's expertise and excellence?</h4><p>After the acquisition of Shymkentcement and until today, ITC Group has invested around ‚¬42 million in its plant facilities on safety, the environment, and cost-reduction projects. The most important investment, carried out in 2009, was the installation of two completely new filters for kiln gas de-dusting. Shymkentcement is the only cement plant in Kazakhstan boasting these modern filters. Currently, the emission level is around four times less than the local required limits. These days we are trying to complete another investment project regarding Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM), which will be put into operation at the end of July 2011. There are many other projects ongoing at Shymkentcement, such as the installation of a pelletizer, a cement loading system, and so on. Those projects are set to be completed in 2011.</p><h4>Shymkentcement has a wide range of products. For which products do you experience the highest demand?</h4><p>Shymkentcement's product quality is controlled by integrated management system ISO 9001, certified by the AFNOR Certification Company. We also have nine types of products certified by GOST (local) standards, and one very special product called oil well cement used in oil production. This product is certified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and controlled by ITC's central laboratory. Our main competitive advantage in being a part of a multinational company is using the ITC trade name and selling high-quality products to our valued customers. Our main products are D20 and D80, and they make up most of our production. In addition to that, we are enlarging our storage facilities in regional areas to enlarge our market coverage. We currently have two terminals in Almaty with a storage capacity of 5,000 tons. It helps us to deliver cement to our customers on time.</p><h4>What are the strongest segments your company is involved in, and in which segments are you planning to increase volumes?</h4><p>Construction investment can be divided into three categories: civil engineering, residential investment, and non-residential investment. In 2011 two new players—one local and one international—entered the market. We expect that by 2015 overall cement capacity should increase by 4.4 million tons, reaching 13 million tons with four new plants. The 2009-2011 period will be remembered for its years of outstanding results—when Shymkentcement considerably strengthened its leading position in the market by opening its “Bravo Build" distribution centers with a new formula, “From Producers to Consumers". “Bravo Build" consists of retail shops that allow end-users to buy products directly from Shymkentcement. We have already opened three retail shops: one is located near the plant, the second is in Shymkent city center, and the third is in Mankent.</p><div class="quote">“The construction sector is the locomotive of the industry and decreases the unemployment rate considerably."</div><h4>How have your operations been affected by the recent economic downturn? What changes are you observing as market conditions improve?</h4><p>During the crisis of 2008 cement consumption in Kazakhstan decreased by 28% over 2007, and in 2009 the growth was down 10% on 2008. However, in 2010 the market recovered again and responded positively with a growth level of 10% over the 2009 results. In Kazakhstan most of the cement processes are wet systems and new plants under construction will have dry process designs. Shymkentcement is also considering such an investment, and it is under discussion with our shareholders. Therefore, we think that the wet process plants will experience difficulties in gaining a competitive advantage in the future, mainly due to the cost difference, and either the wet process plants will switch to dry process or they will lose their market share.</p><h4>What role will the construction materials sector play in widening Kazakhstan's industrial base?</h4><p>The construction sector is the locomotive of the industry and decreases the unemployment rate considerably. The Business Road Map 2020 is a good plan to boost the construction and building materials sector even further. One challenging issue is infrastructure, i.e. the weak transportation network in the country. Today we are facing a lot of problems in finding trucks to transport raw materials and finished products. We realize that the country is big, and it is difficult to transport cement from one part of the country to another, making it very costly. Therefore, if extensive transportation investment is realized, we believe that it will help the country develop.</p><h4>How has Shymkentcement worked toward improving innovation?</h4><p>ITC has an innovation department and every country management team has innovation objectives. Innovation means developing new processes in order to limit energy and raw material consumption, and creating new products in order to meet the needs of the market and the environment. An innovation ratio is determined by comparing total industrial turnover to each innovative action or product introduced. This displays how much significance we attach to innovation in our group and the company. We have many innovative products. For example, oil well cement is one of them. Pelletized cement is another innovative technique that we will introduce to the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the future of the agriculture sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Taking into consideration the rapidly changing world, Kazakhstan has strong prospects to rank number one in grain and livestock production worldwide. Analysis suggests the world's population will double by 2050, meaning that within 50 years farmers from all over the world will have to produce more than has been produced in the last 10,000 years combined. Due to the potential cultivating area of more than 25 million hectares, Kazakhstan has the chance to be among the agricultural powers that will play a considerable role in the food supply security of our planet in the future. The main peculiarity of agriculture in Kazakhstan is the big differentiation in farm sizes: from small farms with less than 1 hectare in area to gigantic farms with up to 1 million hectares of cultivating area that have no analogues in the world. In addition, Kazakhstan has the possibility to grow almost all types of crops, which can guarantee food supply security, and this reveals the true export potential of the country. Aside from plant cultivation, Kazakhstan has infinite possibilities for producing and processing animal products of the highest quality. It should be mentioned that despite the slow pace of renewal for machinery and the tractor fleet, Kazakhstani farmers are eager to apply new advanced technologies and are ready to embrace changes and innovations. For example, Kazakhstan is one of the leaders in applying precise soil cultivation systems—such as John Deere's Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS)—whereby all machinery is equipped with navigation and control of production process systems.</p><h4>What is your main client base in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our customers are all farmers in Kazakhstan, whether small, medium, or large in size, employing different levels of technology. We can offer complete solutions for every crop, climatic zone, and level of agriculture business.</p><h4>How has the world economic crisis affected agriculture in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the crisis had a negative effect on our business. Over 2009 and 2010 our sales volume decreased two or three fold compared to 2008, when the company witnessed a peak in sales. However, we are optimistic for 2011. The period from 2000 to 2008 saw the steady and fast-paced growth of investments in Kazakhstan's agriculture sector, both from the state and foreign financial institutions. The specific effects that were seen included termination on a timely basis by foreign export credit agencies, which halted investments into all segments of the economy—including agriculture. Furthermore, the cost of financing was raised considerably either on floating capital, or investment activity (up 20% a year). To compound matters, investment in machinery and tractor facilities was cut, and the implementation of modern technologies slowed. Today, the only sources of investment into agriculture are the structural departments of KazAgro National Managerial Holding, such as KazAgroFinance, Agro Credit Corporation, and KazAgroOnym, which has the possibility to invest a proper budget, and third-party funds with lower operating costs. Nevertheless, the budget and proper funds are limited and allocated to a wide-ranging program in a few spheres such as drip irrigation, greenhouses, poultry farms, and so on. This does not allow the sector to meet its needs for machinery and tractor facilities.</p><h4>What is your relationship with international manufacturer John Deere?</h4><p>The John Deere Company is the greatest manufacturer of agricultural equipment in the world. To be a representative of such a company is a great honor and responsibility for us. At the time the deal was signed, the John Deere brand was not popular and well known enough in Kazakhstan in comparison with other equipment suppliers, which at that very moment had been known on the market for 3-5 years already. That is why from the very beginning we understood that there were a lot of suppliers with whom our potential customers had been working for several years, and we would need to find our own customers. We had a premium class product, due to which we were able to position ourselves in the market as not just a seller of “iron", but a supplier of intellectual technologies and complete solutions in the sphere of agriculture. With such an approach we  succeeded in demonstrating the advantages of John Deere equipment and became a sales leader in the premium segment over the following three years.</p><h4>What are the secrets behind the success of Eurasia Group?</h4><p>If we speak of our success, our key assets are our employees. Our people are our power. We are very proud of the fact that we have managed to find a team in which the energy of the youth, and the experience of adults are combined. We are a team of professionals with the same visions, combined with the drive to implement the latest technologies and produce the best work possible to further agricultural development in Kazakhstan. Today, we can see that Eurasia Group has achieved a lot, but we have big plans for regional outlet development, after-sales service, and spare parts supply. Our aim is to improve availability for all customers and to better understand their needs and requirements.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the agricultural sector in Kazakhstan over the coming decade?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has great potential. I am sure that in the next 5-10 years one cannot imagine agriculture in Kazakhstan without satellite systems, electronic maps, online monitoring, and differentiated seed application systems. In the near future, thanks to the efforts of our country's President Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan will adopt all the latest innovative technologies in agriculture. We foresee an increase in development in the meat and dairy livestock breeding sectors. This considerable role will be given to the southern regions of our country. Such agricultural branches as gardening, cotton, rice, soybean, corn, and sunflower growing will be actively developed. More advanced irrigation systems will grow in popularity, especially drip irrigation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the past 20 years the transport infrastructure of Kazakhstan has undergone significant change. Not only have there been structural changes in transport infrastructure, certain measures have also been implemented concerning the modernization and optimization of the structure and management of transportation processes and the financial recovery of the industry. Economic liberalization and structural reforms in the transport sector have led to the development of a free market for transport services and their integration into Kazakhstan's developing market economy, changing the regulatory framework and transport management systems. Domestic competition is increasing between the road and air transport sectors, while inter-industry competition is seen primarily between road and rail, and rail and water transport. Additionally, competition with foreign carriers for the development of transport service markets is also increasing. Furthermore, a government resolution approved a new state transport policy. The main priorities stated in the resolution are the formation and development of a modern national transportation infrastructure, and the development of transportation infrastructure in western Kazakhstan, accelerating the integration of Kazakhstan's transport sector into the international transport system, developing the transit potential of the country, improving state regulations, and developing a competitive environment. Kazakhstan's transport complex is represented by rail, road, air, and water transport.<br></p><p>Currently, rail transport is characterized by high capacity in the transportation of goods and passengers over long distances. The republican state enterprise Kazakhstan Temir Zholy at the moment consists of nine subsidiaries. Since 1991 the structure of freight transported by rail has changed. Traditionally, the main products have been coal, various ores, grain, oil, and so on. The proportion of fuel and energy goods since 2000 has been increasing, and the key financial indicators for rail transport have been improving. The dynamic development of foreign trade increased cargo flows between Europe and Asia, leading to the formation of the Northern Corridor, Trans-Asian Railway, and the Central Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA). In this concept, the modernization of the main railway stations and the reconstruction of production facilities for the repair of rolling stock has continued. In order to maintain the transition to modern transport technology and to modernize the railways, up-to-date management information systems and an automated information network will be introduced. Following rail, road transport is an important part of the industrial infrastructure of the country. Road transport, as well as other forms of transport, has undergone organizational and structural changes in the period of economic reforms, which initially reduced its economic activity. In the late 1990s, the industry was subject to extensive privatization, which led to an increase in traffic volumes. The development of new businesses created the opportunity to acquire vehicles for individuals as private property and obtain licenses for commercial traffic. Serious structural changes in civil aviation were adequately reflected in the state of air transport. Based on international practice, a classical model of air transport was established, composed of three independent structures: air carriers, airports, and single service organizations (providers) and air traffic control.</p><h4>2000-2010</h4><p>In this period, one of the most important factors in economic growth was the rapid development and improvement of transport infrastructure. Since 2000, work has been ongoing to maintain positive trends in the implementation of transportation sector reforms. A competitive environment was created to accelerate the integration of Kazakhstan's transport sector into the international transport system and to develop the country's transit potential. The strategic role of transport has significantly increased and mutual ties between the task of its development and socio-economic transformation priorities strengthened. In general, transport grew to meet the growing demand for passenger and freight transport. Between 2000 and 2009 the transport sector experienced a 1.5 fold increase in the transport of passengers and a 2.1 fold increase in freight. Cargo and passenger turnover increased by 2.5 and 2 times respectively. A legal basis for the transport industry answering to the new socio-economic conditions was created. The functions of government and business were separated and market conditions for the adequate state regulation of transport activity were created. Since 2006 the aim has been the rapid development of transport and communication complexes that are capable of fully meeting the transportation needs of the economy and population. Furthermore, industry programs in the road sector, civil aviation, and water transport sector were accepted, and a number of regulations aimed at developing transport and communications complexes were also made.</p><div class="quote">“President Nazarbayev has set the task of achieving sustainable economic growth through rapid industrialization and infrastructure development."</div><h4>CONCRETE STEPS</h4><p>President Nazarbayev has set the task of achieving sustainable economic growth through rapid industrialization and infrastructure development. Kazakhstan's 2020 development plan defines the main directions of transport development, such as increasing the efficiency and integration of the four basic components of transport infrastructure: rail, road, air, and water. In pursuit of this aim, in 2010 a sectoral development program for transport infrastructure was adopted for the 2010-2014 period. The program has commenced and will implement 58 infrastructure projects totaling KZT2.8 trillion, KZT1.1 trillion of which has been allocated from the state budget. The main objective of the program is to achieve growth in gross value-added for transport by 63%, from KZT1,334.5 billion in 2009 to KZT2,175.2 billion.</p><h4>PPP</h4><p>The involvement of private capital (international or Kazakhstani) in the financing and development of transport infrastructure is due to the need to reduce the financial burden on the state budget. The implementation of concession projects improves the investment climate and prospects for external borrowing in Kazakhstan in general. Concession projects are widely used in both developed and developing countries to improve economic growth, car ownership, and hence the intensity on the roads and the interest of the private sector, including multinational companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your grain export portfolio, and where are your main markets?<br></h4><p>Through the Baltic Sea, we export to the Middle East, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. We also produce wheat for export to Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Kazakhstan exports flour to countries such as Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, which represent our largest markets, and is also the number one exporter of flour in the world. Our exports to European clients depend on the price, but Central Asian countries only buy Kazakhstani wheat.</p><h4>What effect will the Customs Union have on the grain trade?</h4><p>It will have a negative impact on dairy, meat, and certain other products, because of the high subsidies in the Customs Union, with which Kazakhstani producers cannot compete. Competition in cereal production will increase minimally.</p><h4>What is Kazakhstan's export potential to the Chinese market?</h4><p>China is the future market. Approximately 80% of Kazakhstan's cereal production comes from three regions that are close to the Russian border, and these three areas represent 95% of Kazakhstan's exports. In December 2011, the Iranian and Kazakhstani railway networks will be connected through Turkmenistan. Central Asia, Iran, and the Gulf are the main Kazakhstani markets right now, but in respect to the Chinese market, approximately 97% of China's population lives far from Kazakhstan's border. West China currently provides its own wheat for domestic consumption. In the future, however, the Chinese government wants to move 150 million people closer to the Kazakhstani border, and this will happen over the next 20 years. The Chinese market is not our priority now, but in 20 years it will become our largest market for wheat.</p><h4>What is your involvement with the Grain Union of Kazakhstan?</h4><p>After the government lifted the monopoly on the grain trade in 1992, private grain exporters emerged in Kazakhstan. To protect their interests, these private companies created the “Association of Exporters of Corn," which in 1995 was renamed the “Grain Union of Kazakhstan". I have headed this organization since 1998 as its president. Reduced state funding for agriculture led to a sharp decrease in cultivated lands in Kazakhstan. In 1998 private exporters were unable to buy enough grain for export due to the lack of a free grain market. In 1999, these companies began to invest in grain production by renting land and buying containers for grain storage. Members of the Grain Union of Kazakhstan are vertically structured private companies. They produce grain and oilseed on state property leased for 49 years. They also conduct the modernization of agricultural technology, employing US, Canadian, and EU machinery, and have storage and processing capacities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan still remains relatively unknown to the international tourism industry. How are you looking to increase the country's visibility as a tourism destination?</h4><p>Since independence, Kazakhstan has successfully conducted domestic reforms that have allowed for relatively high and stable growth in the national economy. Today, Kazakhstan is faced with the challenge of making its tourism sector as profitable as its oil sector. In this regard, the government is actively working to develop tourism infrastructure in Kazakhstan, and work is being conducted in all regions of the country. In addition, a lot of work is being done to attract foreign tourists to Kazakhstan and increase the investment attractiveness of the country.</p><h4>What figures did Kazakhstan experience over 2010 in terms of visitor numbers?</h4><p>According to the Kazakhstan Statistics Agency, in 2010 the number of tourists was 4.7 million and increased by 8.8% compared with 2009. Over the year there was an increase in tourism from all areas, namely domestic, business, and personal. The number of outbound tourists also jumped to 7.4 million, compared to 6.4 million in 2009. Domestic tourist figures also jumped by 10% to 4.5 million, and the total value of services increased by 11% to reach KZT73.1 billion. The number of beds also increased to 76,053, up from 67,717 in 2009—a 12.3% increase. In 2010, investments in the tourism industry also grew by 58.3% compared with 2009 and amounted to KZT194.6 billion</p><h4>What steps is the government taking on easing visa procedures?</h4><p>The Ministry of Tourism and Sports and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will hold a meeting in the near future with the consuls of the Schengen area, during which issues will be discussed to simplify visa procedures for Kazakhstani citizens planning to visit Europe, and to simplify visa formalities for citizens of the Schengen zone traveling to Kazakhstan.</p><h4>In the recent past Kazakhstan hosted various major international conferences, such as the OSCE Summit, with many more lined up for 2011. How have these conferences contributed to the profile of Kazakhstan as a Eurasian center of attraction for international MICE gatherings?</h4><p>Holding conferences, forums, exhibitions, and other activities in Kazakhstan has a positive effect on the country's image around the world. Similar events are held at high levels and with the participation of representatives of many countries, most of whom had not previously visited our country. Given the rich experience of the country in various activities, Kazakhstan has already formed a positive image and credibility in the eyes of world public opinion. In recent years, Kazakhstan has carried out such extensive and important events as the Summit of the OSCE, 18th General Assembly of the World Tourism Organization, the Fourth Astana Economic Forum, the Asian Winter Games, and others that were visited by large numbers of people, many of whom are interested in Kazakhstan as a partner for business or as a tourist destination.</p><h4>How is your Ministry looking to actively protect and promote Kazakhstan's natural and historic sites of beauty?</h4><p>It is known that the tourist potential of Kazakhstan is rich, diverse, and has unique opportunities for the development of almost all types of domestic tourism, from cultural and historical visits to adventure and other active types of tourism. The country has more than 9,000 archaeological and historical sites. In addition, there are 118 protected areas in the country, including 11 national natural parks where camping is allowed, aimed at developing eco-tourism.</p><h4>How is the Ministry planning to promote the use of some of the facilities built for the recent Asian Winter Games as tourism destinations?</h4><p>The government aims to hold international competitions used by the Asian Games to promote the tourism sector in the country, and in 2011 we plan to hold the Speed Skating World Cup, as well as the Cycling World Cup at the Republican Cycle Track. Furthermore, in 2010 the mountainous skating rink Medeo in Almaty is scheduled to host the Bandy World Championships. These activities will positively promote the tourism industry and attract sports fans from around the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of tourism in the new decade?</h4><p>The tourism sector will continue to grow in line with development of the economy and its infrastructure. A tourism cluster will be created along the Western China-Western Europe transportation corridor, and tourist centers and complexes will be a main target for development. We will also build on current strengths and develop ski tourism infrastructure, as well as develop marketing strategies and human resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Foreign investments constitute the most significant part of the economic activity of different countries. Kazakhstan plays a major role in the Central Asian region. It has great potential for investors. The main sectors for investments are subsoil use and energy. I would like to turn attention to the main issues surrounding the legal regulation of investment activity in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's investments policy is based on the concepts of stability and certainty, equal conditions for all investors (both local and foreign), and protection of investors' rights and interests and the creation of a favorable climate for foreign investments. The main characteristics of making investments in Kazakhstan are not only the huge natural resources, but also skilled staff, a stable political and economic situation, and lucrative location.</p><p>Investments in Kazakhstan are regulated by international conventions (Kazakhstan ratified the Seoul Convention on Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency dated 1985 and the Moscow Convention on the Protection of Investor Rights dated 1997) and specific domestic laws oriented to the stimulation of increasing investments, the guarantee of investor's rights, and the protection of their interests.</p><p>Nevertheless, the work of the government in all spheres of national economy, development of priority branches, and realization of new projects allows Kazakhstan to remain attractive for foreign investments. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan, stands strongly for business development with the inclusion of foreign investors. There are at least six Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Kazakhstan, including Astana, Borabay, Seaport Aktau, Ontustik, a park of information technologies, and the National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark.</p><p>The other benefit for foreign investors in Kazakhstan is that the country follows international treaties, for example in the tax sphere, which is very important for foreign investors. Kazakhstan is party to more than 35 double tax treaties with various countries, which generally follow the OECD Model Income Tax Convention. Ratified double tax treaties prevail over the Tax Code of Kazakhstan, and shall apply according to the provisions of internal legislation and the treaty itself.</p><p>There is also a Foreign Investors' Council (FIC), which is convened annually or twice a year and headed by the President of Kazakhstan, which is an advisory body established with the purpose of promoting direct dialogue between the government of Kazakhstan and foreign investors in order to efficiently address key issues related to their investment activities and improve the investment climate for the benefit of foreign investors. The FIC usually submits its recommendations for improvements upon deep analysis of the investment climate to the President and government of Kazakhstan. FIC members include the top management of different foreign organizations and foreign companies.</p><p>Disputes between investors may be solved by state courts and also by arbitration procedures. Kazakhstan has joined International Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 1965 (ICSID Convention), which establishes the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes.</p><p>Also, Kazakhstani courts recognize arbitral awards. In December 2004 Kazakhstan adopted the Law on International Commercial Arbitration, which establishes that arbitral awards must be enforced according to common civil proceedings legislation and should not be reconsidered by courts. However, there are several (very limited) procedural grounds for reconsidering the arbitral award. As a result of all the mentioned developments, Kazakhstan is clearly the leader in terms of an investment environment in  the CIS.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have BASF's operations evolved in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>BASF is the world's leading chemical company, and considers itself the chemical company. BASF launched its business in Kazakhstan in 1992 in the agro-chemical industry by supplying crop-protection agents. The acquisition of a local construction chemical manufacturer gave a powerful boost to BASF's expansion in Kazakhstan by providing a basis for establishing a multi-purpose company that now offers the entire range of BASF products and services in Central Asia. Globally, its portfolio ranges from chemicals, plastics, performance products, and agricultural products to oil and gas. As a reliable partner, BASF creates chemistry to help its customers in virtually all industries to be more successful. With its high-value products and intelligent solutions, BASF plays an important role in finding answers to global challenges such as climate protection, energy efficiency, nutrition, and mobility. The year 2011 has been designated as the International Year of Chemistry (IYC) by the United Nations, and BASF is supporting the initiative in many different ways. I think BASF's strongest point is its excellent team, which really contributes to the company's success. At present, we are promoting projects in new sectors, particularly in the petrochemical and mining sectors, as well as heat insulation designs in the construction industry. These projects fit in a perfect manner to the country's diversification plans as well as to the aim of investing in climate protection. Today, with the focus on farmers and their needs, BASF wants to become a key player in the agricultural industry.</p><h4>BASF has a wide product portfolio. For which products do you have biggest demand?</h4><p>There is competition in all segments of our business, and it is a great motivation to perform our work better than others. It is in the construction chemicals and crop protection product areas that we see the most demand. We have two production sites in Almaty and Astana where we manufacture concrete admixture and dry mix additives. Nearly 80% of all construction chemical materials sold are produced locally. BASF supplies a wide range of crop protection products to Kazakhstan, and we focus our business on crops like wheat, oilseed rape, and fruits with fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides. We conduct our business in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and responsible care.</p><h4>What BASF innovations have contributed to the advancement of Kazakhstan's industrial base?</h4><p>First of all, BASF focuses on innovative technologies. In 2010, BASF's R&amp;D expenditure reached a new record level, rising to nearly ‚¬1.5 billion. Basically, all of our products have an innovative component, such as Neopor. Neopor insulates using air and graphite. With Neopor, BASF provides an insulating material that offers significantly better thermal insulation than other products that are currently available. For example, the new product can achieve the same insulating performance as BASF's classic Styropor, with up to 50% less raw materials used. For construction chemicals, BASF has developed a new “Crystal Speed Hardening" concept for contractors and precast producers, which increases productivity and quality in concrete production. It also helps to save time and has a positive impact on energy efficiency, offering an attractive overall cost saving potential. We are additionally a primary producer of acrylic dispersions for the paint and varnish industry.</p><div class="quote">“The financial year 2010 was both eventful and successful."</div><p>I also would like to mention our innovative solutions for crop protection. Using the Clearfield Production System (CPS) farmers can protect crops such as oilseed rape, corn, wheat, or rice from weeds for the entire growing season. The system is a combination of herbicides and seeds that are tolerant to these herbicides. The seeds are obtained using traditional breeding methods and don't use genetic engineering. The herbicide acts when it comes into direct contact with weeds, and a single application prevents weeds from germinating again throughout the entire growing season. With CPS, BASF has improved its competitiveness in the market for herbicide-tolerant systems—one of the fastest growing segments of the agricultural market. Another big field of interest in Kazakhstan is the oil, gas, and mining industry. BASF supplies a wide range of gas treatment technologies based on amines solutions for the purification of associated gases and liquid natural gases to the Kazakhstani oil and gas market. BASF makes every effort to ensure its customers have access to all innovative BASF products.</p><h4>How have your operations been affected by the recent economic downturn?</h4><p>The financial year 2010 was both eventful and successful. We took advantage of the strong economic upturn, and the result was record sales and solid earnings. We formed the best team in the industry. At the same time, we put BASF on the right track for our future success. Thanks to our acquisitions of Ciba and Cognis, as well as our innovations in future markets, we are becoming even stronger. We are therefore approaching the growing challenges of the future with confidence. This offers benefits for customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, and the public. All in all we are satisfied with our development. Nevertheless, to be the leading chemical company in the future, we certainly have to make all possible efforts.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2011 and beyond?</h4><p>I am convinced that the government will be able to achieve its strategic and macroeconomic objectives set for this year. All these aspects together will contribute to an overall stabilization of the economy and create high interest in real investors in order to develop projects here in Kazakhstan. According to current knowledge, we do not predict a further downturn in the economy within Kazakhstan. All indicators are showing a stable positive trend. However, we are also prepared for worst-case scenarios.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan is rapidly becoming the decision-making hub for many businesses in Central Asia. What is Kazakhstan's potential as a regional hub when it comes to science, education, and innovation?<br></h4><p>Kazakhstan is leading Central Asia in these areas due to the pace of reform. Kazakhstan actively develops students' academic mobility by annually allocating educational grants for students from the CIS region and elsewhere to study here—15,000 foreign students are enrolled at Kazakhstani educational institutions. The potential of scientific research in Kazakhstan is also contributing to our leading position in the region. Many Kazakhstani schools are recognized abroad in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and earth sciences. Currently, there are more than 400 scientific organizations, which have created six innovative educational groups, two of which are international. Together with the World Bank we have implemented a regional project that aims at commercializing scientific research through the introduction of scientific ideas into real sector production. Furthermore, our geography institute works not only as a regional but also as a global glaciological center under the auspices of UNESCO. All this contributes to the recognition of Kazakhstan's regional leadership in education, science, and innovation by the international community.</p><h4>What is the level of your cooperation with local and/or foreign actors from the private sector? How can such cooperation prove mutually beneficial?</h4><p>Consolidating the efforts of business and government should be one of the main levers in the technological modernization of the country and in developing its human capital. In pre-school education we are implementing the “Balapan" program in partnership with the private sector. This has led to an annual increase in the number of private kindergartens of 30%. Secondly, the National Council for the Development of Technical and Vocational Education (TIPO) is starting to work with sectoral and regional councils. Their task is to identify the needs of the labor market and to develop modern professional standards. We have also created the JSC Holding Kasipkor. Its main task is to develop a new model of corporate governance for TIPO with active business participation. We have gone to a new level of mutually advantageous cooperation between businesses and government, with a view to improving the quality of education in a competitive environment by increasing the social responsibility of businesses.</p><h4></h4><h4>Which research programs have received Ministry support and gone on to contribute to the development of the economy?</h4><p>The Supreme Science and Technology Commission determines priority areas of government support for research. Currently, the five priority areas are: energy, deep processing of raw materials and products, information and telecommunications technologies, life sciences, and the country's intellectual potential. Successful development in these areas will ensure that local science will attain world-class quality. In recent years, Kazakhstan has achieved significant international accomplishments in biotechnology, phyotochemistry, and nanotechnology. We have developed domestic mobile computers and information and communication systems for military technology. We also founded the breakthrough vaccine against swine flu A/H1N1, new drugs against tuberculosis and HIV based on nanotechnology, herbal treatment for diseases, and high-performance catalysts for oil refining. The Ministry has shown support for all of these projects, which have led to innovative projects such as the development of new technologies for aluminum ore production, plasma ignition technology for solid fuels at thermal power plants, the production of rhenium and osmium from uranium mining and copper production tailings, as well as the creation of new flame retardants.</p><div class="quote">“The 20th year of independence constitutes a milestone for the education system, as this year sees the most fundamental change."</div><h4>The Bolashak scholarship program constitutes an integral part of developing the country's brightest minds through education at the best schools worldwide.

What is Kazakhstan's potential as a regional hub when it comes to science, education, and innovation?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is leading Central Asia in these areas due to the pace of reform. Kazakhstan actively develops students' academic mobility by annually allocating educational grants for students from the CIS region and elsewhere to study here—15,000 foreign students are enrolled at Kazakhstani educational institutions. The potential of scientific research in Kazakhstan is also contributing to our leading position in the region. Many Kazakhstani schools are recognized abroad in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and earth sciences. Currently, there are more than 400 scientific organizations, which have created six innovative educational groups, two of which are international. Together with the World Bank we have implemented a regional project that aims at commercializing scientific research through the introduction of scientific ideas into real sector production. Furthermore, our geography institute works not only as a regional but also as a global glaciological center under the auspices of UNESCO. All this contributes to the recognition of Kazakhstan's regional leadership in education, science, and innovation by the international community.</p><h4>What is the level of your cooperation with local and/or foreign actors from the private sector?

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led to the establishment of a university dedicated to research and academic excellence in Astana?<br></h4><p>The goal of this international university is first to turn Astana into a regional education center, and second to bring our national education system up to international standards. The President of Kazakhstan is widely known for his commitment to higher education; for example, he launched the Bolashak program, which provides opportunities to thousands of young Kazakhstanis to obtain government scholarships and to study abroad at the world's most prestigious universities. This program does not have analogues in other CIS member states. For Nazarbayev University the model was selected in partnership and after consultations with other leading worldwide universities. I would not say that at Nazarbayev University we are creating an elite, stand-alone university; it is rather a model for higher education in Kazakhstan. We have 10 partners, and each of them is strategic for a particular academic program or for a particular research center. The partners are responsible for developing a school strategy, developing a curriculum, training local faculty members, and ensuring quality control. We had the first intake in fall 2010. For the first year Baccalaureate we adopted the UK-type foundation program in partnership with University College London (UCL). For us it is important to bring the graduates of secondary education up to international standards, with English proficiency, knowledge of science and research, and critical thinking skills. In 2012 we will open two graduate schools: a Graduate School of Business with Duke University and a Graduate School of Public Policy with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. So far we have three research centers: a Center for Energy Research, run jointly with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and Argonne National Lab, a Center for Life Sciences, run jointly with the University of Pittsburgh, and the International Interdisciplinary Instrumental Center. All the centers are linked to real industry. At Nazarbayev University we have an industrial council on which leading industrial companies in Kazakhstan are represented, and this council advises on the curriculum and offers internship programs, as well as participates in our research projects. The university also has governance up to international standards. One of the peculiarities at Nazarbayev University is academic independence. The Nazarbayev University Board of Trustees runs the university totally independently from the Ministry of Education and Science. This is a new approach for the CIS region.</p><h4>What are you doing to develop a competitive school of medicine?</h4><p>It is important that the university has an integrated healthcare program. The university is in touch with six big clinics in Astana, and we have a medical school that will operate with a triangular model: a medical school, a clinic, and a research center. There will be teaching, treatment, and research, and the students will be involved in all three entities. We have international partners helping us set up this system.</p><h4>What sort of financial arrangements have you offered students?</h4><p>Currently we have about 500 students from all the regions of Kazakhstan on full scholarship. The admission procedures were administered by UCL according to their admission standards. It means that our students could be admitted to UCL in London. So far all our students are on full scholarship, and the issue of tuition and fees is in the hands of the Nazarbayev University Board of Directors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main aims behind the creation of KIMEP and how has it evolved?<br></h4><p>The main task of this university was to help transform Kazakhstan from a state-run, socialist, Soviet-type economy into a free market economy, to implement privatization, to aid the development of the private sector, and to educate a new generation that could oversee and bring about this process. Back then, all assets, properties, and real estate were in the hands of the state. It was therefore a very challenging responsibility. Our first task was obviously to educate the people on privatization and to educate people who could take on this challenge. The President ordered the creation of KIMEP. Other universities and institutions in Europe, Canada, the US, France, the UK, and so on all helped out in our efforts financially and also technically through the provision of equipment, computers, as well as academic staff.</p><h4>How have you implemented new programs over the years?</h4><p>Demand changes over time. At one point we saw the need for a journalism program due to the low journalistic standards in the country, for example. Another example is the doctoral degree in business management, which was implemented because a lot of people had MBAs to become junior faculty members of universities, but didn't have access to a doctoral program. By offering PhDs to these junior faculty members they were able to keep moving up and could become fully fledged faculty members. It's a costly program, but it was necessary.</p><h4>How do you strike a balance between dedication to scientific standards, pragmatism, and the budget of the university?</h4><p>This is not a charity organization, and so we cannot just begin a course or program without it being financially viable. That being said, we're not out to make money, either. It's a balance that we seek. We need to educate as many as possible, while remaining economically viable. Also, we want to provide education that will also guarantee jobs. For example, our accounting program is very popular, and up to 80% of new recruitment at some of  the “Big Four" accounting firms in Almaty—KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young, PwC, and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu—are KIMEP graduates. KIMEP students command that kind of privilege. We also have many graduates working in other big companies like Proctor &amp; Gamble, the big multinational oil and gas companies, and so on. I can go on and on. KIMEP has a lot of prestige.</p><h4>Do you have scholarship programs for foreign students too?</h4><p>Yes, we offer up to 60 and we recently announced another 100 full merit scholarships planned for 2012 for incoming students from the other Central Asian republics: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. We feel that it is our responsibility as an institute dedicated to development in Central Asia. These students often prefer to stay abroad and work in multinationals because they wouldn't have the same chance for advancement or the same pay if they returned to their own countries. We also have the support of many Kazakhstani corporations that contribute up to $2 million for scholarship programs through KIMEP every year.</p><h4>What fields does KIMEP concentrate on?</h4><p>KIMEP is concerned mainly with business, law, and social sciences. Our aim is to fill in the parts of the education system that might be lacking in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How long has Bayer been in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>I've worked in the sector for around 18 years and Bayer has been in the market since Soviet times, since 1985 specifically. I joined Bayer in 2000. The best period for Bayer was from 2000 to 2010 as the whole country saw a period of rapid development—the agricultural sector in particular. It's been growing ever since and the market just keeps getting bigger and bigger.</p><h4>How is Bayer positioned in the sector?</h4><p>There are many strong international brands in the country; Bayer isn't the only one. However, in terms of turnover, it has been the market leader in Kazakhstan since 2003.</p><h4>How have you seen the agriculture sector change?</h4><p>In the post-Soviet era, the agriculture sector transformed dramatically, with small farming companies becoming big companies. Large private grain companies are very important in developing and introducing more advanced agricultural technology, machinery, and chemistry. The latest data shows that yields have been increasing, and also that crop protection has improved. The trend is now moving toward oil seeds. There's also more interest in agro-technology on fallow land.</p><h4>How has the government's role changed in the sector?</h4><p>The government has played a significant role by awarding subsidies to farming companies that use high-level technologies. The government continued to support the sector from 2008 to 2010 during the crisis.</p><p>We had a good yield in 2009, but unfortunately the prices were low. At that stage the government bought wheat at a higher price that it was on the market. This development period, through our innovative products, allowed us to adapt the latest pesticides to boost yields.</p><h4>How do pesticides support the innovation strategy and contribute to the production of quality foodstuffs in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Pesticides in Kazakhstan are very innovative, very safe ecologically, and are easily used. In terms of spending on research in new technologies, Bayer is one of the agricultural sector's biggest companies. At our headquarters in Germany there's a lot of research being done on developing and adding new active ingredients to pesticides. We also put a lot of effort into educating farmers on technological and educational issues. It's expensive, but worthwhile.</p><h4>What sort of education do you provide?</h4><p>During winter—the low season—we have large-scale seminars in planting regions where we give information on our products, technology, and experience. We teach farmers how to use and implement our products.</p><h4>What is your product portfolio?</h4><p>In cereals we have a full portfolio covering seed treatment, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. Our total product portfolio consists of more than 30 products.</p><h4>What issues need to be addressed in the sector and what challenges stand out in terms of the development of the Kazakhstani agricultural sector, both in terms of livestock and grains?</h4><p>By 2010, many farmers and big companies were able to re-equip. It was a difficult year nevertheless, because of the liquidity crunch, but they overcame that period and companies will continue to grow. As for livestock, it's still developing, but there are strong efforts by the government to develop that sector.</p><h4>What do you believe gives Kazakhstan's agricultural sector a competitive advantage over other countries?</h4><p>Quality. Our protein content in grain is the highest. There is an element of high-risk related to yield potential due to the rough climate conditions in our country, but our yield is very high quality. Canada has similar climate conditions to Kazakhstan.</p><p>In 2001, 2003, and 2008, Bayer organized trips for chief agronomists to exchange their experiences. When these chief agronomists came back they began to change their technology to comply with Canadian technology. Canada has extensive experience with crop production in harsh weather conditions, and its technology is suited to Kazakhstan.</p><p>Additionally, Kazakhstan is a multinational country. Different cultures and people live together quite happily here. Kazakhstanis are by nature very hospitable and friendly. This goes back a long way, I think.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY talks to Beibit Moldashev, Head of Bayer CropScience Kazakhstan, on the potential of both the local agricultural sector and the Customs Union.</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4>TBY How long has Bayer been in Kazakhstan?</h4>
<p>BEIBIT MOLDASHEV I’ve worked in the sector for around 18 years and Bayer has been in the market since Soviet times, since 1985 specifically. I joined Bayer in 2000. The best period for Bayer was from 2000 to 2010 as the whole country saw a period of rapid development—the agricultural sector in particular. It’s been growing ever since and the market just keeps getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<h4>How is Bayer positioned in the sector?</h4>
<p>There are many strong international brands in the country; Bayer isn’t the only one. However, in terms of turnover, it has been the market leader in Kazakhstan since 2003.</p>
<h4>How have you seen the agriculture sector change?</h4>
<p>In the post-Soviet era, the agriculture sector transformed dramatically, with small farming companies becoming big companies. Large private grain companies are very important in developing and introducing more advanced agricultural technology, machinery, and chemistry. The latest data shows that yields have been increasing, and also that crop protection has improved. The trend is now moving toward oil seeds. There’s also more interest in agro-technology on fallow land.</p>
<h4>How has the government’s role changed in the sector?</h4>
<p>The government has played a significant role by awarding subsidies to farming companies that use high-level technologies. The government continued to support the sector from 2008 to 2010 during the crisis. We had a good yield in 2009, but unfortunately the prices were low. At that stage the government bought wheat at a higher price that it was on the market. This development period, through our innovative products, allowed us to adapt the latest pesticides to boost yields.</p>
<h4>How do pesticides support the innovation strategy and contribute to the production of quality foodstuffs in Kazakhstan?</h4>
<p>Pesticides in Kazakhstan are very innovative, very safe ecologically, and are easily used. In terms of spending on research in new technologies, Bayer is one of the agricultural sector’s biggest companies. At our headquarters in Germany there’s a lot of research being done on developing and adding new active ingredients to pesticides. We also put a lot of effort into educating farmers on technological and educational issues. It’s expensive, but worthwhile.</p>
<h4>What sort of education do you provide?</h4>
<p>During winter—the low season—we have large-scale seminars in planting regions where we give information on our products, technology, and experience. We teach farmers how to use and implement our products.</p>
<h4>What is your product portfolio?</h4>
<p>In cereals we have a full portfolio covering seed treatment, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. Our total product portfolio consists of more than 30 products.</p>
<p>What issues need to be addressed in the sector and what challenges stand out in terms of the development of the Kazakhstani agricultural sector, both in terms of livestock and grains?</p>
<p>By 2010, many farmers and big companies were able to re-equip. It was a difficult year nevertheless, because of the liquidity crunch, but they overcame that period and companies will continue to grow. As for livestock, it’s still developing, but there are strong efforts by the government to develop that sector.</p>
<h4>What do you believe gives Kazakhstan’s agricultural sector a competitive advantage over other countries?</h4>
<p>Quality. Our protein content in grain is the highest. There is an element of high-risk related to yield potential due to the rough climate conditions in our country, but our yield is very high quality. Canada has similar climate conditions to Kazakhstan. In 2001, 2003, and 2008, Bayer organized trips for chief agronomists to exchange their experiences. When these chief agronomists came back they began to change their technology to comply with Canadian technology. Canada has extensive experience with crop production in harsh weather conditions, and its technology is suited to Kazakhstan. Additionally, Kazakhstan is a multinational country. Different cultures and people live together quite happily here. Kazakhstanis are by nature very hospitable and friendly. This goes back a long way, I think. The steppe was enormous, but gossip traveled fast, which means you had to always treat your guests well, otherwise they wouldn’t treat you well when you needed it. This hospitality and friendliness is a part of our culture. Other strengths of Kazakhstan include the fact that the country is politically stable and investments are secured and guaranteed by the government. There is still a lot of land to be developed, especially in the central areas of the country, and so the sector still has plenty of room for real growth.</p>
<h4>Do you import products from Germany?</h4>
<p>Yes, we import products from factories in Germany and France in January, March, and May. In our 10 years of experience we’ve never had a delay in importing these products.</p>
<h4>What options are available for foreign investors in the Kazakhstani agricultural sector?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of options for investors in Kazakhstan. One is as a joint venture with existing companies that have a financing capital structure. If you are confident enough, then another way is to enter Kazakhstan alone and start a business.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is a good place for production, and all the existing companies have been growing healthily over the years. A lot of machinery companies that made profits in their first years have created joint venture funds with which they have been investing in the agricultural sector.</p>
<h4>What plans do you have for production?</h4>
<p>Bayer in Kazakhstan has been producing pesticides with its partners since 2003, and we plan to expand that. Potentially, everything we import could be locally produced here in Kazakhstan. We would produce mainly for local consumption.</p>
<p>The Customs Union enacted between Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan is crucial, and we are waiting to see how that situation develops. After that we can build a platform on how to work for the buyer in terms of product price and marketing. That will all be synchronized between those three countries. We’re ready for any outcome.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's foreign trade expectations index rose by 11.4 basis points from October of 2010 through January. What is your outlook for trade growth in 2011?<br></h4><p>Parallel to developments during the recovery process of the global economy, recent improvements have been recorded in the Turkish economy. As a result of the precautions implemented in order to lessen the negative effects of the global crisis on Turkey, successful figures have been achieved in export and import rates.</p><p>Right after the crisis, booming export rates were achieved thanks to the outstanding economic performance of the country in 2010. In comparison to the previous year, there has been a 23.1% increase in the foreign trade rate, reaching $302.4 billion. The total value of exports was $113.9 billion, an 11.5% increase, whereas imports increased by 31.6%, reaching $188.5 billion. Due to the steady increase in import rates, there has been a decrease in the import coverage of exports.</p><p>Starting from the beginning of the 1980s, import substitution industrialization strategies were abandoned in order to open the economy up more to international markets. With these reforms implemented, the government aimed to establish a free market economy that would be better integrated with the world economy. Recently, the volume of exports has become one of the most powerful tools of the national economy. However, exports are going through important restructuring processes parallel to the transformations in the Turkish economy in general. In regards to developments in industry, the focal point of exports has started to move away from traditional sectors to technology-oriented sectors.</p><p>For the forthcoming years, it can be said that economic policies and precautions will be implemented in light of the needs of our growth strategy based on exports. In this context, stable growth rates are expected in 2011 for the world economy as well as Turkey. A medium-term program has been launched that aims to ensure sustainable economic growth, defined as export-oriented, for the upcoming years. Forecasts for foreign trade assume that the total value of exports will reach $160 billion by end-2013. For 2011, it is expected that the total value of exports will reach $127 billion, whereas imports are estimated to hit $199.5 billion. I strongly believe that we will soon achieve export figures higher than the $132 billion achieved in 2008.</p><h4>How has Turkey's “zero problems" foreign policy outlook with its neighbors influenced regional trade?</h4><p>Turkey's export success depends on nurturing its deepening relations with neighboring countries, with which we share a certain geography, culture, and tradition. For this reason, in order to achieve more success in the future, a market diversification strategy in exports and the encouragement of foreign companies to enter new markets play a significant role. Considering the highly competitive market conditions, the orientation of exporters to the various markets is crucial if we are to reach our targets.</p><p>Turkey has been implementing a foreign policy that aims for zero problems with its neighbors in order to establish more fruitful economic cooperation. In line with these foreign policy objectives, the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade has been conducting diplomacy with a motto of “zero problems, unlimited trade" in cooperation with the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Establishing long-term cultural, economic, and political relations lie at the center of our foreign trade policies.</p><p>In the last few years, we have achieved remarkable success in our relations with neighbors and periphery countries. For instance, the total value of exports with neighbors and periphery countries will reach $49 billion in 2010, a figure that was only $9.3 billion in 2002. Similarly, the total value of imports increased to $60.7 billion, higher than the number recorded in 2002 of $12.8 billion. According to these numbers, the market share of exports with neighbors and periphery countries in overall exports will increase 43%.</p><p>In the January-December 2010 period, our exports to neighbors and periphery countries increased by 14%, reaching $49.2 billion, compared with the same period in the previous year. As for export rates, there has been a 34% increase, reaching $60.7 billion in comparison to the previous year. Looking back on relations with our neighbors in terms of foreign trade, our export rates were $5.4 billion with the Caucasus, $7.2 billion with the Balkans, and $17 billion with the Middle East in 2010. It is understood that there has been a 23% increase in comparison to the same period in 2009.</p><h4>Even before the global financial crisis, your Ministry initiated a strategy to diversify into new foreign trade markets. With which countries do you expect the most trade growth?</h4><p>I am very proud that, despite the global financial crisis, the Turkish economy has managed to maintain its export rates at over $100 billion. To achieve these objectives, Turkey has been pursuing policies to diversify its market and its products. In this regard, I would like to emphasize the fact that a special priority has been placed on exports based on medium-term projections. Currently, we are working closely with our exporters to develop a 2023 Plan. One of the main aims of the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade is to diversify exports in geographic and sector-specific terms. Therefore, our headquarters and international offices are conducting comprehensive research about possible developments in international markets. Within the context of these information sources, our experts analyze the potential data and inform exporters about opportunities abroad.</p><p>In regards to our forecasts derived from our market-oriented research, the US, China, Russia, India, Brazil, Jordan, Nigeria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar were defined as the target countries for 2011. In 2010, overall exports were increased by a moderate 11.5%, while this figure rose to 20% in target countries' exports. Our export rates to China and Canada increased by 20% and 58%, respectively.</p><h4>Which sectors do you feel have the most potential for Turkey's external trade?</h4><p>Recent changing trends in production and consumption in national economies led to a qualitative as well as a quantitative transformation during the 2000s. As for production, the main motivators have become high technology and branding. We attach great importance to producing authentic designs, creating value-added, and keeping in line with EU standards.</p><p>Looking at recent developments in the world, production and profit moved away from the sectors that rely on labor-intensive industries such as textiles and agriculture to new technology-oriented sectors such as automotive, mining, and chemicals. Electronic products have also been prioritized among the upcoming sectors.</p><p>On the other hand, one of the main problems in the world is the loss of water and energy resources. To be more precise, the problem of energy is a barrier standing in front of world economic growth. Thus, I firmly believe that as a result of the ongoing problems relating to water, food, and energy resources, alternative energy resource developments will profoundly affect potential investments.</p><p>In terms of technology-oriented sectors, Turkey has been striving hard to achieve its aims with the cooperation of the public and private sectors. In Turkey, there have been important investments and technology transfers in the sector. Our main objective is to increase our export rates, which are currently 3.2% for high-technology products and 29.7% for middle-technology products. Additionally, in this globalized world, exporters should carefully follow the trends in technology and design competitive products for the international market. In this context, Turkey has been developing itself in the defense, automotive, and machine industry sectors to become an export center.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the performance of Turkish economy in 2011 and beyond?</h4><p>It is highly expected that our national economy will keep growing thanks to the improvements in the economy in 2010. Over that year, Turkey's economy grew by 4.4%, higher than IMF expectations in its updated report, and in 2012 a growth rate of 4.5% is anticipated. In the same report, it is stated that there will be no extreme changes in the world economy in 2011, even though there is an expectation of increases in trade volumes for 2011 and 2012 by 7.1% and 6.8%, respectively. Since the beginning of 2010, the first signs of recovery from the global financial crisis have started to be seen, even though financial vulnerabilities still exist in some parts of the world. Especially debt problems and low growth rates and the US economy's ongoing recovery process from the financial crisis lead to deceleration in the enlargement process of the global economy.</p><p>In contrast to this, Turkey's economy has appreciated with its sustainable economic growth, deep-rooted banking system, low debt rates, and disciplined budget. In the latest OECD reports, the growth rate for the Turkish economy was anticipated at 8.2% in 2010, 5.3% in 2011, and 5.4% in 2012. Also, it is stated that unemployment will steadily decrease to 11% in 2012. Turkey has already achieved notable success in this field. In my opinion, Turkey will continue to increase its exports and growth rates in the future as in the year 2010. While increasing these rates, financial and economic stability will be provided as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[view-from-the-watchtower]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what practical ways is Turkey's Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) making progress in promoting domestic and international financial stability?</h4><p>We experienced a banking crisis in 2001 in which 20% of the banking sector failed in terms of assets as well as deposits. The cost of bank restructuring was financed by Treasury borrowings, in much the same way as countries around the world have been bailing out their own financial systems of late. These losses then have to be recovered by a resolution agency, and the SDIF became an independent agency with this goal in 2004. Prior to this, from 1999, it was under the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). Parliament then gave the SDIF some additional powers to speed up the resolution process and increase the recovery rate, especially from the claims and non-performing assets of majority shareholders. The SDIF is mainly working on follow-up actions on majority shareholders, and this is facilitated by the powers given to us by Parliament, entitling us to follow up on claims that the Treasury bore because of the 2001 crisis.</p><h4>Has the SDIF had to adopt a more ruthless attitude when resolving asset claims?</h4><p>We have conflicts with debtors; they want to pay less and we want to get as much as we can to maximize our recovery. The conflict is always there and we constantly face these kinds of problems. However, we don't require the bank owners to pay back all the losses of a failed bank and all the costs that were incurred because of the 2001 crisis. We have to be reasonable, and act from a reasonable legal base, and that means we recover what directly caused the losses; i.e. the credit they borrowed from a bank. The other issue is that the SDIF's mandate was not granted just after the crisis in 2001. In 2004 the SDIF became an independent authority, and just before that the government gave us additional powers to resolve non-performing assets. Due to the aging of assets, some of them lost their recoverability. They didn't have enough strength, so we were unable to receive as much income as we could have due to delays in taking action. Now we have the legal mandate and institutional capacity to take action immediately.</p><h4>Were the lessons learned in 2001 the reason why the Turkish financial sector was stable during the recent crisis?</h4><p>Absolutely, we are now seeing the fruits of our labor. We were affected minimally in comparison with the US and Europe. If we hadn't taken precautions in 2001, we would have been affected far more severely.</p><h4>The SDIF is dealing with the problems of the past in regards to its resolution activities. Is deposit insurance alone where the SDIF's future activities lie?</h4><p>After 2004, when we became independent from the BRSA, our mandate was focused on resolutions and insuring deposits. As you can see, our resolution activities are decreasing. As we sell off assets, we solve problems. Soon, we hope to finalize resolutions for two major ex-banks: Sümerbank and Etibank. After resolving the assets of these failed banks, our activities will be further reduced. However, after the 2001 crisis, we still continued our deposit insurance activities and we have improved greatly in this area. In 2009, for instance, we received the Deposit Insurer of the Year Award from the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI).</p><h4>What is the current situation regarding the Birleşik Fon Bankası (BFB)?</h4><p>This is the institution formerly called Bayındır Bank, under which we merged some of the failed banks in order to resolve those assets. Currently, this bank is handling leftover assets as well as the other liabilities that we have. Practically, BFB serves our resolution activities. For example, we cannot have the letters of credit of a failed bank on our SDIF books and we transferred those letters to BFB to deliver our obligations. We currently appoint the management, and they operate accordingly. At the end of the resolution activities of the BFB, its status will be assessed.</p><h4>The Adabank tender had only one bidder, Bank Pozitif, owned by Israel's Bank Hapoalim. What is your assessment of the tender process?</h4><p>There were three banks seriously interested, including Standard Chartered and Bahrain's BMI. Unfortunately, only Bank Hapoalim decided to bid and we were disappointed by this single bid. Deposit licenses are difficult to come by and are not being distributed by the BRSA. Adabank, as the owner of a license to operate a deposit bank, represents a good opportunity for a foreign bank to enter the market. For this reason, we are disappointed to have not seen more interest. For now, Adabank is the last bank to be sold; however, in the future BFB will also be looked at with a possible view to sell.</p><h4>Coming back to deposit insurance, is the level of up to TL50,000 that you currently offer still warranted to ensure confidence in the banking system?</h4><p>After the 2008 crisis most countries around the world increased their coverage; the US to $250,000 and the EU from a minimum of ‚¬20,000 to ‚¬50,000. At the end of 2010 every country had to make it a stable ‚¬100,000 all over Europe. However, the TL50,000 level of coverage is above the ‚¬20,000 that was the minimum requirement for EU regulators before the recent crisis. During the 2008 crisis we didn't increase the level of coverage, and we haven't seen any lack of confidence in the market as a result. The confidence of the public in the banking system is unwavering due to prudential regulation and the tight supervision of this sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) is pursuing an experimental policy in lowering interest rates while increasing reserve requirements. In your opinion, what will be the net impact of this policy?<br></h4><p>It is an interesting—albeit unconventional—policy. There are mixed outlooks for the policy, but it seems like it is working. One of the hesitations that the government had was that Turkey's economic success so far has drawn a lot of investments into Turkey, and especially “hot money", i.e. short-term-oriented capital coming in and out of the country. This policy change is aimed at averting this challenge. On the one hand, lowering interest rates is still going to stimulate the economy, and raising reserve requirements will affect the entrance and exit of hot money, and will help promote longer-term investments in Turkey. Coming up with an entry or exit tax on capital movements is not popular and wouldn't work in Turkey. With these policies the parameters can be changed very quickly, and depending on progress and international developments the CBT can lower or increase the reserve requirements. Changing interest rates so often is not desirable, but reserve requirements are easier to handle and help deposits to be longer term, and promotes longer-term investments. Regarding the stock exchange, foreign investors own two-thirds of the free float, and their average holding period is over a year. Combined with the fact that two-thirds of the free float belongs to institutional investors, accounting for 15% of the daily volume, we can easily see that the hot money issue is not affecting the equity markets. The problem is mainly in short-term instruments such as the fixed income and money markets. Net outflows from our equity market have only been $750 million, and our daily volume is over $2.2 billion. In 2010 net inflows were over $5 billion. In the month of January 2011 alone, net outflows were a little over $700 million.<br></p><h4>How will the policy stand up following a likely improvement in Turkey's investment grade?</h4><p>The rating improvement to investment grade will herald an increased amount of capital coming into the country, and the policies undertaken are in preparation for that. Everybody else in the world is considering similar measures, and some countries, such as Brazil, have applied an exit tax, which hasn't been so effective. Brazil is attracting a lot of foreign capital, and Turkey is now beginning to attract foreign capital in a similar way. Turkey has managed the effects of the crisis very well. The effect was sharp in 2008, but the recovery was quick. We saw the index drop quickly in 2008 as people lost confidence in the banks in the rest of the world and treated Turkish banks in the same manner. At the end of the 2008, investors saw the banking sector in Turkey declaring record high profits, and this continued in 2009 and 2010.</p><h4>How do you expect the banks to react to a lower interest rate climate?</h4><p>The expectation now is that, seeing as interest rates are low, the banking sector may not make as much money as in 2009 and 2010. Banking stocks are slightly lower, yet new capital is coming in, and this creates an opportunity. The banking sector has traditionally been making good money coming from government securities, which are now not as profitable. The government's need for borrowing has gone down, with total public sector debt previously being around 85% of GDP; now it is down to about 42%. So there is room for growth. Banks have started issuing bonds to raise cheaper capital. Credit to the real sector has also been increasing, and it will increase even more in 2011, yet under the gaze of the banking regulator, which does not want to see a huge increase in credit extended to the real sector. There is huge growth in mortgage and real sector credits, and the banks haven't utilized these areas well enough in the past. The growth story of the Turkish banking sector is not over. Mortgage credits outstanding are less than 10% of all credits in the banking sector, but in other developed countries and developing countries that is 30-40%, and even 50%. There is a huge growth potential for the banks. The banks will continue keeping the economy growing, and the interest in banking stocks will continue. In terms of the real sector, we have seen good growth in 2010 and in 2011 with lower interest rates and costs of borrowing, and new investments will continue. We just saw the production index was way above expectations—capacity utilizations have increased. This is also fueling growth. We will see the economy grow in 2011, and measures have been taken to smoothen that rate.</p><h4>2010 was a bumper year for the ISE in terms of IPOs. What expectations do you have in 2011?</h4><p>In the first 35 days of 2011 we had five public offerings. We have 10 more applications that we are reviewing as of February 2011. After a meeting that heralded the start of a national campaign on public offerings, 18 new companies joined between May 2010 and January 2011 compared to only four between January and May 2010. Obviously, increased awareness is helping. We have also taken steps to simplify the process of coming to market, and we are approaching companies all around the country and making it known that an offering does not mean a loss of control or incessant auditing.</p><h4>Many new instruments and platforms were seen in 2010. How is this shaping the evolution of the stock exchange?</h4><p>We introduced a warrants market, new fixed-income markets, a second repo market, and we have also launched a new market for SMEs. The warrants market is developing slowly as the investor base here is still very amateur. The SME segment is also unique in that it offers different IPO methods, trades differently, is more lenient on the disclosure periods of financial statements and independent audit requirements, and has also a tailored listing fee scheme. We have over a million investor accounts in the central depository, and these are all individual investors. Individual investors are the major force behind the liquidity in the market. When you look at the large amount of investors, the active ones are even fewer. Short-term investors generate the liquidity, but this liquidity has to be sustainable, and this means we have to increase the institutional investor base. The institutional investor base is really the type of investor that looks for more sophisticated investments. Warrants are a more sophisticated instrument, and individual investors do not know enough about them. It is a learning process, and it will take a while to develop the market, and we are pushing, through campaigns, to increase the supply of instruments coming to market, and the awareness necessary for them to be successful.</p><h4>What industries do you believe have the most growth potential in Turkey?</h4><p>I believe construction, electronics, automobile manufacturing, tourism, banking, and, in the next 5 to 10 years, software and services will develop quickly. The country will also remain strong in textiles, yet value-added products have to be introduced to the market as Turkey cannot compete against China.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2010 was a transitional year for Turkey's capital markets. What are your expectations for 2011?</h4><p>The year 2011 will be an interesting one for Turkey, and yet another key year for the Turkish debt capital markets. In 2010, Bank of America Merrill Lynch led the first private sector Eurobond issuance out of Turkey with Akbank's inaugural $1 billion five-year transaction. This was a milestone transaction as it demonstrated the ability of Turkish banks to successfully diversify their source of hard currency funding and their capability to extend their historically short-term debt maturity profile. As Turkey grows, and as the loan books of banks grow and increase in duration, Turkish banks become increasingly keen to term-out their funding base and diversify sources away from the syndicated loan market and short-term deposits.</p><p>Many of the legislative uncertainties around the issuance of Eurobonds were also clarified following this landmark transaction. For example, the rules around the withholding tax impact of issuing a Eurobond directly as opposed to utilizing a loan participation note structure were not yet clear when Akbank launched its inaugural Eurobond in July of 2010. There was also a less than clear view on whether Turkish investors could buy and trade the notes in the secondary market.</p><p>By the end of 2010, the government and the tax authorities put in place a framework that specifically addressed the uncertainties, whereby it was announced that direct Eurobond issuances by Turkish firms would attract 0% withholding tax provided that the term is five years or longer and that Turkish investors can buy and sell the notes in the secondary market without becoming liable to pay any withholding tax.</p><p>This was a significant development as it means that the cost of borrowing in the international debt capital markets became more palatable for Turkish firms and, as importantly, that the ability of Turkish investors to freely trade the notes will ensure that a healthy level of secondary market liquidity can be established.</p><p>Therefore, we start 2011 with a much clearer terrain for prospective issuers than 2010, and expect that it will be a busy year, where financial institutions group (FIG) borrowers in particular will be active in tapping the international debt capital markets with their inaugural or secondary Eurobond issuances. These borrowers will also be contemplating issuing in Turkish lira, which will likely be a follow-up to their inaugural issuance—expected to be denominated in US dollars.</p><p>Overall, I see 2011 as a year to lay the foundations for the future growth of the Turkish debt capital markets. In that respect, one shorter-term milestone that I forecast for the end of 2011/start of 2012 is for Turkish banks to start establishing their Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) funding programs, which will allow the prospective issuers to utilize different buckets and pools of demand in different currencies across an international investor base, whilst reducing the length of the execution phase as well as signaling investors of their intentions to become relatively frequent borrowers in the debt capital markets.</p><h4>How do you assess investor demand for Turkish debt?</h4><p>International debt investors are extremely bullish on Turkey and Turkish firms. Although the sovereign and private sector firms are still sub-investment grade, the levels at which these issuers can borrow underlines that investors perceive most of these credits to be the at the same level as investment grade issuers, where notably the Turkish sovereign has proven its ability to borrow in the international debt capital markets at levels associated with those of significantly higher rated countries.</p><p>Having said this, the debt capital markets of Turkey are still in the early part of their development phase, with the Turkish sovereign having been the only significant issuer until 2010 and Akbank, Yapı Kredi, İş Bank, Garanti Bank, and Finansbank having been the only major private sector firms to have issued until now.</p><p>Within Turkey a number of major Turkish private sector firms are seen as very close proxies to sovereign risk. However, as these firms are executing or are on the verge of launching their inaugural Eurobonds, they do not yet have a significant track record in the international debt capital markets. This in turn translates into a relatively higher level of spread over the Turkish Treasury than levels local Turkish investors would demand.</p><p>This disparity is natural at this stage in the development of a country's debt capital markets, and I foresee Turkey following the likes of Brazil in the short to medium term. In this regard, 2011 will be a key year for these issuers—likely to mainly be banks—when they will have the opportunity to lay the foundations of their international debt funding strategy via issuing their inaugural or secondary Eurobonds, which will act as an anchor for future issuances.</p><h4>Do you expect Turkey to hit investment grade in the near future, and what would be the impact of this rating change?</h4><p>I believe Turkey will reach investment grade. Our house view is that Fitch is likely to upgrade Turkey to investment grade in the second half of 2011. We believe Moody's and S&amp;P will put through one-notch upgrades in 2011, which will still leave Turkey below investment grade. However, we believe all three ratings agencies are likely to have Turkey at investment grade in 2012.</p><p>As mentioned before, Turkey is pricing at much tighter levels than its rating implies. But being sub-investment grade has its limitations. A number of investors are unable or restricted in their ability to invest in sub-investment grade debt, which currently is a limitation for Turkish issuers. Once this barrier is removed, the amount of investor demand toward Turkish paper will increase significantly. This will positively affect pricing through tightening credit spreads and will incentivize a wider base of Turkish corporates to tap the international capital markets.</p><h4>How would you gauge general investor interest in Turkey from the UK perspective?</h4><p>It is extremely positive. Turkey is one of the top emerging market countries in terms of possessing a highly pro-business mindset, with well established laws and regulations, relatively transparent legal framework, and a well capitalized and strongly regulated banking system. Investor perception toward the country has been continuously improving since 2001, when Turkey had its very own banking crisis, with the country having witnessed increasing political and economic stability. As a result, many investors are bullish on Turkey and would like to see more Turkish debt being issued both from the sovereign and FIG/corporate borrowers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are running the first independent non-bank hedge fund in Turkey. What does this mean for the country?<br></h4><p>We need to put this in the context of the maturity of the industry overall. For the recent development and increased sophistication of finance in Turkey, the fund management sub-sector is remarkably undeveloped considering the other aspects of the Turkish economy. Turkey has a very strong and competitive banking sector, and the brokerage sector is also strong. The fund management sector has, however, remained embryonic for a number of reasons. There has been a lack of transparency and competition, and this has been the main reason. Other reasons, until fairly recently, include the typical volatility and high interest rates associated with any uncertain emerging market environments. Our fund represents something of a breakthrough in the market in the sense that it is arguably one of the only funds that competes on the basis of returns to investors. When you look at the current state of the fund management sector now, you find that the industry has, to put it mildly, had a hard time creating any value for clients. The structure of the industry at the moment is more a result of the distribution strength of the incumbents rather than their fund management skills. As an independent player in this market, we represent a new approach in the sense that our interests are entirely aligned with those of the clients. Providing value-added to clients is somewhat a matter of life and death  for us.</p><h4>How has the fund been performing of late?</h4><p>We have sharply outperformed the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) 100 since inception in late 2010; however, past returns are of course no indication of future performance. Unlike other funds in the market, this is the first on-shore regulated hedge fund in the sense that we do not do anything terribly exotic, and we aim for absolute returns irrespective of market conditions. If you claim to have some fund management skills, this is the vehicle via which you will be able to display those skills. The flip side of the coin is that the vehicle provides no excuses for sub-par returns. Even if the market is down 30% we still expect to make money. Like I said, that helps keep us on our toes to really make money for our clients.</p><h4>One method you employ to ensure returns regardless of market conditions is short selling. This phrase has garnered a negative connotation since the crisis. What can you say in response to that?</h4><p>It is a testament to how ill-informed public opinion can be that short selling has acquired such a negative connotation. In an ideal world I would have hoped for inflating bubbles to have acquired more of a negative reputation, as I believe that is the bigger crime, and where the true ills lie. Years and years of irresponsible behavior from regulators to market participants led to a massive bubble, and it seems unfair that short selling has been branded in the way that it has.</p><h4>Do you feel the regulatory response to the crisis worldwide has been appropriate?</h4><p>The response has been criminal. We are seeing the mother of all wealth transfers from savers and taxpayers to speculators and risk takers. I believe risk takers should be reacquainted with the risk side of the risk-reward equation. For example, the “bailouts" of countries such as Greece have been sold to the taxpayers as a bailout of the country, when in fact it is nothing of the sort and merely a bailout of creditors to those countries.</p><p>Greece still owes 100 cents on the dollar, so it has not been bailed out; what has happened is that the debt has been transferred from the private sector to the public sector. All the hedge funds and irresponsible banks that should have taken a haircut were effectively given lifeboats to get off of the sinking ship. The majority of Greek debt is now held by the ECB and the IMF, which are of course taxpayer funded. Now that the transfer has been completed there is talk of debt restructuring. This should have occurred back in May 2010, and people who lent to Greece and collected interest and CDS premiums should also have taken a haircut. The policy response will go down in history as a blatant case of regulatory capture. As this becomes apparent the inevitable taxpayer revolt will foster extremist political rhetoric in the opposite direction. So not only was the current bunch of regulators asleep at the wheel when the car crashed, but their response was also lacking.</p><p>Whenever they were faced with a choice between Wall Street and main street, Wall Street won out. Like I said, this will have far reaching political effects, such as the Tea Party in the US. It ultimately runs the risk of creating an environment where the notion of free markets in the market will be jeopardized, as the average taxpayer who had nothing to do with speculation has received the short end of the stick. Their savings have been impaired, and what little they have left is earning zero so that the banks can climb their way out of the holes they dug for themselves.</p><h4>What can you tell us about your investment strategy, and what are the strengths of Turkey's capital markets?</h4><p>Turkey has been fortunate in the sense that it experienced a crisis seven or eight years before the global crisis. Turkey hit the wall pretty hard, and the policy response was robust and correct. The environment that succeeded the crisis allowed for far reaching structural reform here. This would not have been possible under ordinary circumstances. In place of the crony capitalist structure we saw the establishment of a strong institutional framework. In key areas of the economy and the decision-making process, authority was transferred to certain independent regulatory bodies such as the Banking Regulatory and Supervisory Agency (BRSA).</p><p>Under normal circumstances it would not have been possible to enact these reforms, and was only possible under the gravest of circumstances. When the global crisis hit, Turkey had managed to pull itself back from the brink. Debt to GDP was around 90% in 2002, and it is now around 40%. The public sector deficit to GDP was in the high teens, and it is now hovering around 3%. Turkey is ironically one of the very few non-EU countries that can satisfy the Maastricht criteria. In a world that is grappling with recession and very high public debt levels, Turkey, in stark contrast, has its public finance house very much in order. Again, the resulting improvements in the regulatory environment have led to a huge increase in competitiveness, and this has led to growth. We sometimes have to pause to remember that these political decisions need voter approval, and high growth lubricates the wheels in that sense. This has greatly improved the quality of public debate and policy innovation. For the first time in several hundred years, we are seeing fairly transparent governance in this country. In comparison to the fiascos of the 1990s, it is refreshing to see the level of public debate and policy formulation here. Going forward I think it is leading to a more prominent position for Turkey in global politics, and the country has done well to expand its sphere of influence. Again, these overtures very much fed into supporting the economy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish economy and for your hedge fund?</h4><p>For the first time in quite a while Turkey's fate is in its own hands. It is not captive to circumstances beyond its control. Success or failure will lie with the choices that Turkey itself makes. Unless Turkey shoots itself in the foot I'd say its prospects are very good. Life will not be a walk in the park as far as the financial markets are concerned because the course of a country and price movements are not necessarily correlated with anything meaningful.</p><p>For the hedge fund we can say that everything is so far so good. Like I said, we strongly feel that this is the correct vehicle for investing in Turkey. That said, it is a new proposition for the majority of local investors. As you may know, because of the volatility of the stock market and some other reasons such as very high interest rates, the number of equity investors in Turkey has been stagnant for about 15 years. The investing public has overwhelmingly gravitated towards fixed income investments, and fixed income investments only.</p><p>It is only this phenomenon of new rates that is compelling investors to look for alternatives, and a hedge fund is a relatively new option. To this extent market education is required. When awareness rises the potential will be huge. To give you an idea, the total mutual funds under management account for approximately 3.2% of GDP, which is an extremely low number. In other developing countries the number is typically between 35% and 100% of GDP depending on the level of development. What is more is that of that 3.2%, 2.7% is actually money market funds, which are nothing more than a poor substitute for bank deposits. As a true investment product, we are talking about something less than half-a-percent of GDP. That can double every year for the next 10 years and still be nowhere near global standards. So, the potential is huge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the global state of the factoring industry, and how has it responded to the global economic crisis?</h4><p>The global factoring industry, in stark contrast to the banking industry, has managed to pass through the crisis years very successfully. I believe that the basic elements of factoring—invoices and trade receivables—have been strong, and will remain so. The crisis presented an opportunity for factoring companies as businesses that were unable to obtain credit financing from banks found solutions amongst our products. Businesses can raise funds through factoring more easily by using their short-term receivables when it has been more difficult to access credit finance through banks. Factoring is a traditional way of financing for businesses, and more and more companies are going back to basics. The crisis offered an opportunity for a reshuffling of the finance industry, and factoring has benefitted greatly.</p><h4>How would you assess the factoring industry in Turkey?</h4><p>The factoring industry is relatively young in Turkey, having only been established around 20 years ago. We have seen a significant acceleration in growth in the last 10 years or so. In the last five years, the sector began to be regulated by the banking watchdog [the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency], which has taken the industry to the next level. There are now strict requirements for reporting and auditing as well as client selection and control. This is positively affecting the quality of factoring companies and helping to improve the image of the industry, and therefore attract more clients to our services. Factoring industry turnover reached almost $50 billion in 2010. This figure is attributable to the aggregate volume of the 60+ members of the National Factoring Association of Turkey, which account for nearly 95% of the total factoring market here. The biggest growth continues to be driven from the domestic factoring business with a transaction volume of $44 billion, representing roughly 90% of industry volume. This is mainly due to a pick-up in economic activity and high growth rate in the country's GDP.</p><h4>How much importance does the government attach to factoring as a driver of the country's economy?</h4><p>Factoring is an important area of finance, and we are becoming a driver of trade and industry. The development of SMEs has been highlighted by the government as vital to the future growth of the economy. Our services are tailored to SMEs, and as we lend them support we are boosting the economy and helping to drive down the unemployment rate.</p><h4></h4><h4>What role does factoring play in trade?</h4><p>We provide working capital solutions for companies. Every company has unique needs. When a business needs to extend its payment terms, or runs into difficulty with its main buyers, our products can offer the solution. Our trade finance solutions work in the name of the supply chain, whether it be domestic or international. It is common that large buyers have dominance over payment terms. Small companies may have less bargaining power and be unable to negotiate more favorable terms leading to a probable financial squeeze. We can support them with financing solutions based on their receivables. We assist importers by helping them make earlier payments. We also offer guarantees to foreign buyers of Turkish products to eliminate the chance of back outs based on trust issues.</p><p>We can also help Turkish exporters who meet new buyers at international trade fairs from whom they receive orders for their products and they doubt their creditworthiness or ability to meet their payment obligations. We provide credit protection for exporters and their receivables by obtaining guarantee services from our international counterparties, who cover the buyer's risk in their local market and arrange financing internally if needed. Our large range of services has supported trade admirably, and we are proud to support the country's SMEs.</p><h4>Garanti Factoring is a pioneer of the factoring industry in Turkey. What differentiates Garanti from its competitors?</h4><p>Garanti Factoring is the oldest factoring company from the first years of the industry in Turkey. Garanti already has a strong brand and is fully committed to the industry, with services available across the country, using Garanti Bank's vast local distribution channels through an extensive branch network. However, the industry is still in its initial stages of development, and so the number of clients we have as an industry can be doubled every year for the next 5 to 10 years and still not be at a level seen in countries where factoring is more developed.</p><h4>What can we expect from your 2010 financials?</h4><p>In 2010, there has been significant growth in Garanti Factoring's customer base and increase in market penetration that have been positively reflected in the company's performance. Total factoring turnover for 2010 reached $10 billion.</p><p>Turnover is seeing strong growth as larger corporates are entering the industry as clients. Our client numbers and the amount of financing we provide are going to grow at a rate of at least 25% this year. This is a figure seen as a target in the banking industry, and a figure the government sees as tolerable, so as not to cause inflation.</p><h4>A lot has changed since the early days of Garanti Factoring. What is next for the company?</h4><p>Garanti Factoring maintains its ongoing support to the real sector through its wide product suite and financial solutions to its customers, offering cash flow management through trade finance, secure sales through the credit protection of receivables, supply-chain finance both for domestic and international business, export and import products, as well as commercial collection management. With our unique innovative approach in the sector, Garanti Factoring aims to continue pioneering the offering of new initiatives in customer-driven products and solutions and making a change in the sector. The SME market is our top priority, and Garanti Factoring has successfully achieved its regional expansion of a strong sales force nationwide. Through close cooperation and synergies with the parent bank, Garanti Factoring capitalizes on Garanti Bank's commercial banking expertise and client history. Garanti Factoring is the leading import factoring company in Turkey. We work hand-in-hand with Garanti Bank to provide our services wherever they are needed. Garanti Bank can also provide us with referrals when they identify suitable clients from its portfolio. This helps us create new leads in the market.</p><h4>Which areas of Turkey do you see business developing in?</h4><p>After the removal of the visa requirement between Turkey and Syria, Turkish cities close to the border displayed an immediate desire to trade. I see great growth potential in that area, as well as in cities along the Iraqi border. The Ankara region is also developing industrially, and Konya and Bursa are improving their already strong manufacturing industries. As well as its prominence in the tourism industry, Antalya is also showing signs of industrial growth potential. Behind these leaders, cities like Åžanlıurfa and Adana are also starting to show potential.</p><h4>What other developments in the finance sector will bring benefits to the factoring industry?</h4><p>Basel III will create a situation in which the banks will rate companies. This is not a requirement for factoring companies and this offers us a window of opportunity. Factoring provides low-risk financing. I think more and more companies will adopt a “back to basics" approach. We are also trying to create harmonization on the EU level. The EU Federation for the Factoring and Commercial Finance Industry, an association of national factoring associations, has been established to conduct lobbying activities in Brussels. Lawmakers will increasingly hear the needs of the industry. Banking is far ahead in terms of regulation, factoring just needs a little more time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Turkish factoring sector began in the 1990s, playing a large role in helping save the financial sector at that time. What role would you say factoring plays in Turkey today?<br></h4><p>I believe the Turkish economy has a big capital deficit. Every big actor needs more working capital, and every company needs supplier credit, so there will be more potential for factoring, because factoring companies buy supplier receivables. Every entrepreneur needs supplier credit because our financial system is small and doesn't have sufficient credit to give to entrepreneurs. As a result, entrepreneurs need supplier credit more than financial credit. An economy that is more in need of supplier credit also has a greater potential for factoring.</p><h4>In what sectors of the economy are you most active in terms of providing supplier credit?</h4><p>In our company in particular we are focused mostly on the construction and real estate sectors. This is natural considering these two sectors are booming in Turkey. We have the second biggest construction sector in the world, and the growing population and economy in Turkey means there's always a need for new housing. Many young people used to live with their parents a decade ago, but these days young people move out and live on their own. Companies in these infrastructural fields always need as much credit as possible, and often don't have enough money to pay immediately, or need a lengthy period to pay suppliers. That's where we come in. We sign a notarized agreement whereby the suppliers give all their financial rights to the factoring company, which essentially buys their invoices, and a certain amount of it is paid to the suppliers as credit, so that the payments due to them from clients are paid to the factoring company instead.</p><h4>Following double-digit growth since your company began, what is your forecast for continued growth?</h4><p>We foresee 40% growth for 2011, although I believe we will surpass that because ours is a well-known, listed company. We have different financial resources than other factoring companies due to the fact that we're respected, reliable, and trustworthy. For example, we issue secondary private bonds.</p><h4>Will this growth come from overall growth in the sector or from an increase in your market share?</h4><p>Both. The sector is expected to grow about 30% in 2011. Certainly, the factoring sector's growth will be reflected in our figures, especially considering our standing in the sector. We stand to gain a lot from that growth.</p><h4>How has Creditwest become so well known?</h4><p>I think what sets us apart from the competition is our image, our human resources, our financial resources, and the tailor-made solutions we offer to our clients. Our human resources are perhaps the most important of those. We have a well-educated and experienced team. Many of them have worked together for more than 15 years. We work well together, we know each other, and our clients know us. We hire only the most qualified people. In addition to our factoring services, we also provide financial advice and consulting to our clients in this company. We know the credit markets, and we know finance. We will advise against the use of factoring in favor of, say, leasing or investment credits from a bank if we think factoring might not be the best option for our client. As for our image, that too is one of our strengths. We are a listed company and our main shareholder, Altınbaş, is well known and well respected in Turkey, and operates in jewelry, energy, and finance. Our track record speaks for itself—in our seven years of operations in Turkey we haven't encountered a single hiccup. All of these factors build trust, familiarity, and assurance in the Creditwest name.</p><h4>You've built one of the fastest growing companies in Turkey, and certainly one of the fastest growing companies in the factoring sector. What are your plans for Creditwest's long-term future?</h4><p>We plan on a much bigger balance sheet in the future. That means a balance sheet of more than TL1 billion. I think that should be our minimum size. Turkey will be a sizeable economy, and a company in that economy will have to be big to survive. Our shareholder is a strong company, we have a great relationship with our clients, and we have a great image in the business community overall. If we can't achieve our goals with those kinds of strengths in our favor, then it will only be our own fault.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[new-ways-to-pay]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey has become one of Europe's largest credit card markets. What are the reasons for this growth?<br></h4><p>Turkey has been one of Europe's biggest credit card markets for a long time. There are some underlying factors behind this. We have seen, especially after 2000, a significant increase in card usage. The first reason for this is the traditionally high inflation rate, meaning Turkish people have preferred to use their credit cards instead of cash or debit cards, allowing them to take advantage of the time-value of money. The quick evolution of the credit card business after 2000 is also partly attributable to the rapid issuance of multi-merchant loyalty programs. Looking back, the first credit card in Turkey was launched in the late 1980s. Back then, credit cards were mainly used only by high-net-worth customers. Only after 2000 did we see credit cards become more widely used. The main driver of this was loyalty programs. If you compare Turkey to the rest of the world, it is easy to see that the level of loyalty programs here is far higher than the levels seen in Europe or the US. Such programs offer instant cash back, interest-free installments, free entry to airport lounges, various discounts, and lots of other gifts and benefits. It therefore doesn't make sense to use cash instead of a card. If we look at the market today, there are around 45 million credit cards and 65 million debit cards. In terms of usage, the two categories have more or less the same total volume, around ‚¬100 billion. However, a significant difference can be seen in terms of how they are utilized. For credit cards, 90% of the volume is on purchases. For debit cards it is very different, with 95% of the volume being ATM cash withdrawals. This is one of the main areas where Turkey is distinguished from the rest of the world.<br></p><h4>On a shorter-term basis, how would you assess the market in 2010, and what are your expectations for 2011?</h4><p>In terms of our business, Turkey has been a very successful double-digit growth country. What we have seen in 2010 is not very different from previous years in that respect. The market grew by 15% in terms of credit card volumes. This is still an attractive growth rate. It used to be higher, with figures as high as 25%, or 35% having been seen before. As most available segments get covered, a decline in the growth rate is expected. In 2011, I believe we will have more or less the same rate of growth.</p><h4>To what extent has innovation been a driver in the market?</h4><p>Innovation has been a superb driver for the market. Turkey has been a benchmark country for other European countries. Its loyalty programs have been praised and admired by many countries around the world, and although similar programs have not met with as much success elsewhere, comparable programs have been launched in various regions. Putting this type of innovation aside, technological innovation is also playing a huge role. Contactless cards have been launched in Turkey, and this was a first for Europe. Other “form factor" contactless methods, such as wristwatches, or stickers, have also been launched in Turkey. These are examples of how innovative Turkey has been in terms of payment tools. Following the 2006 launch of contactless payment cards, the system has been integrated into the transportation systems in major Turkish cities. We are also now progressing to the next phase, which is mobile payments, and this will be a totally unique payment platform. With a plastic card you are dependent on the point of sale terminal. The benefits of paying with a mobile handset are then obvious, and the possibilities from a marketing perspective are also superb. To further these aims, we have launched two programs with two major issuers in Turkey. One of them was with Garanti Bank and Avea, and it is a program that utilizes a specific tool that circumvents the need to have a Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled handset, which are currently rare on the market. The second program was with Bank Asya, with which we launched a similar application. It enables payments to be made with a mobile wallet application. These are the first steps in the mobile payment arena. In 2011 we have had similar requests to develop tools from other major issuers. This is the most exciting component of innovation for the moment. From 2012 onwards we will see an expansion of mobile payment tools across the country with many different applications.</p><h4>In this race to the mobile payment arena, how does Turkey rank compared to other countries?</h4><p>MasterCard initiated mobile payments in 2002, when PayPass was first introduced to the market. At that time it was just a pilot. To be able to make mobile payments, there need to be contactless readers in the country. So, in this respect, we launched PayPass in 2006 in Turkey, and we have around 3 million contactless cards in the country, and close to 45,000 readers. We have the infrastructure in place to move to the next step. Comparing Turkey to the rest of Europe, there are some pilot projects in different countries, but Turkey is leading the continent in the number of projects underway, and Turkey was the first country to launch these programs commercially.</p><h4>Turkey is also leading many countries in terms of its retail banking innovations and the use of technology in the commercial arena. What do you believe are the reasons behind this?</h4><p>Turkey is indeed leading many countries in terms of innovation. I believe that there are a couple of reasons for this. One is that Turkey has a huge, young population. The average age is around 27-28 years, and 60% of the population is below the age of 30. The younger generations are obviously more open to new technologies, and new types of gadgets. Adoption rates for new products in Turkey are very high. The second factor is the level of competition in the market. From a financial institution point of view, all the players have very advanced tools, with well-marketed products aimed at creating differentiation. These institutions need something to invest in, and this is technology and innovation. This kind of technological publicity strengthens brands, and attracts customers.</p><h4>Istanbul is the regional headquarters for MasterCard. Why was it chosen to play this role?</h4><p>We manage operations in 10 countries from our offices in Istanbul, including Turkey, Israel, CIS countries, and Malta. In terms of card payments, Turkey is a country that has been in the top three in Europe for a while. This means there are lots of interesting and useful developments here that can be exported to other markets. In my first role at MasterCard I was a project manager, and my role was to share know-how in Turkey with other countries in Europe. We used this know-how to launch new card programs, tools, and solutions with other issuers in Europe. Basically, this is a market that is a center of excellence in terms of card payments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tell us about bartering, since this is a relatively unknown form of modern trade. How does it work?</h4><p>Bartering is basically an alternative financing system. It was, of course, the first form of trade before the invention of money. Today it stands as an alternative to the use of money. Bartering has advanced to the point where it can be done by card and check. You open an account at a barter bank in much the same way as at a normal bank. The account-holder states what products or services they want to exchange; basically, what they offer, and what products they are willing to trade their products for. Our banking system helps our customers get into contact with each other so they can exchange what they need.</p><h4>What sort of services do you offer?</h4><p>We've developed a whole range of services, including barter leasing, barter tourism, barter health, barter construction, and barter media. We've even converted some into companies in their own right. For example, we have a completely independent finance company that specializes in barter insurance. Our goal is to meet the needs of those who have problems finding credit on the finance market. You can even reclaim or pay off your debt by bartering your products. It's an alternative system of financing, payment, and trade. We help companies with marketing, we help them reduce their stock, we help them raise their production capacity, and we help them protect cash savings.</p><h4>How widespread is barter in Turkey?</h4><p>Actually, a lot of companies in Turkey and around the world already engage in some form of unofficial bartering; advertising companies produce ads for goods, construction firms receive construction materials as payment for apartment units, but the only company that engages in official corporate bartering is Turk Barter. We introduced the bartering system to Turkey in 1994.</p><h4>What about the rest of the world? How common is barter in international trade?</h4><p>We recently participated in the 31st International Reciprocal Trade Association Convention in the US, where there were representatives of 42 barter exchanges from all over the world, including China, Singapore, South America, New Zealand, France, Portugal, and the UK. Turk Barter has been a member of the International Reciprocal Trade Association since 1994. I'm a member of the board of directors and I head the European committee. Our aim is to raise awareness of the value of the barter system in the  global community.</p><h4>Given the mistrust in financial markets of late, what makes bartering an attractive and viable trading alternative?</h4><p>When you receive credit from a bank you must repay it with hard currency and with interest. In the bartering system you don't have to pay interest, and it enables trade in goods and services for those who might otherwise lack financing. Furthermore, since you're exchanging products, it enables traders to increase sales, move inventory, conserve cash, and utilize excess production capacity.</p><h4>How do potential member companies react when you approach them with your system?</h4><p>When we prepare a barter project for a company, it's always designed specifically for that company, taking into consideration its products, its needs, and its interests. So it's very rare that they don't agree to our proposal. Furthermore, we're preparing special custom-made projects designed to enable all our member companies to participate in the barter system.</p><h4>How many members do you have?</h4><p>We have 5,600 members. Also, our membership is constantly growing, but we keep a close watch on growth to so as to maintain a balance between supply and demand.</p><h4>Do you have any new projects you're working on to spread the appeal of barter?</h4><p>We have several. Our newest and biggest project involves online bartering on the www.barterfirsati.com website. Anyone can become a member of that site, including individuals. It's still on its test run, but it will be launched soon. We expect it to have a huge effect in retail. To give an example, even those who bought time-share apartments that they no longer use can now trade them online thanks to this site. We also have a joint project with MasterCard that we expect will bring about a revolution in the way we do trade. It's the first such system in the world.</p><h4>How is the barter system regulated?</h4><p>We've made a proposal for the legal regulation of barter trading in Turkey so that the trade can have legal protection. We handed the proposal to the government and we're waiting for a response. At present, barter companies are considered commercial companies, but we think they should rather be considered as finance companies, and they should thus be tightly regulated and controlled. However, we believe that there should be specific legal parameters for bartering just as there is for other financial institutions. The implementation timescale of such regulations is then dependent on the government.</p><h4>Is the barter market constituted primarily of SMEs or are there also larger firms involved?</h4><p>There are many large firms and holdings. The only thing that is crucial for us, regardless of the size of our members, is that we maintain a balance between demand and supply. In the same way that you can use money everywhere, you can also use barter.</p><h4>How do you establish the values of bartered commodities?</h4><p>We use the prices that already exist in the market. Nothing changes in that respect. If something is worth $1,000 then it's still worth $1,000. We don't set our own prices, and this applies whether you're buying goods or services.</p><h4>How do you see the barter market developing in the coming years in terms of the unification of the different international barter goods?</h4><p>The majority of bartering companies are in the US, and there are also many in Europe. Unfortunately, because large firms haven't been participating and investing in barter trade, the majority of companies operating in Europe remain small. In addition, there is a large bartering company in England, and there is also now a Chinese bartering company supported by the Chinese state. In one year they obtained 300,000  members! So we are seeing barter companies that operate in large economies obtaining a lot of members. There are also barter companies in Canada, Brazil, Spain and elsewhere, and it's growing every year.</p><h4>What role do you think barter trade will have in the modern world? Do you think it can be a realistic alternative to modern banking?</h4><p>Yes, it is. Because when the banking system collapses, the world shakes to its core. It's a system based on the printing of money that is not linked to a standard commodity like gold or an actual manufactured good. You have the problem of inflation, of strong currencies dominating weaker currencies. But in the barter system every product or service has a real value that corresponds with other products and services. So barter is more of a “real" economy. Take the recent mortgage crisis for example: the world economy ended up going into a downward spiral precisely because the system was based on exaggerated housing prices. You don't have such bubbles in a barter system. When the barter system becomes regulated and integrated like the banking system, I believe it will be a very powerful alternative to traditional banking. There is always a debate about the dollar, or what will happen to the euro. Everyone is looking for an alternative method of trade and I believe that what we're looking for, what will answer these problems and questions, is the barter system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Investors are always seeking an answer to the same question: “Why should I invest in this country?" The answer in Turkey's case is that the country is rising in many ways. The Turkish economy is the 16th largest in the world, the sixth largest in Europe, and is rightfully labeled by many as the BRIC of Europe. We grew by 11% in the first half of 2010 and we are expecting total growth of more than 7% for the year, reaching a GNP threshold of $1 trillion in PPP terms. We aim to be among the top 10 economies in the world by the year 2023, when we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey.</p><p>The developed infrastructure can also help facilitate growth and encourage investment. Turkey is a hub for transportation, telecoms, and energy. Turkey has become the energy corridor and terminal of Europe. Currently it has the capacity to transport 121 million tons of oil to the world's markets every year. This is projected to increase to 221 million tons plus 43 billion cubic meters of natural gas, with new natural gas and oil projects on the way.</p><p>The Turkish economy has become strategically important in its region during the last decade. An increasing focus on the private sector, with an ambitious privatization program, which generated more than $40 billion, has transformed the economy. In a nutshell, Turkey has moved from an inward-focused import substitution economic model toward an industrial export-led growth driven by knowledge accumulation.</p><p>Turkey's central strategic location at the point where the East meets the West and the South meets the North, and its ability to reach and serve its surroundings—Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East—are key assets. The country has historic, cultural, and linguistic links with more than 1 billion people in its broader neighborhood, where Turkey's market penetration is strong particularly in automotive, durable, and consumer goods as well as in the construction sector.</p><p>From Istanbul, it only takes four hours by plane to reach more than 50 countries, which represent a quarter of the world's population and a quarter of the world's economy. As a result of this investor-friendly environment, Turkey attracted foreign capital worth more than $75 billion between 2003 and 2009. Ten years ago, the number of foreign companies was only around 5,000. This number has steadily increased and reached around 23,500 in 2009. We have registered an approximate 26% increase in the number of foreign companies during the last two years alone, despite the global economic downturn.</p><p>Turkey's foreign policy goal of effective diplomacy with its neighbors promotes unrivalled influence and regional cooperation. As economic interdependence is a foundation of a stable and prosperous environment, Turkey is encouraging regional development and integration schemes around it.</p><p>Going forward, in order to avoid the recurrence of financial instability, we must draw the proper lessons from this global crisis. We should remember that the crisis was caused by the irresponsible acts of some financial institutions in the most developed markets. Unfortunately, ordinary people have paid the highest price for the mistakes of a few.</p><p>The current economic crisis unveiled, once again, the weaknesses and deficiencies of the existing global and national financial and economic architecture, which lack efficient governance and regulation over those reckless financial institutions. I believe that the G-20 should continue to play a central role in putting together the right policies and measures to that effect. In that endeavor, we should act with the principles of free and fair trade, and avoid currency wars and protectionist tendencies. Let us not forget that we are in the same boat, irrespective of our development levels, in the face of these turbulent waters.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Turkey 2023:  Strong Democracy, Strong Economy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[turkey-2023-strong-democracy-strong-economy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I believe that our export figures are a very good way to gauge the robustness of the Turkish economy. Total Turkish exports in 1923, the year our republic was founded, amounted to $51 million. Unfortunately, for decades after that, there was no significant growth in overall foreign trade and export figures. It was only in 1969 that annual exports reached $500 million. They reached the $1 billion mark in 1973.<br></p><p>By 2002, exports were recorded at a value of $36 billion, the highest level of annual exports in 79 years. In 2004, we once again reached an important threshold, surpassing $50 billion; by 2008, we attained a record sum in the history of our republic—$132 billion. The global economic crisis and its adverse effect on international trade also took their toll on Turkey, but by 2009 exports were recorded at $102 billion, and by 2010, the figure had reached $114 billion.</p><p>When we look at the monthly figures from the Turkish Exporters Assembly, we see that in the first five months of 2011 alone, Turkish exports reached $54 billion. Export figures from the past 12 months show growth of 14%, reaching $123 billion. We hope to reach $132 billion by the end of 2011. We have set a very ambitious goal for ourselves, and it will be a long road to achieve that goal. Our goal is that by 2023, the centenary of the Turkish Republic, annual exports will reach $500 billion. The Turkish Exporters Assembly prepared a very detailed 2023 strategy and has subsequently announced it to the public.</p><p>We will continue to mobilize Turkey's potential by working, producing, and selling. The process that began with $51 million in 1923 will have increased ten thousand fold 100 years later, in 2023. We have attained these levels by solving problems, overcoming obstacles, and working in unison through consultation and cooperation. We will continue to work in the same way—united—so as to reach that $500 billion objective.</p><h4>JUNE 12: A FRESH START</h4><p>The general elections on June 12 mark a very important and fresh new beginning in terms of reaching our 2023 goals. With these elections, Turkey has opened a new page in its progress. When we look at exports since 1923, we find that they have always increased parallel to the development of democratization and an active foreign policy. All economic indicators, especially exports, have improved on a solid, consistent, and safe trajectory, parallel to our democratization reforms and strong foreign policy.</p><p>There is no doubt that the fast pace of economic growth and increase in exports since 2002 is a result of the stable and secure environment that Turkey has become, and the brave democratic reforms that have been achieved. Today, the fact that democratization and economic growth must develop in parallel—hand-in-hand—has been proven beyond all shadow of a doubt. That's why the new process that began with the June 12, 2011 general elections carries so much importance.</p><p>We will attain our 2023 objectives by developing Turkey's standards in all fields in the coming 12 years. Our goal is not just to bring annual exports up to $500 billion. That is only part of a broader aim to create a Turkey that is a strong and stable, modern player in its region, and a country where democratic standards have reached much higher levels parallel to ongoing economic development. As long as this environment of stability and security continues, as long as we continue to pursue an active and peaceful foreign policy, and as long as democratic reforms continue unabated, we have no doubt that our 2023 goals will be reached of their own accord. When we look at Turkey's history of democratization, we see that this will clearly be the case. The first multi-party general elections were held in 1946. Since 1946, there has been a vibrant and heated discourse on democracy in Turkey, and an ongoing debate over the idea of a truly open, free, and fair democracy based unconditionally on the will of the people. We have had to overcome crises, calamity, and often great pain, experiencing interruptions along the way. But this nation has never lost its hope and has always gone to the ballot box to defend and uphold the national will.</p><p>One of the most important messages of the June 12, 2011 elections is this: our nation has reached a point of democratic maturity whereby democracy is now a fundamental part of our national identity. When faced with any kind of crisis, any kind of debate, or any kind of issue, our nation goes to the ballot box and has the last word. The idea that sovereignty truly and completely rests with the people, that the nation is the sole determiner of its own fate, has now become firmly ingrained in our culture and identity.</p><p>Turkey has now achieved a very high level of democratic maturity, with a robust democratic culture and very high standards of democracy that have been embraced by the people. It is now unavoidable that every institution in Turkey, be it political parties, civil society, or the media, also attain these standards.</p><h4>THE OTHER 50%</h4><p>The June 12 elections do not just signify a fresh start for Turkey. There is also now a great new horizon, a whole new vision, and a different culture of democracy in our country. Yesterday's parameters belong to yesterday. Yesterday's debates have now been left behind us. Our nation has clearly and finally turned its back on yesterday's political polemics and on yesterday's style of politics.</p><p>To not heed the message of the ballot box belongs to yesterday's political culture. Today's political culture is about paying very close attention to the message of the ballot box and taking the necessary steps accordingly. I say this clearly: we are more concerned with the 50% who did not vote for us than we are for the 50% that did. Just as we did after the September 12, 2010 referendum, we are also trying to understand the 50% of the public who did not vote for us on June 12.</p><p>Our research, evaluation, and scientific studies concerning this factor continue. We are trying to understand who we were unable to appeal to, and who we were unable to explain ourselves to. We hope and expect that the other political parties do the same.</p><p>The nation has handed us the responsibility of governing the country for the third time, and with a far greater number of votes than in the previous two elections. We continue to work for the nation, keeping this responsibility fully in mind. We have no desire to revive the polemics and debates of the past.</p><h4>A NEW CONSTITUTION</h4><p>The new process that was begun by the June 12 elections is one in which I believe the rule of law will become much more firmly entrenched in our country. This will be a process in which democratic standards will reach new heights. Recent debates and events also show that Turkey is now, more than ever, in need of serious legal reform and a new constitution.</p><p>We will never accept or condone any obstacle to, any privilege above, or any shadow cast over the will of the people. Turkey is a state of law. We are all critical of the constitution. However these criticisms do not mean that we will not respect or act within the parameters of these laws. We will discuss, debate, consult, share, and consider all these criticisms together.</p><p>Going into the June 12 elections, our greatest project was that of formulating a new constitution. We have clearly and openly stated that our aim is to create a broad consensus for the new constitution. Despite the problems encountered in the opening of the new parliament, I strongly believe that we will create a new constitution that will be embraced by all 74 million of my fellow citizens. Turkish democracy has the maturity and experience to be able to achieve this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[An SME Story]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[an-sme-story]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey has seen remarkable economic growth and development since 2001, which has been grounded in fundamental economic reforms and sound policies. Turkey's resilience during the global crisis and post-crisis recovery owe much to these sound policies and its strong macroeconomic and structural position entering the crisis. Continued sound macroeconomic policies, the implementation of structural reforms to establish an enabling investment climate, coupled with progress in energy and advances in human development, especially education and skills, will also be the basis for Turkey's economic success in the future. Accelerating reforms in the areas of the business regulatory framework, labor market, and facilitating innovation will help enhance Turkey's competitiveness in an ever more competitive world. The World Bank is proud to be a partner with Turkey on this path of reform and growth.<br></p><p>Turkey's ongoing partnership with the World Bank is grounded in the country's Ninth Development Plan (2007-2013). The 2008-11 Country Partnership Strategy provides for up to $8.1 billion in new financing, of which $6.5 billion had been committed by November 2010, along with a range of analytical work, technical assistance, and international expertise and experience to inform Turkish policymaking and programs. In response to the global financial crisis the World Bank committed $3 billion in financing for Turkey between July 2009 and June 2010. A new Turkey-World Bank Strategy for 2012-15 is currently under preparation.</p><p>In 2010, Turkey experienced a robust recovery from the global economic turmoil, with real GDP growth estimated at around 8%, mainly driven by domestic consumption and investment demand from the private sector. Over the medium term, the Bank expects a potential growth rate of up to 5% relying on a combination of slowly recovering exports and private sector led domestic demand. With inflation at 6.4% in December 2010, the central bank met its inflation target in a difficult environment, with a high volume of portfolio flows coming into the Turkish economy. External imbalances remain a source of potential vulnerability over the medium term. As growth has revived, Turkey's current account deficit has grown as well and it is expected to be in the order of 6% of GDP in 2010. The authorities and the Bank are monitoring the current account deficit carefully. Indications so far suggest that it is financeable, as recently issued 10-year euro-denominated treasury bonds have yielded 4.25%, the lowest ever.</p><p>Like in many other countries, in Turkey small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute the backbone of the economy, playing a vital role in the welfare of the population as the main source of job creation and economic growth. In Turkey, SMEs account for 80% of employment, almost half of total investments, two-thirds of total retail sales, 25-30% of total exports, and one-quarter of bank credit. Therefore, Turkey's prosperity is inextricably linked to the fortunes of its SMEs. SMEs suffered more than their larger counterparts in the economic downturn of 2008-2009, with many of them seeing sales drop and their sources of finance dry up. With Turkey's economic recovery now well underway, SMEs will benefit as well, but the structural challenges they face remain.</p><p>In early 2010, the government and the Bank completed the study Turkey: Investment Climate Assessment—From Crisis to Private Sector Led Growth, based on a survey of 1,200 firms conducted between April 2008 and January 2009. The study examined various constraints to higher growth facing not only Turkish SMEs, but all firms in general. The study found strong indications that SMEs are disproportionately burdened by business regulations, face severe access to finance constraints, and seem to lack the ability to adopt and use the knowledge needed to make them and, ultimately, the entire Turkish economy more competitive internationally. Specifically,</p><p>•A majority of surveyed firms see themselves as held back by problems with access to finance (26% of firms cited this as their single most important constraint). Tax rates (18%) and policy instability (18%) rank second and third, while other important factors are competition from the informal sector and an inadequately educated workforce (15 and 9%, respectively).</p><p>•The survey found that the top management in enterprises spends a strikingly high amount of time (27%) dealing with red tape. Some of this “time tax" relates to frequent changes in rules and a discretionary, unpredictable implementation of rules, be it for taxes, for licenses, for procurement, or other transactions. This is much more than in comparator countries such as Brazil (19%), Hungary (13%), Poland (13%), Bulgaria (11%), Czech Republic (10%), and Romania and Chile (both 9%).</p><p>•Finally, nearly a quarter of Turkish large firms surveyed rated the education and skill levels of the workforce as a “major" or “very severe" constraint on operations and growth.</p><p>The results of the study and the underlying survey identify the business regulatory environment and the innovation policy framework as key areas for further improving the Turkish investment climate, economic growth, and employment generation. To be sure, over the past decade, Turkey has made significant investment climate reforms, including easing business registration. But red tape still seems to impose significant costs on businesses, especially SMEs. For instance, the progress that has been made in the granting of operating licenses to manufacturing firms—from 66 days in 2005 to 62 days in 2008—is still not sufficient to match comparator countries, including Bulgaria (21 days) and Romania (24 days). The government and the Bank are currently preparing a regulatory reform strategy with the goal of simplifying business regulations, including improved horizontal and vertical coordination among levels of government, and enhanced consultation with the private sector. In addition, long-term economic growth will benefit critically from concerted efforts to stimulate—and protect—knowledge and innovation. This “silent" engine of prosperity will be key  in spurring sustained wealth and growth  in Turkey and lead to the expansion of an internationally competitive SME sector that can complement its already successful and globally integrated large corporations.</p><p>Turkey has also made considerable progress in other key policy areas critical for achieving equitable and sustainable growth, including in energy, and health and education, although challenges remain there as well.</p><p>The World Bank has been assisting Turkey in developing its renewable energy capacity through policy advisory work, development policy lending, as well as through investment lending. Advisory work has included support for the modernization of the transmission grid to enable the integration of large-scale renewable capacity, plus initially in developing the renewable energy legislation. A series of policy-based loans supporting the energy sector and environmental sustainability also buttress the establishment of market-friendly policies in renewable energy. Finally, the Bank is also helping through financing private sector investment for renewable energy development. Under the Renewable Energy Project, for example, a $200 million Bank loan leveraged an additional $555 million in private investment to finance 618.5 MW of new renewable energy capacity. Thereafter, under the Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project, a $500 million Bank loan and $100 million from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) was used to continue financing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Turkey was the first country to utilize CTF funds. As of end-September 2010, this project had financed 2,118 MW of renewable capacity under construction.</p><p>Turkey has achieved much in establishing universal health service provision, taking measures to put social security on a sustainable path, and to broaden pre-school and basic education, which benefit all Turkish people across the country and different groups in society. Life expectancy at birth in 2008 at 73.6 years stood at 92.8% of the OECD average, compared with 71% in 1960. Considerable progress has been made in reducing the maternal mortality ratio (maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), which fell from 29 deaths in 2005 to 23 deaths in 2008, thus meeting its Millennium Development Goals target for 2015. The infant mortality rate (IMR) has declined from 150 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 19.9 per 1,000 live births in 2008. With 87% health insurance coverage of the population and low out-of-pocket payments for health (2.2% of total household spending), Turkey already provides affordable health care to nearly all its population. As health expenditures by the Social Security Institution grew by 30% in 2006, 11% in 2007, 27% in 2008, and 13.6% in 2009, keeping health spending affordable, though maintaining high-quality health services for the Turkish people will be  a challenge.</p><p>The recent Program for International Student Assessment scores show significant education gains in Turkey between 2006 and 2009. Turkey has almost universal primary school enrollment (net enrollment of 98.2% in 2009-10) and has significantly improved secondary school enrollment (65% net enrollment rate in 2009-10), although enrollment varies by region and by gender within certain regions. Nevertheless, enrollment rates in pre-school and tertiary education (around 27%) remain low by international standards and vary by region and by gender within certain regions. Moreover, a high proportion of 15-year-olds in Turkey continue to perform below the most basic proficiency level in reading, math, and science (25%, 30%, and 42%, respectively), with significant differences by region, socioeconomic status, and school type. Increasing educational attainment while reducing disparities and providing quality educational services are key challenges  for Turkey.</p><p>Turkey's extraordinarily dynamic entrepreneur class is a major comparative advantage, along with its geographical position. In our day-to-day work in Turkey, we come across many examples of companies and entrepreneurs in Turkey that, provided with the right policy framework (and some modest medium-term financing), can help enhance Turkey's global competitiveness and move it into the next stage of development. One of them is Altes Aluminium in Ankara. Its founders—best friends and partners for 30 years—are passing the torch to their children who, in search of injecting dynamism and innovation into the company, obtained a loan through one of the Bank-supported credit lines. There are many “Altes Aluminiums" in Turkey, and much can be done to improve their growth and innovative capacity, especially by eliminating regulatory barriers to growth and higher employment and in improving the quality of education and level of skills of the labor force they require.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2011 for Doğuş Otomotiv?</h4><p>It was a very good year for the industry. The growth rate was better than expected, and by the end of the year total sales were around 870,000 units. If you include commercial units, it was over 900,000, which is a record high for Turkey. Almost 70% of these sales were imported vehicles—30% were locally produced as Turkey is one the world's major automotive exporters. All in all, for the manufacturing industry, it was a record high year. We are very satisfied. Actually, it could have been better, but because of the heavy pressures on exchange rates total sales were a little bit less than they could have been. Analysts were expecting around 1 million units, but we ended up with around 870,000. Doğuş Otomotiv is the premier importer and distributor of Volkswagen Group vehicles and that includes all the Volkswagen brands, such as Audi, Porsche, Seat, Scania, Lamborghini, Bentley, and Bugatti as well. The flagship of our business is Volkswagen itself. The total volume of our sales was about 110,000. In other words, we also increased our market share within the Turkish local market. In terms of sales and market penetration, it was a good year for us as well.</p><h4>What are the strengths that helped you overcome the lira's devaluation versus the dollar?</h4><p>Turkey has a very young population, with many new households. It's a growing economy, and there is a high demand for cars. Turkey is far behind some countries in Europe and the Middle East in terms of car sales. Turkey is the 17th largest economy in the world, but car ownership rates are lower here than even in Hungary. In the US, for example, every 1,000 citizens own about 800 cars. In Europe, it's 600. But in Turkey it's about 160 per 1,000 people. We are far behind, and I'm sure if the economy were more stable, with more production, there would be a heavy demand for cars. It will be a growing environment, depending on the financing, current accounts, and import capability of the country.</p><div class="quote">“A 'national car' could be designed for medium- to lower-income groups."</div><h4>What major trends can you identify within the Turkish market?</h4><p>Commercial vehicles make up 30%-35% of total sales. There are two reasons behind that. First of all, there is a tax incentive. In Turkey, there are very high taxes in the car market; not only for imported cars, but domestic cars as well. This is called the Special Consumption Tax, which can be as high as 120%. If you would like to buy a ‚¬200,000 Bentley in Turkey, you can only buy it for ‚¬500,000. But, of course, this is not the bulkiest part of the market. Medium- to high-income level individuals are buying family-type passenger cars, such as the Volkswagen Polo or Golf. They also purchase from the competitors, such as Fiat, Ford, and Renault. They choose smaller engine vehicles, up to 1.6 liters. The luxury segment is relatively small, something like 15% of total sales. We consider Audi a part of the luxury segment. On the passenger car side, usually diesel engines with automatic transmissions are in the highest demand. In terms of local production, most of it is focused on commercial vehicles for both local and export markets. All of the main brands, such as Ford, Fiat, and Renault, are being manufactured in Turkey. The reason that they are focused on commercial vehicles is that the Special Consumption Tax on this vehicle type is something like 15%, which is much less than that of passenger cars. Another reason is that there are a growing number of small entrepreneurs and they would like to buy a car and use it for their business during the daytime, and for their family in the evening. It helps both personal and business needs. We finance most of these cars. Most of the financing demand is for small- to medium-sized vehicles. Most Lamborghini customers, for example, make a purchase simply by using cash. But these are pretty expensive vehicles. They are very high end on the scale. In 2011 we sold six Lamborghinis and 10 Bentleys. We know all of our customers and their family members, because there are so few sales.</p><h4>How have you diversified to combat an over-reliance on imports?</h4><p>We have six retail outlets in Turkey, and we are doing almost 30% of imported car sales through our own outlets. We operate DOD, which is a used car-trading brand. We have financial services in three areas: insurance, car financing, and leasing. We also operate Tüvturk, a vehicle inspection system in Turkey.  We are a 33% shareholder in Tüvturk, and we cover inspections all around Turkey. And the last business is industrial, and we have two factories.  First of all we produce for the local market, and then for countries in our region. The capacity of our trailer factory in Tire is about 10,000 units, and we're going to start production in 2012. Our factory in Sakarya, outside of Istanbul, is for tipper trucks, and the total capacity is 3,000 units. Right now we are manufacturing around 800 a year, which we mostly sell to the local market. Depending on Europe's recovery, our main intention is to export our products to other countries. The only exception is car manufacturing, which we don't operate as we are a distributor for Volkswagen. It's a pretty diverse, large-scale company. Through all of these partnerships, we are the minority shareholder, but we have equal rights to manage. We have a 49% share in these investments.</p><h4>What impact would a Turkish-branded car have on the market?</h4><p>It would have a positive impact. According to the government's target for 2023, Turkey is going to be one of the world's leading economies, and car manufacturing will be a very important component of the country's industry. A “national car" could be designed for medium- to lower-income groups. This would make sense, because Turkey is a young country with a growing economy.  This should be a brand for the mass market, and it should be relatively affordable for medium-income groups. Now, if you would like to buy an average car in Turkey, it costs something like ‚¬20,000. For a young graduate or a young couple, this money is impossible even to borrow. There should be an affordable vehicle for them, in terms of cost and insurance. If it happens, it will bring us an additional capacity for the Turkish market, and it will be good for the existing brands as well. As new customers enter the marketplace, I'm sure that at the next opportunity they would like to upgrade their vehicles. They'll go and buy a Toyota, a Volkswagen, or another vehicle.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Airbus has taken orders for almost 1,000 aircraft in the MENA region since it began operations.  What is the significance of this market in terms of the company's global operations?</h4><p>The Middle East has in many ways become a leader in global aviation, and has always shown a strong desire to grow its aviation footprint, not just regionally, but globally as well. At Airbus, we strongly believe in the region's strengths, which is why we established a fully fledged subsidiary here—Airbus Middle East—in 2006, and our global market forecast predicts that the Middle East will take 7% of the world's aircraft deliveries between 2011 and 2030.</p><h4>Dubai has become a hub for the entire aviation industry and the company's regional headquarters is located in the Dubai Airport Freezone (DAFZ). What are the main strengths of the Emirate?</h4><p>Dubai's main strengths are in its perfect geographical location between East and West, which enables it to act as a vital passenger and cargo hub between Asia and Europe, and its rich aviation history—everything from the original airport in 1959, to the opening of the Middle East's largest airport—at the time—in 1971, and the founding of Emirates Airlines, now one of the largest airlines in the world. Dubai also has some of the best transport logistics systems in the region, making it a natural place for Airbus to maintain both a commercial office, as well as a material and logistics center, and training team.</p><div class="quote">“The Dubai Airshow has firmly established itself as one of the top airshows in the world."</div><h4>Airbus received firm orders for 135 aircraft at the Dubai Airshow, worth $13.7 billion. How important is the event to Airbus?</h4><p>The Dubai Airshow has firmly established itself as one of the top airshows in the world, and it's always an important and exciting event for Airbus. In 2011 we were very pleased with the results, such as the orders from Qatar Airways for 50 A320neo aircraft and five A380s, and from ALAFCO for 50 A320neo aircraft, which had an additional 35 added to it at the recent Singapore Airshow. We're very much looking forward to 2013, and we hope to replicate the great success that we had in 2011.</p><h4>A high demand for Airbus's lower cost, single-aisle aircraft were to thank for such sales figures at the airshow. Will you be ramping up the production of wide-bodied aircraft?</h4><p>Each Airbus aircraft has its unique place in the market, and with the recent expansion of many short-to mid-range carriers, we've seen excellent sales of the A320neo, which offers more than 15% fuel savings with its new generation engines and large wingtip devices called “sharklets." However, mid-to long-range flights are also growing in number, which is why the A380 has remained so popular with larger carriers, and why the new A350 XWB program, which will offer 25% fuel savings compared to the competition, is a success, with over 550 of the aircraft ordered to date. The A350 XWB entry into service will be in the first half of 2014, with Qatar Airways as the launch customer.</p><h4>What does the new Airbus Corporate Jets business unit offer to customers?</h4><p>Airbus offers the most modern and comprehensive corporate jet family in the world, giving customers the greatest choice of the widest and most spacious cabins. The company's corporate jets range from the Airbus ACJ318 all the way to the double-deck ACJ380, allowing customers to select the comfort they want in the size that they need. Since our corporate jets are based on our passenger jet designs, they offer the tallest and widest, and therefore the most comfortable, cabins available on the corporate jet market. We also offer a wide range of interior design options to suit any need, from business to personal luxury.</p><h4>The company has a number of development programs in place, representing a huge investment and high risk for Airbus—how confident are you of being able to deliver these programs on time?</h4><p>We are extremely confident in both the A320neo and A350 XWB programs, and the way in which they are already changing the industry. The A320neo is already the fastest selling aircraft of all time, with 1,226 orders made in 2011, and the A350 XWB, which comes in three sizes, will offer airlines so many distinct advantages, from fuel savings, to commonality of design, to flexibility with range, cabin arrangement, and cargo space. The A350 XWB family truly is an aircraft doing the job of two competing aircraft families.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the Central Bank of Turkey's policy of cutting interest rates and raising capital reserve requirements?</h4><p>It is a new policy. Normally the policy of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) was price stability. Price stability was perceived as something local, and previously only inflation and growth expectations were taken into account. This is the first time the bank has considered external factors such as capital inflows. This new policy is not based only on interest rates, but also reserve requirements. It is considered that capital inflows create pressure on the Turkish lira, and thus are a factor in the current account deficit. The CBT believes that by decreasing interest rates, the account deficit issue will be alleviated. When interest rates are decreased, this will also stimulate local demand, and this will be compensated for by increasing reserve requirements. We cannot predict the overall effect. However, we know that it will have an effect on the Turkish lira. The lira has been overvalued, and this year its valuation will drop.</p><h4>What is your outlook for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) in Turkey?</h4><p>In 2010 we saw the highest levels of M&amp;As in Turkish history. One reason behind this was the presence of major energy privatization deals, increasing the value of M&amp;As to $25 billion. The other specific reason was the Garanti Bank deal, which saw BBVA buy a large share in the bank. In 2011 we expect the market to remain lively in various sectors. The total amount will most likely be around $15 billion. There are still some privatization deals to be done in the energy sector, as well as motorways and ports. Privatization efforts began in the early 1980s, around the same time as in the UK. In the last few years the Turkish government has sold off a number of large assets. The second phase is now beginning, and concession businesses will be sold. There is great interest in these deals, and the prices are higher than our expectations. Private equity companies have just started to work on Turkey. At first, companies based in the US and UK discovered Turkey and began to invest, then companies from the Gulf and Russia entered the market. These companies are just beginning to invest again following the crisis and will continue to invest in the country.</p><h4>İş Bank was one of the first private banks to sell Turkish lira-denominated bonds. Can you tell us a little about these activities?</h4><p>Until the mid-1990s Turkey had a very active Turkish lira bond market. After the 1994 Turkish financial crisis, due to tax regulations and high interest rates, this market became inactive. A few years ago the tax regime changed, and interest rates decreased again. This led to a reopening of the market. Three years ago we issued the first Turkish lira bond, and 2010 was an active year that saw us close six deals. These bonds are traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and are real moneymakers. We see this trend continuing. This year most large banks have announced that they will issue Turkish lira bonds, as well as some of the smaller sized banks. This market will continue to be dominated by the banking industry.</p><h4>The Turkish market has seen a high level of IPOs in 2010. What is your outlook for the IPO market in the medium term?</h4><p>In the first half of the year there was a demand for IPOs in the capital markets. However, due to market conditions, and the problems the euro and eurozone countries faced, demand was fragile. Funds in Europe were reluctant to subscribe to IPOs and due to various economic reasons and uncertainty they preferred to wait. In the second half of 2010 the picture changed. We saw higher subscription levels for Turkish IPOs, and companies believed in the strength of the Turkish economy despite the global economic woes. IPOs thus became very successful, and we believe this trend will continue over 2011. A few months ago we closed a deal for Do &amp; Co, a catering company. This company is based in Austria and had traded on the Vienna stock exchange. The main shareholder, however, is Turkish and at the IPO we sold ‚¬65 million worth of stock, and it was 15 times oversubscribed. This example shows the level of appetite.</p><h4>What is behind this high investor interest and confidence in the Turkish story?</h4><p>Generally, the economies of countries in this region are based on natural resources. Turkey has the only economy that is based on production. Turkey produces everything. There are many companies in each industry, and each industry exports. The economy is highly diversified, and there is no single driving force. This is the main advantage of this country.</p><h4>What structural weaknesses can you identify in the Turkish economy?</h4><p>The main challenge is the current account deficit. Our exports are growing, yet our imports are also growing. This poses a challenge for Turkey and for the region as a whole. Our economy is reliant on imports. We have few natural energy resources and must import. A steel company, for example, needs scrap and energy. It imports scrap, produces steel, and then exports it. This is the main characteristic of  this country.</p><h4>Do you see Turkey's investment grade improving in the near future?</h4><p>Yes, I believe it will increase. We now have better economic figures, and our economic indicators are stronger than some nations in Europe. We are still one or two notches below investment grade level. We believe the ratings systems must be changed, as previously identified hurdles to increasing the rating, such as the budget deficit, have been solved. Yet Turkey's rating remains lower than it should be. After the inevitable upgrade, we don't believe we will see a major difference for the first few years. From an investor point of view, Turkey's future is bright, and the investment rating is not considered. Currently, foreigners hold 67% of equities on the stock market, and they make up around 20% of the trading volume each day. So, they are not trading actively, and are holding onto their positions. Five years from now they will still be holding onto their positions. Some of them will sell into the good news, but I believe Turkey's banking bond rates already reflect that we are at investment grade. Five years down the line an increased rating will begin to attract more FDI, and this is the long-term effect we hope to see.</p><h4>What are İş Investment's main operations, and what are your visions for the future of the company?</h4><p>More and more capital market products such as futures, capital guaranteed funds, warrants, and hedge funds came to the market after regulatory changes. Another trend is the sophistication of the capital markets. We are the leader of the industry and the largest investment house in Turkey. As interest rates decline, clients will look for new ways to invest and we will be pioneering new products. We will continue to be leaders in the equity, fixed income, and derivatives markets. We are trying to create a bond market in the country following the six deals we made in 2010. This year we will see the options market boom, and we will be very active in that area too. We have the most comprehensive collection of services, including a portfolio management arm and a specific private equity company. We have offices outside of Turkey in Almaty and London, and we are about to open another office in Dubai. We expect further regulations to open the fixed market, allowing us to perform leveraged fixed transactions. We are investing heavily in technology, and our electronic platform will improve. It is now possible to use the iPad and soon the iPhone to perform transactions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the final results of private banks in Ecuador in 2011?</h4><p>The year 2011 was very positive for the banking sector in Ecuador; the banks reached significant levels of liquidity, and we saw significant growth in loan portfolios. The financial system remains very liquid, with a clear solidity and solvency above locally and internationally required levels. In general, it was a very successful year in terms of consolidating the results from 2009 and 2008, when the sector got back on its feet following the aftershocks of the crisis.</p><h4>What characterizes the loan portfolio in the country?</h4><p>The Superintendency of Banks and Insurance of Ecuador divides the loan portfolio into the following categories: commercial nomenclature (including corporate, SMEs, and micro enterprises); consumer lines (including credit cards and car loans); residential mortgages and loans for housing; and microfinance credits. The main focus of the banking sector is on credit volumes for commercial-type loans, followed by consumer loans, and finally mortgages and microcredits. In 2011, consumer loans experienced significant growth driven by liquidity, as well as the increase in the employment rate and purchasing power of the country's population. Ecuador also saw record car sales in 2011, and an increase in the credit card penetration rate among customers.</p><div class="quote">“We have experienced an increase in the penetration of banking products due to economic development."</div><h4>What is the Ecuadorean market's demand for new products?</h4><p>The Ecuadorean financial market operates through a fairly rigid scheme, with ceiling controls on rates and tariff controls on financial services and other products. These factors inhibit innovation and price competition via the creation of new products. However, the regulations contribute to the management of risk and liquidity, and we have experienced an increase in the penetration of banking products due to economic development, and in the demand for consumer and car loans, credit cards, and mortgages.</p><h4>How have banking rates evolved in 2011?</h4><p>Banking rates in 2011 were very steady and stable; on the active side, rates have a ceiling, and on the passive side, rates showed a tendency toward moderate growth due to taxes on foreign exchange capital outflows. Active rates have been steady over the last few years, with a slight drop between 2009 and 2010 from 9% to the current 8.2%, which is actually the benchmark rate set by the Central Bank for corporate loans. Such rates are also set for consumer loans, mortgage loans, and microcredits.</p><h4>What are your views on the anti-monopoly law passed by the government at the end of 2011?</h4><p>Currently, the sector is undergoing a timetable to comply with the new law, with the deadline set for July 12, 2012. The Ecuadorean banking sector was allowed to form financial groups, and the bank was the financial head of a group with fully regulated and controlled subsidiaries such as insurance companies, mutual fund administrators, and brokerage firms—as in many parts of the world. In developing a reform of the securities market law, the regulators defined that it was detrimental for the development of a capital market to have the banks as direct participants. Given the size of the Ecuadorean securities market and its development, we believe that such a reform goes against the deepening of the market, because banks have led the market's development historically with our corporate clients. The brokerage arms of each bank have helped their corporate customers in structuring and leading them to the market, while managing their consolidated risk in a very responsible way. Additionally, insurance is an interesting part of the financial sector.</p><h4>How is the new law affecting the restructuring of the sector?</h4><p>Currently, mutual funds are being liquidated and customers are reluctant to leave their money in the hands of companies other than their trusted banks, and that liquidity is going back to the banking sector. Therefore, the funds used to invest in the capital or money markets run the risk that volumes will contract in the near future. On top of that, there are other issues to be discussed in the field of insurance, and banks are defending the principles of their work. At the moment, the impact on the Ecuadorean financial system and banking sector is not very significant, because businesses related to the securities market do not represent a large percentage of overall business activity. The same happens with the administration of mutual fund lines. They are not the main business activity of the Ecuadorean banks, and therefore the law will not have a huge impact on the generation of revenue and profits.</p><h4>What opportunities does the context of the new law offer for foreign investors?</h4><p>Although the main international insurance companies are already in the Ecuadorean market, I believe that the insurance market still offers opportunities for foreign investors. We may see a number of international companies enter the market, which will lead to the concentration and strengthening of the sector. Regarding fund management, there are investment opportunities for companies operating under brands that generate confidence among customers. Such opportunities may come about while working with local banks, which manage the most important customer base.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the finance sector in 2012?</h4><p>By the end of 2011, we had seen a lot of movement within the sector. For example, Banco de Guayaquil sold its insurance company. We expect to see many similar transactions until the schedule of compliance with the new anti-monopoly law comes to fruition. Additionally, licenses related to fiduciary business activities will be sold, which will drive the consolidation of the sector. With regard to the securities market, we expect dramatic consolidation in the sector, although it has no depth of players; there are far too many for the small size of the market.</p><h4>What segments has Promerica Ecuador specialized in?</h4><p>Over the last decade, we have diversified our product portfolio from a consumer point of view to a more commercial and corporate bank approach. Currently, our customer portfolio is split 50% consumer and 50% corporate. The bank is engaged in a wide range of activities, and we aim to strengthen and further expand our branch network in order to reach more retail customers in the near future and increase our customer base. Today, Promérica is among the 10 largest banks in the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the resilience of the Turkish banking sector?</h4><p>Thanks to solid capital cushions, lack of exposure to toxic assets, prudent regulatory oversight, and a flexible liquidity management framework, the banking sector was able to support the rapid recovery in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers' crisis. Lately, as the worries surrounding European banks regarding the tightening strains on funding and capital adequacy escalated, Turkish banks remain relatively safe from these concerns. Despite having close financial connections with the European banking sector, the Turkish banks could comfortably roll over their external debt in excess of 100%. Turkish banks enjoy a large domestic market, rapid population growth, and low penetration, providing reasonable growth prospects. In addition, the new policy mix implemented by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) led to the longer maturity of banking system liabilities and supported financial stability via tools used to restrain excessive credit growth. These prudent policies will serve as a buffer in the face of rapidly changing global market conditions.</p><div class="quote">“Our medium-term outlook comprises of sustainable growth that creates employment while preserving price and financial stability."</div><h4>How would you assess the country's foreign currency position compared to its short-term debt?</h4><p>In Turkey, households have a long FX position due to the fact FX loans to households are not allowed, while FX deposits are permitted. Considering firms, balance sheets indicate open positions. Nevertheless, this is stock data. The flow of FX revenues should also be taken into account since many of these companies are exporters and FX earners, providing them with a natural hedge. The main risk factor in many countries is the FX debt of households and consumers, which is negligible in Turkey.</p><h4>What is your view of the current strength of the lira following significant depreciation in the latter half of 2011, and what steps is the CBRT taking to mitigate excessive exchange rate volatility?</h4><p>The depreciation in the Turkish lira observed until August 2011 was initiated by the new policy mix of low short-term rates and high reserve requirements. This has contributed significantly to our export competitiveness, the rebalancing of the economy, and the normalization of the current account deficit. Following escalating concerns over financial strains in Europe around August 2011, international investors have resorted to the safe haven of US-dollar assets. This trend led to a rapid depreciation in all emerging market currencies and a further undesired depreciation of the Turkish lira. The policy measures taken by the CBRT since August have alleviated the adverse effects of global fluctuations on the Turkish economy, which emerged in parallel to uncertainties in the European economy. The CBRT's measures regarding foreign exchange liquidity and decisions related to hikes in the interest rate corridor in August and October reduced the extent of volatility in the exchange rate compared to that of other emerging market economies.</p><h4>Turkey's current account deficit is a noted concern for foreign investors. Can the deficit be reasonably reduced and sustained at a level to moderate these concerns?</h4><p>The outcome of the policy measures that we have taken so far is becoming more visible, as can be seen through recent data releases. The rebalancing between domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. Final domestic demand is decelerating and the contribution of net external demand to growth is increasing. Accordingly, the rebalancing process and an improvement in the current account deficit is expected to continue in the coming months.</p><h4>Foreign investors around the world are apprehensive about the possibility of a new financial crisis in the international market. How do you reassure them that Turkey is a secure place for investment?</h4><p>Solid fundamentals, robust growth, and prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies could be the key for a successful de-coupling of emerging market economies in 2012. For the Turkish economy in particular, we think the 4% growth of the “Medium Term Plan" for this year is achievable thanks to the success of our exporters in improved market diversification and enhanced competitiveness provided by the exchange rate, despite the downside risks due to the negative outlook for the EU. Considering the monetary policy measures taken to bring inflation back to its 5% target, the rebalancing of external and domestic demand, a robust financial system, and prudent policies of the policy makers, Turkey will continue to perform well in 2012 as well.</p><h4>What are your monetary policy priorities looking forward?</h4><p>Policies implemented by the CBRT since the last quarter of 2010 have mitigated macro financial risks and contributed to the rebalancing of the economy. Still, the intensification of the financial turmoil in August 2011 led to excessive volatility in emerging market currencies and created inflationary pressures despite a global slowdown. In order to prevent the worsening of the price setting behavior due to surging inflation, the CBRT has delivered strong monetary tightening since October 2011. Accordingly, the interest rate corridor was widened upward and the cost of funding provided to the market was raised significantly. Moreover, with the aim of minimizing the adverse effects of abrupt changes in capital flows due to uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook, a flexible liquidity management strategy was designed and implemented. These measures limited the excessive depreciation of the Turkish lira while containing inflation expectations. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving financial stability as a supplementary objective. The CBRT will do its best to mitigate the adverse effects of volatility in capital flows. However, it should be underscored that continuous coordination among monetary, fiscal, and financial sector policies is crucial, especially within such a challenging global backdrop. For the medium and longer term, strengthening structural reforms aimed at reducing the savings deficit would boost the resilience of the economy and reinforce sustainable growth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish economy in the medium term?</h4><p>Our medium-term outlook comprises of sustainable and healthy growth that creates employment while preserving price and financial stability. Strengthening the structural reform agenda would ensure the sustainability of fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit to support the relative improvement of Turkey's sovereign risk, and thus facilitate price stability and financial stability in the medium term. This will also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and contribute to social welfare by reducing the risk premium on government securities further. In this respect, steps toward the implementation of structural reforms envisaged by the Medium Term Program remain of utmost importance.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Kcell sought to strengthen its local market share over 2011?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Kcell has focused on strengthening its market position, leading to a dramatic evolution within our business. Our clients are the company's main focus, which results in positive feedback from our subscriber base and has led to an increase in subscriptions; in 2011, we reached a total of nearly 11 million users. To maintain our success over the long term, we came to the conclusion that there is a need for innovation. Kcell's previous business transformation was innovative, but the changes came from the top down—now, employees at the base of our workforce must become the catalysts of innovation and be the promoting engine. At present, we are at the beginning of a long process, and 2011 was the starting point for this inspiring journey. An active increase in data traffic was another important factor for Kcell's development in 2011, and our company set the trend in the market for mobile data services. We launched a number of revolutionary offers that made mobile internet available to the masses at very low costs. At the same time, we have been working to improve our mobile data speed, actively developing the 3G network, and increasing the mobile data speeds on the 2G network (EDGE). The next step was to expand the availability of smart phones. This strategy led to an increase in the number of mobile data services users, which exceeded 6 million in January 2012.</p><h4>How do you see Kcell and Activ complementing with each other, as far as presence in the market is concerned?</h4><p>We very clearly positioned our two main brands; Kcell is the corporate segment brand, and Activ is geared toward the mass market. This segmentation allowed us to consider subscriber needs and efficiently respond to market changes. A strongly positioned brand in the mass segment, with its wide portfolio of tariffs, made it possible for us to successfully compete without additional effort or extra financial expenses.</p><div class="quote">“The main trend we have observed in Kazakhstan is the explosive growth of data traffic."</div><h4>What are some highlights from your infrastructure development in 2011? Which direction are you planning to take with capital expenditure in 2012?</h4><p>As of January 1, 2012, the Kcell network covered 4,917 population centers in Kazakhstan. This means that there are communication services in all major cities, and towns with populations of between 5,000 and 10,000 people, and in almost every village with populations starting from 1,000 people. Taking into account the territory of Kazakhstan—the 9th largest country in the world by land area—we feel that tremendous achievements have been accomplished. At present, Kcell ensures the coverage of 44.4% of the country, which is more than 94% of its population. Our plan for 2012 includes the completion of mobile communications coverage in smaller villages; ensuring mobile communication in rural areas is one of our most important social tasks. Moreover, we will proceed with further network developments, aiming to provide high-quality voice and data services for the people of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How has 3G changed the dynamics of the industry? What major trends have you observed in the market?</h4><p>Lately, the main trend we have observed in Kazakhstan is the explosive growth of data traffic. The long-awaited 3G launch back in January 2011 greatly contributed to our success. The company centers its efforts on the latest version of 3G, HSPA+. This technology has a maximum speed of up to 21 Mbps. At present, the average speed on the Kcell 3G network reaches 14 Mbps. In an effort to spread 3G throughout more regional centers by the end of 2011, Kcell 3G was operating in 31 cities and regional centers across Kazakhstan. We are now working to make 3G devices readily available to the masses. To do this, we have begun to offer telephones under a contract-based program, which has been a tried and tested model in most European countries. This program was implemented in Kazakhstan for the first time, and it has fostered the growth of our customer base.</p><h4>What is the level of progress and readiness in terms of new technology? What is the potential for 4G in your industry?</h4><p>Our viewpoint on the issue of implementing 4G/LTE in Kazakhstan is fairly simple. We believe that this technology should achieve the stage that we can characterize as “commercial maturity." This maturity refers to both providers of equipment and manufacturers of subscriber devices. There is also the issue of private standardization, as in Europe, the US, Russia, and India. I strongly agree with the opinion of many sector experts, who believe that the current LTE standard being implemented in several countries has no significant advantages over 3G/HSPA+ in terms of mobile data speed. As soon as 4G/LTE becomes a cost-effective project for Kazakhstan from a commercial viewpoint, Kcell will consider the possibility of its implementation.</p><h4>Do you see changes in the composition and share distribution of the market benefiting customers in cost terms over the long term?</h4><p>The average cost of one minute on our network is about KZT10, less than $0.10. There are tariff offers that lower the cost up to KZT1. We operate in a market of about 17 million people, and if we compare our mobile tariffs with those in China or India, there will certainly be differences. I would like to emphasize that over the past several years, the average cost of one minute on our network has been reduced significantly, and the cost reduction trend can still be observed. Our EPSI rating and research demonstrates the level of satisfaction from our clients, including criteria based on value for money; Kcell customer satisfaction remains the highest in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How does the availability of social networking through 3G affect the demand for SMS services?</h4><p>The usage of SMS services will contract due to the onset of smartphone applications. The general trend is that people tend to use applications more than SMS. Of course, the penetration of 3G-compatible phones on operators' networks corresponds to just 20% of all phones, so there is still major potential for operators to plan accordingly and develop the appropriate applications. Smartphones are not included in this 20%, and they still represent less than 5% of total market penetration.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies did Ford México implemented during the global economic crisis of 2008?</h4><p>The reason why Ford didn't ask for support in terms of cash grants was because we had already raised enough funds to confront the storm by the time the crisis hit the US. We knew that something was coming; the economy was spiraling downward in many countries, not just in the US. We predicted that there would be a slowdown in the market, and that major restructuring would be required. In 2006-2007 we raised enough money to resize our company and survive the crisis. Fortunately, we choose the correct strategy and obtained the results we were expecting. We had excess capacity, particularly in the US. Therefore, we decided to shut down some plants. This action took place during 2007 and 2008. In total we shut down 16 plants in the US. As you can imagine, that required a lot of negotiations with the trade unions. We had to renegotiate our contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union. The UAW recognized that restructuring was required in order to survive. The conclusion we obtained from this was that it is better to have a smaller company than a bankrupt company. We put together the right plan that we shared with our stakeholders, and we managed to come back earlier and stronger than our two key competitors in the US, GM, and Chrysler. Our competitors had a harder time in obtaining money and support from the government, and make key decisions with their stakeholders. It was painful and difficult, but we gained market share in the US.</p><h4>What are the key elements of the “One Ford" initiative, and how is its implementation influencing your growth path?</h4><p>The plan is rather simple. When we restructured the company, we put together a five-year business plan. We set a series of intermediate goals for the period. We were rather conservative in our economic assumptions, and we created a very strong product plan. Through One Ford, we'll have a global team making decisions and plans. We have one goal for everybody. Our team is looking for automotive leadership based on customer, dealer, shareholder, and employee satisfaction. The team goes beyond the boundaries and limits for the company. The plan is also very simple; restructure the company to a size that can deal with the realities of the industry, make the company buyable, accelerate the development of new products, and raise the funds required to finance the restructuring of the company. We also have a set of values that conducts the way we behave and do business.</p><div class="quote">“Making our operations sustainable is key for our future."</div><h4>Ford in Mexico has registered consistent growth over recent quarters. What market segments are driving this growth?</h4><p>One thing that is important to mention is that we do not report growth from Mexico alone. We report as a region and as a company. In our reports, Mexico is included as a part of North America—besides this, there are three other regions around the world. We also have a consolidated report. We were expecting to repeat this growth in the fourth quarter of 2011, despite the difficulties that we were facing toward the end of that year, especially in Europe. In Mexico, we have been fairly stable over the past three years. We have restructured the company in order to operate more profitably. Most of the investment in Mexico has been dedicated to producing vehicles more efficiently, and meeting world-class standards in terms of safety, fuel efficiency, and design. In 2008, we announced an investment program of $5 billion, which this year is about to come to an end. It was based on increasing the capacity of the Hermosillo plant, the launch of the 2009 Fusion model, and a complete revamping of Cuautitlán, a plant to the north of Mexico City. Vehicles that are exported to other countries across the Americas are built at our Cuautitlán assembly facility. We completely restored the plant and installed new systems and equipment. It's almost completely new, even though it has been open for 50 years now. We produce 32 vehicles per hour, in two shifts, which cover 16 hours a day. Hermosillo almost doubles that capacity. It can produce 58 vehicles per hour over three shifts, six days a week. In 2011 Hermosillo produced approximately 320,000 units, and we are planning to increase production to between 345,000 and 350,000 units in 2012. This plant is the largest in Mexico, and it produces primarily for the US market. In 2009, we also built a second engine plant in Chihuahua, which we opened in 2009. Nowadays, we have two plants there that produce diesel engines.</p><h4>Why has Mexico become such a successful base for production?</h4><p>One factor is labor quality. Mexicans are very well educated, and it is very easy to get high-quality labor to operate the plants. A second factor is that labor costs are very competitive. As a result, Hermosillo has been used as a business model for the new plants that are being constructed by the company around the globe. We are building several plants in Asia, and a couple more in India and China. They will be built in the same manner as the one in Hermosillo, where the Fusion model is produced and has become one of the most successful vehicles in the US.</p><h4>What factors influence the purchasing decisions of Mexican consumers in the auto market?</h4><p>Affordability is the number one factor, and this is also the case for many countries in Latin America. Quality and safety are also key drivers, as well as fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency has to do with affordability, because at the end of the day it forms a part of a vehicle's operating costs.</p><h4>How is Ford's vehicle financing program assisting your sales?</h4><p>In 2009 we signed an agreement with BBVA Bancomer. It performs all our vehicle financing. In terms of credit assistance, we operate a wholesale financing arrangement with the dealers. This is an alliance we have been running for a little over a year. Financing as a percentage of total sales is growing, although not at the speed we would like it to. This has nothing to do with our ambitions or performance, but has more to do with the way the market is structured. Many things have to happen in order for the market to achieve a financing rate of 80%-90%, like in Brazil, the US, or Europe. It has to do with the level of access to banking services for both industry and the population.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of the hybrid and electric vehicle segment?</h4><p>Making our operations sustainable is key for our future. We need to fight global warming, and we should support the efforts that governments around the world are making. We also believe that there will be important purchasing decisions to be made in some markets, but we know that not all markets are the same. Some will take longer to make these decisions, depending on the level of sophistication, purchasing power, and income. Unfortunately, new technologies are not cheap. In 2010 the entire world produced 75 million vehicles, out of which just 1 million were hybrid or electric. Imagine the difference in economies of scale; we know how to produce a conventional vehicle cheaply, but we don't know how to produce an affordable hybrid. Until the scale of production grows, it will take a while before we can offer a competitive cost. That's why we have dedicated so much money and resources to improving the fuel efficiency and emission levels of conventional vehicles. We can do a lot more for the environment by simultaneously investing in hybrid technology and greener engines. It will be a while before hybrid and electric vehicles take a higher portion of vehicle sales.</p><h4>What has been the significance of Ford's engineering center in Mexico?</h4><p>We have 651 engineers, and as a result we thought it would be a good idea to have an engineering center in Mexico. Our ultimate aim is to have between 900 and 1,000 engineers. We have a well laid-out plan to increase their numbers over the coming years. The service quality provided by our engineering center has been recognized around the world, and it is producing the best vehicles in the market.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[back-in-the-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas is Dubai Investments currently focusing its investments?</h4><p>We have been mainly focusing on three sectors. In the manufacturing sector, we establish or buy existing manufacturing companies. We also have interests in property and real estate. The third sector is financial investments, which involves buying into equities in companies, bonds, and structured products.</p><h4>How have the recent geopolitical and global economic events affected your operations?</h4><p>With the economic crisis in 2008, followed by the global recession, and recently the “Arab spring," our businesses have been affected. The financial crisis has delayed our plans for expansion. Most countries that experienced the Arab spring are our business partners, and we have projects in Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Egypt that have been adversely affected over the last three years. However, Dubai Investments has managed to remain profitable with a high level of liquidity and we have been able to pay dividends to our shareholders. Even though it has taken a toll on our businesses, I think we have managed to remain robust.</p><div class="quote">“We can see now positive trends from all sectors of the economy, especially from manufacturing exports to other countries."</div><h4>What were some of the key strategies you applied to weather the financial storm?</h4><p>As an investment company, we always have 30% of our investments available to us in liquid form that we can tap into as and when the need arises. This has helped us wade through the financial storms, even when several banks shut down and tried to get help from the government instead of receiving a bail out from the private sector. We command a unique position among other companies that have built their strategies on leverage because at Dubai Investments we have very low leverage ratios. All of our investments are managed conservatively. Now, the situation has reversed and the banks are slowly but steadily opening up. We hope that if we can get that rolling, we will be able to boost our liquidity by investing in some companies in our portfolio. We are confident that we are heading in the right direction.</p><h4>What are some of your key future targets on the investment side?</h4><p>We have already started to go back to an open business model. We have borrowed around $200 million and we are working on borrowing another $350 million to cope with our expansion. We are back in the market. We are returning to our strategy of acquiring new companies and we have investors who are interested in investing in our portfolio. Additionally, we are performing evaluations and due diligence studies so as to possibly exit from the mature companies in our portfolio. In 2012-2013, we will be back to normal business practices, especially with the Arab spring more or less settled down. There are still a few countries where the political climate is grim, and we have taken that into account. Also, Dubai's economy has given us some positive signs and has demonstrated positive trends. The real estate market is recovering and the banks are funding companies and projects. Most companies have solid business plans that are focused on business prospects as opposed to speculation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Dubai Investments Park?</h4><p>The park is one of our most successful projects and has already reached capacity. There are not many opportunities for companies to come in and just lease land. However, if customers have not been able to deliver on their promises or deliver on their lease agreements, the space can be reassigned to other clients. We have been very active over the last year to develop our own activities in the park. For example, we have just completed Phase I of a logistics project in the park. It cost around $80 million and has already been developed and leased. Around 10%-15% of Phase II has also been completed. I think by the middle of 2013 this project will have been completed and leased out. We have built a hospital and leased it to a third party at a cost of around $25 million. We have developed major supermarkets and entered into a 20-year lease with Carrefour. We are also thinking of replicating the park somewhere else and have already received invitations from Libya and Iraq. We are now developing something similar on a smaller scale in Fujairah. We will use our expertise, our business plans, and our networking tools to build similar facilities in other locations. Some of our clients here have already indicated that if we build another park in another location, they would be happy to invest. It is highly likely that we will be expanding outside of the UAE.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012 for Dubai Investments and the wider economy?</h4><p>We can see now positive trends from all sectors of the economy, especially from manufacturing exports to other countries. On many occasions, even countries facing political upheaval have invited us to attend conferences and meetings, besides requesting us to come back with our business plans. We are now in the process of setting up agencies and representative offices in various countries, while our sales force is working hard to increase our market share in these countries. We already see positive financial rewards in the first quarter of 2012, and if the trend continues we are on the right track. We are confident that our second and third quarters will prove extremely positive.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Nature of the Need]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-nature-of-the-need]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4> How did Chagala decide to focus on its niche service areas?</h4><p>The company started operations in Atyrau in 1995. At that time, there were few options for accommodating the large in-bound work force drawn to the city by projects such as Tengizchevroil and the OKIOC (AGIP KCO/NCOC) project. There were no hotels of international standard. Chagala was established to address that need, and we quickly expanded into food services, office space, recreational facilities, and logistics, among others. We have focused our business model on the needs of the international and domestic oil companies and the service companies that support them. In doing so, we've also fostered an improved standard of living for the West Kazakhstan community in general. Not only by building the skills and providing employment for many Kazakhstanis, but also by bringing higher quality standards to the region. We understand the demands of today's oil companies, such as health and safety expectations, flexibility in service provision, cost effectiveness, and quality. We are always talking with our clients about their future needs.</p><h4>What are some highlights from Chagala's performance over 2011?</h4><p>It was a tough year for everyone. Because of our financial strength, minimal exposure to speculative development, and solid partnership with many of the country's largest projects, Chagala managed to cope with the challenges of a difficult market. Of particular note in 2011, we delivered our Ural Residence Block A in Atyrau. A 13-floor building, with 108 one- to three-bedroom suites, it is a level of quality never before seen in West Kazakhstan. We started construction on 33 four-bedroom townhouses in Atyrau with completion scheduled for the first quarter of 2012. All 33 are already leased on a long-term basis. We also made considerable progress on a corporate restructuring plan that will allow the company greater financial efficiencies and enable us to better respond to opportunities and challenges in the country. We see a very different market than we did just a few years ago, and we need to adapt to that new market quickly. I am pleased to say that I think we are adapting and that we better understand what we need to do to stay on top.</p><div class="quote">“We have focused our business model on the needs of the international and domestic oil companies."</div><h4>How do you assess the importance of Chagala's joint venture with ADM Capital?</h4><p>The joint venture with ADM is an exciting opportunity for Chagala. It allows access to development capital for projects we have already identified and feel strongly about, but would be a challenge funding on our own. The venture allows us to capitalize on these opportunities and to position the company for continued growth. This is an example of how our market reputation and strength has enabled us to employ a variety of financing approaches unlocking the potential in our development pipeline.</p><h4>How do Chagala's different regional operations compare to each other?</h4><p>All of Chagala's operating assets are in the west—Aktau, Bautino, Atyrau, Uralsk, and Aksai. All are designed and built to service the large oil and gas projects located there—CMOC and the N Block project in Aktau, CMOC and Kashagan in Bautino, Tengizchevroil and Kashagan in Atyrau, and Karachaganak in Uralsk and Aksai. Our long history and future in the region positions us to anticipate and meet the rapidly developing needs in these locations. The bottom line is that none of the cities where we have operations today had a well-developed service sector when we first arrived. In many ways we were the trailblazers. Look at Aktau and Atyrau today—they are both very different places. At first there was a need for basic quality housing, and then better food service options, office space, logistics, and others quickly followed. The nature of market demand continues to evolve. We know the market and have a pipeline of development projects to meet what we foresee the market demanding.</p><h4>How do you assess the pressure on giant projects like Karachaganak and Kashagan affecting the investment climate on the services side of the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is currently doing what many resource rich countries are doing; assessing the state's involvement in developing its natural resources. In some cases the authorities are taking steps to bring a more appropriate balance to the relationships. This has not always been an easy process, and in some cases it has caused delays in projects. To a large degree, the project shareholders are reluctant to commit investment dollars to projects until they better understand the investment climate. This is natural and completely understandable. The knock-on effects for service companies should also be easily understood. But again, once that understanding is gained there is no question that projects will push ahead and business levels should improve in concert with that. As for smaller projects, with energy prices likely to remain at current levels for the foreseeable future, more and more smaller companies are looking to expand operations and improve conditions for their staff. Better service in areas such as catering, remote camp management, office space, and access to leisure facilities are all now topics of discussion with companies that could only dream about such issues even five years ago. We see a very bright future for the company in this area.</p><h4>What, in your opinion, are the biggest challenges that Chagala faces in tendering for services contracts in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>According to the laws of the land, we meet the standards to qualify as a local service provider. Around 98% of our employees are Kazakhstani, including some of our most senior management team. We are quite proud of our record on employment and development of local talent. However, we sometimes still find ourselves at a disadvantage in the tendering process because of the inconsistent ways in which the local content laws are interpreted and implemented in various situations. Not only is that a challenge for us, but we think it is unfortunate and unhealthy for Kazakhstan.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Through Hard Graft]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[through-hard-graft]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind the opening of Hospital Metropolitano in 1985?</h4><p>Several Ecuadorean doctors, most of them having studied their sub-specialty in the best clinics and hospitals around the world, realized upon return to Ecuador that there was no hospital infrastructure up to international standards. Therefore, a few of them came together initially, with that dream in mind. They asked American Medical International (AMI) to evaluate the project, based on their experience owning hospitals around the world and it concluded there was potential for a hospital with high-quality standards in Quito. AMI joined the doctors interested in the project as a major shareholder of Conclina C.A., the group that owns Hospital Metropolitano. It is the reference point in the health sector of Ecuador in terms of hospital management, quality patient care, cutting-edge technology, and professionalism of the medical, technical, and administrative staff.</p><h4>In 2001 Hospital Metropolitano began a technological restructuring plan. How would you evaluate the hospital in terms of technological advances?</h4><p>Since the beginning, to differentiate itself with cutting-edge technology and infrastructure was the main goal of the hospital. From a technological perspective, we have attached special importance to the renewal and acquisition of new equipment in order to address highly complex services. Thus, for example, in 2009 the first liver transplant was carried out in the country at Hospital Metropolitano, the only authorized health institution to carry out this procedure. In 2010, we acquired a linear accelerator for radiotherapy. It is cutting-edge technology for cancer treatment. In the same year, we also renewed our laboratory based on an agreement with Roche, giving us the opportunity to use similar equipment to many well-known hospitals in Europe; and in 2011, new 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment was first used to confirm diagnoses more accurately.</p><div class="quote">“The private sector is an important part of the national healthcare system."</div><h4>How successful has your transplant unit been?</h4><p>Hospital Metropolitano has been characterized by the development of its professionals and the incorporation of new complex procedures. One of the most complex procedures is organ transplant. We performed, 60 transplants during 2011, such as like kidney, liver, cornea, and bone marrow transplants. Hospital Metropolitano is the only institution that has obtained accreditation to perform liver transplants in Ecuador from the government through the National Agency for Organ and Tissue Transplants (ONTOT), considered one of the most complex procedures in the world. We have performed 36 hepatic transplants since 2010. Based on our morbidity rate, our success rate is comparable with other hospitals that are capable of performing this complex procedure around the world.</p><h4>How have your relationships with international institutions helped the development of the hospital?</h4><p>In order to keep up the improvement of our quality indicators, Hospital Metropolitano has a large number of agreements with different healthcare institutions around the world with which we share experiences. In our daily goal for excellence, Hospital Metropolitano has managed to obtain several certifications from recognized institutions worldwide, which guarantee the high quality of its processes and maintain its international service standards, which are applied in different areas, motivating the improvement of internal processes and training for our employees. These efforts have allowed Hospital Metropolitano to obtain accreditation from Joint Commission International (JCI), in March 2011. I'm proud to say that our hospital is the only one in Ecuador to have this recognition on excellence in safety and quality in patient care. In addition, we have obtained other certifications for many processes that have satisfied quality and international standards, such as ISO 9001-2000, obtained in 2001; the recertification of ISO 9001-2008, in 2010; accreditation from the American College of Pathology; and special recognition from Great Place to Work in November 2010, among others. Each accreditation confirms the management philosophy and codes of ethics that protect all medical procedures performed in the hospital.</p><h4>How do you assess the quality and role of private healthcare in the country?</h4><p>The private sector is an important part of the national healthcare system. As a part of it, we need to distinguish ourselves in what we offer. Quality, safety, and warmness are essential. The private sector competes in these areas constantly. Hospital Metropolitano has always positioned itself as having the best doctors, a differentiated infrastructure, cutting-edge technology, and quality standards in the attention given to its patients. The whole healthcare system faces the challenge of increasing quality standards despite the rising costs in technology. The population is also growing, and life expectancy is higher than ever. The private sector should play the leading role in terms of quality and safety toward patients, besides collaborating with the government to achieve the universal access to healthcare services, for every Ecuadorean.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Vector evolved since its establishment?</h4><p>Vector is a securities broker-dealer in Mexico. A Monterrey based group of investors led by the entrepreneurship of Alfonso Romo acquired the company in 1987, changing the name to Vector. At the beginning Vector had only an office in Mexico City; then the management established the headquarters in Monterrey. During its first years the company was more oriented to investment banking activities servicing companies in Monterrey. Later, in 1996, the company started a process to develop a nationwide network in Mexico. Now, Vector is the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. By independent, we mean a company that is not part of any banking group, neither foreign nor Mexican. This is our strategy and we have defined that we want to keep it that way. We have developed a large network of branches in Mexico. We now have 21 branches including two in Mexico City and two in Guadalajara.</p><h4>What are your expectations regarding IPOs, and what does this signal about the Mexican market?</h4><p>Before 2009, IPOs were almost marginal. Now there has been a trend to increase that. The Certificate of Capital for Development (CKD) is a structure the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) developed in order for Mexican private pension funds to invest in private equity in the country. Before that, it was not allowed. Private equity is a challenge. In Mexico, private equity represents 0.4% of GDP, which is very small. However, Mexico is in a very interesting position right now. It has an excellent financial situation. Public debt and the trade deficit are especially low. We are in a good position to attract foreign investment and we are seeing many US companies interested. We see an attractive growth potential in the private equity market. Going back to IPOs, the big companies that are listed on the BMV have, in general, low leverage ratios, high operating margins, and are very well capitalized, and so they are in good condition and ready to carry out acquisitions. M&amp;A activity is going to increase and a way to finance acquisition is through the market. The demand is higher than the supply in terms of IPOs. Vector has participated in every IPO that has been done in Mexico for the last seven years. The BMV has 132 domestic companies listed plus 339 foreign companies, as well as 400 exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and in 2011 we saw 10 Mexican companies being listed. We feel we can grow this number.</p><div class="quote">“Before 2009, IPOs were almost marginal. Now there has been a trend to increase that."</div><h4>What are the major strengths and challenges of Mexico's capital markets?</h4><p>One strength Mexico has is the regulation and also the platform and infrastructure the stock market is based on. We have a very good platform, strong and reliable regulation, many brokers, and high demand. On the IPO side, regulation costs are relatively high, but there is also a lack of culture in understanding the advantages of being listed. The challenge is to convince Mexican business people of these benefits. A positive development in the capital markets in Mexico is that investors are more globally oriented, and we can build portfolios with a global vision. We can take advantage of the volatility in the markets and the economic trends and strengths of some countries, for example Chile and Colombia, which are doing very well, or Peru, where there are opportunities to be part of that growth process.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of the brokerage industry and for Mexico's capital markets?</h4><p>The financial sector is very strong. It is continuously evolving in terms of new products, new structures, and new ways to finance and provide equity and debt to companies. The future in Mexico is really optimistic. In the case of institutional investors, we have to provide significantly improved platforms because they are becoming more sophisticated every day. They participate in international markets, they are very active in trading activities, and they are not just passive investors. It is a sector that continues to grow. In terms of individual investors, just 200,000 have an account with a brokerage firm. This is a small number considering that Mexico has a population of 110 million. There are a lot of people who invest in certificates of deposit and fixed-income products. The challenge is to convince them they are losing money that way. They don't want risk. First, we need more companies and more alternatives to invest, and then we have to democratize the access of individual investors and smaller companies to the capital markets. Globalization is also taking place in financial transactions, and we have to take advantage of that. Mexico is on the right path to do that.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has Pichincha Bank specialized in over the years?</h4><p>Pichincha is a universal bank that serves all types of customers. Our microfinance program was established 15 years ago, when we found a very important niche in the market. Pichincha is not only the largest bank in Ecuador, but also the largest lender of micro credits in the country. Almost $1 billion is placed in micro credits to urban and rural areas of the country. Considering that those credits are generally worth an average of $1,500 each, we serve millions of customers with this product. Micro credits have proven to be the best way to develop countries such as Ecuador. Although it is an expensive banking strategy, it's very profitable in the economic and social sense, and these experiences have been fantastic for us.</p><h4>Apart from micro credits, what other products stand out in your portfolio?</h4><p>At Pichincha, the core business is our customer. We mainly focus on people. We engage in corporate banking, but we generally operate through our main target: the employees of corporations. Technology is opening up opportunities to reach customers in a variety of ways. In the past, the only way to attract new customers was to open more branches. However, no amount of branches will cover every Ecuadorean the way technology can. For example, mobile technology is becoming the most practical way to connect a bank with its customers. The internet banking segment is also growing very fast. Pichincha has 2.5 million customers, of which 2.3 million are individuals, and 200,000 are companies. We process 300 million transactions per year, one-third of which are done through ATMs. An additional one-third are completed through the internet. This means that, in total, two-thirds of our transactions are done electronically. The growth we experienced over the past years is a reflection of our ability to offer our customers a chance to bank electronically.</p><div class="quote">“Micro credits have proven to be the best way to develop countries such as Ecuador."</div><h4>What measures will Pichincha Bank implement to comply with the new Control of Market Power law?</h4><p>The law has not been applied yet. Surrounded by political concern, it is difficult for us to say how the law will influence the sector. Regulations that control the market's power are usually good, and this legislation has historically been absent in Ecuador. We hope that the law will effectively restrict monopolies. However, if the law is used as a political weapon, it will become very frustrating. We have created a department that will analyze and emphasize how we can better regulate our activities. Since the banking crisis of the late 1990s, banking controls have been very strict and aggressive; we don't see the new law substantially affecting the way we do business.</p><h4>Does Pichincha have plans to expand internationally?</h4><p>We are requesting a license to operate in Shanghai. So far, we have received the first approvals and we expect to finalize the application process during 2012. We will be the first Ecuadorean banking representative office in Asia. We are also looking toward Bolivia as a potential market in which to implement our micro credit program.</p><h4>What are the plans for becoming the main bank for remittances coming from Europe?</h4><p>We are developing a very important tool to assist remittances. Pichincha is affiliated with the most important remittance companies in the world, and we feel that we are large enough to connect with the beneficiaries of those remittances in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, in addition to Ecuador. We aim to become a very important actor in the process, and we see that there is the potential to double or triple our size in the coming years. We have built alliances with a number of banks such as Banco Popular, La Caixa, and Bankia in Spain, but there are other banks around the world that are leading in this area, and we have signed agreements with many of these important actors.</p><h4>Pichincha also plans to introduce micro credits in Spain. How do you expect the market to react?</h4><p>We are the first Latin American bank to open commercial banking operations in Spain. We are not trying to compete with the big Spanish banks, but the Ecuadorean community in Spain is very important to us; there are almost 1 million Ecuadoreans living in Spain. We focus on this migrant group because we know that they are good customers, no matter where they are. Ecuadoreans all over the world should have access to credit, and we feel that micro credit is a good way to support their businesses. We have seen the benefits in Ecuador, and we expect the same results in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Spain. Pichincha is a commercial bank like any other bank.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the success of Mexico's monetary policy in recent years, and what elements have contributed to the stability we now see in the economy and financial system?</h4><p>Mexico has made great progress in achieving macroeconomic stability in recent years. A monetary policy framework committed to price stability, supported by prudent fiscal policy, relatively low levels of public debt, a flexible exchange rate regime, and a sound financial system have helped to reduce both inflation and its volatility and to anchor inflation expectations. That is, the progress made in terms of inflation in Mexico has been reached in the context of a strong macroeconomic policy framework and, in general, in an environment of solid economic fundamentals. In this setting, Mexico has significantly moved forward in the process of convergence towards the 3% permanent inflation target and it is expected to follow this direction. Furthermore, in order to reinforce the compromise with price stability, the authorities have strengthened the monetary policy framework in recent years. Since the communication strategy is an important element of the monetary policy regime, Banco de México's Board of Governors considered it convenient to expand the communication mechanisms with the public. From 2011 onwards, the minutes of the Board of Governors' meetings with respect to monetary policy decisions have been published. This aims to increase the central institute's transparency even more and thereby offer more information to market participants and the public about the monetary policy decision-making process, highlighting the most important factors in the decisions of the Board of Governors' members. This measure has had a favorable impact on investor sentiment and consequently it has strengthened Banco de México's commitment to price stability. In summary, the increasing credibility of the macroeconomic policy framework and the solid economic fundamentals have significantly improved market participants' confidence in the Mexican economy. These elements have contributed to the stability we currently see in Mexico.</p><h4>What policy measures have been most successful in helping to control the volatility of the peso in the dynamic international foreign exchange market?</h4><p>First, it is important to remember that foreign exchange policy in Mexico is set by a Foreign Exchange Commission, which is integrated by officials from the Ministry of Finance and from Banco de México, and that since December of 1994 we operate with a free floating exchange rate regime, which is an important element of the macroeconomic policy framework in Mexico. It can partially absorb external shocks and consequently attenuate the adverse impact on the domestic economy. In this context, due to its stabilizing properties the floating exchange rate regime has played a key role during the recent period of fluctuation in the international foreign exchange market. In particular, given the confidence in this regime, the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate has allowed a depreciation of the real exchange rate without an effect on inflation or its expectations. Furthermore, in light of the adverse conditions prevailing in international financial markets and with the aim of preserving the orderly functioning of the foreign exchange market, the Foreign Exchange Commission, composed of officials from the Ministry of Finance and Banco de México, decided to implement some preventive measures. First, the Foreign Exchange Commission decided to temporary suspend the monthly auction of put options for $600 million among credit institutions that was put in place in March of 2010 to foster the process of the accumulation of international reserves. Second, on November 30, 2011 Banco de México started carrying out daily auctions for a total amount of $400 million among credit institutions with a minimum price of 2% above the immediate previous working day's exchange rate. This mechanism was successfully used in the past to provide liquidity to the foreign exchange market with minimum market distortions. At this point, it is worthwhile to remember that a very important characteristic of all the mechanisms to sell and buy dollars that the Mexican authorities have put in place is that at all times they have never targeted any specific level for the exchange rate. The consistency in terms of the free-floating regime by limiting the interventions in the market to rule-based mechanisms has helped to control volatility over the long run. In fact, this consistency has helped develop a very liquid peso-dollar market, which according to the last triennial survey conducted by the BIS in 2010 places the Mexican peso as the second most liquid emerging market currency, just below the Korean won. In addition, a tool that has also helped contain volatility has been the communication policy that the authorities have maintained with the market. In that respect, the Foreign Exchange Commission has made a very important effort to be as transparent as possible in terms its policy actions. Furthermore, Mexico has a sound macroeconomic framework and solid economic fundamentals, which in the end has determined the performance of the Mexican peso in the long run.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico has made great progress in achieving macroeconomic stability in recent years."</div><h4>Mexico is seeing a steady increase in capital flows. In your opinion, what makes foreign investors confident in directing investments to the country?</h4><p>Since the second half of 2009, the Mexican economy has received important flows of external financial resources. The stock of government bonds held by non-residents increased from Ps260 billion ($19.7 billion) in June 2009 to Ps973 billion ($69.8 billion) at the end of 2011. The pattern of foreign investment flows is explained by structural factors, such as the solid economic fundamentals of the Mexican economy. Another factor is the inclusion of Mexican government long-term bonds into the World Government Bond Index (WGBI) in November 2010. The incorporation of Mexico's government bonds into the WGBI increased these bonds' holdings by non-residents due to the fact that, among other reasons, a considerable number of investment funds worldwide use this index as a reference for their investment portfolio formation. There are other elements related to recent developments that also have supported these flows of foreign financial resources. First, the extraordinary quantitative easing in the US has implied elevated interest rate spreads between Mexico and the US, which led to substantial foreign capital inflows, mainly channeled to government security purchases. Second, in 2009 and 2010, the improvement in the financial systems of the main advanced economies led to increased levels of liquidity in the international financial markets. It is important to mention again that in September 2011 the increasing uncertainty in financial markets as a result of economic and financial problems in the euro zone produced a temporary reversal of investment flows to the Mexican economy. This situation was short lived and in November and December 2011 the Mexican economy once again received positive flows of external financial resources. These recent events contrast with those at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, when a widespread sale of medium- and long-term government securities led to a significant decrease in non-residents' financial savings. Since then, the strengthening of the fundamentals of the Mexican economy has contributed to the expansion of investors in the base that participates in the Mexican bond market. In particular, the number of institutional investors with a longer-term profile has increased. Regarding FDI flows, which are a relevant source of long-term funding for the economy, they have been flowing to Mexico over recent years, despite lower levels of global economic activity. In 2010, FDI amounted to $19.8 billion, up from $15.8 billion the previous year. The trade openness of our economy, the resumption of economic growth in Mexico, and a stable domestic macroeconomic environment have been factors that have supported these flows of FDI.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Carlsberg's business evolved in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our company entered the Kazakhstani market in 1998 under the Ak-Nar label. The same year the new brand, Irbis, was introduced to the market. In 1999 the DERBES brand was developed. Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH), an international brewery owned by Carlsberg and the British brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle, acquired a stake in Ak-Nar Brewery, and merged the two businesses, including Irbis and Ak-Nar in 2003. Ak-Nar was renamed DERBES in December 2006. Carlsberg Group later acquired Scottish &amp; Newcastle shares and became the beneficial owner of BBH assets in Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic states. As a result, DERBES joined the Carlsberg Group in April 2008. DERBES was officially renamed to Carlsberg Kazakhstan in December 2010. Under Carlsberg, DERBES has enjoyed many of the opportunities offered by the Group—we have had the chance to apply the best practices employed by Carlsberg globally, and significant investments were made to modernize our site and develop our personnel. We conducted research that demonstrated that renaming would be able to offer additional, mostly intangible, benefits. We are now associated with the fourth largest brewer in the world, which is well known for its high-quality brands and great achievements. Needless to say, our image as an employer has improved significantly and we are planning to further utilize our potential as part of a large international group. In general Carlsberg Group operations are based on a “glocal" approach by finding the right balance between working closely together on a global level and actively developing local brands and initiatives. Carlsberg Kazakhstan operations cover the Kazakhstani market only and is a part of Carlsberg Group's Eastern Europe region that also includes brewing companies in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan.</p><h4>How does beer fit in to Kazakhstani society?</h4><p>Unfortunately, there is no legal differentiation between alcoholic beverages in Kazakhstan. The legislation puts vodka and beer in the same category. Beer is a naturally fermented low-alcohol-content drink , whereas vodka is a much stronger distilled beverage. The main problem with the government's strict approach is that it limits our advertising and distribution. We are subject to the same regulations as vodka, whiskey, or tequila, and this has to change. You can't put wine and whiskey in the same category. Consumers have different needs, habits, and usage for these products. In Kazakhstan beer is three times more expensive than vodka, in pure spirit terms, because of excessive regulation that significantly increases the cost of beer production and distribution. For example, the sale of alcohol in PET bottles has been banned in Kazakhstan for many years, and we cannot use this affordable and completely safe type of packaging in beer production. Because of such regulation and low beer affordability consumers tend to choose cheaper, stronger spirits over expensive beer; as a result, overall alcohol consumption increases.</p><div class="quote">“The consumer is now able to experience different tastes, and this is feeding Carlsberg's growth."</div><h4>Which segments of the market do your products address?</h4><p>In different countries there are different trends. In Kazakhstan, people tend to buy lager—light, easy-drinkable beer. Consumers also like the flavor of non-filtered beer. There is a comparatively new segment in Kazakhstan market that has recently gained immense popularity; the sale of draught beer in off-trade outlets. There are two kinds of consumers who prefer this segment: those who believe that such beer is fresher and has a different taste, and those who seek an affordable option. One of the problems in the country is that there aren't many glass bottle producers. We have just one glass bottle producer, but its supply is limited and the price is high. Therefore, we purchase glass bottles from Russia to mitigate our costs. The same can be said about aluminum cans—there is no single producer in Kazakhstan. As a result, cans and bottles have to be imported, and transport costs are quite high, which makes beer even less affordable. This is another reason for the growth of such segments as draught in off-trade.</p><h4>What are Carlsberg Kazakhstan's main marketing tools?</h4><p>Alcohol advertising is not allowed in Kazakhstan; however, we are allowed to advertise non-alcoholic beer. For that we use traditional channels—mostly TV and outdoor advertising. At the same time more focus is placed on point-of-sale advertising in both on-trade and the hotel/restaurant/café (Horeca) channel, which is becoming more popular as well. We want to illustrate the uniqueness of our product, and try to introduce something new to the market. Local consumers are perceptive mostly to product appearance. Innovation and regular changes in positioning are also important, and so first we have to attract the consumer. Another important aspect is the taste. As everyone has different tastes, we have to have enough variety to provide exactly what the consumer needs. Kazakhstani consumers prefer classic lager, while dark beer such as porter or ale is not popular here. This is different from Europe where different sorts of beer are consumed with various foods; we haven't arrived at that point in the Kazakhstani market. Here, the beer-food association is not that obvious, but hopefully we can expand such marketing tools in the future.</p><h4>How would you assess Carlsberg's position vis-í -vis other brands in the market?</h4><p>The consumer is now able to experience different tastes, and this is feeding Carlsberg's growth. Customers want to try new things. We are not at Europe's level, but we do have a wide base of customers. There are local and international varieties available. Beer is a social drink, and it can be a part of a good meal and friendly atmosphere.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the third-largest exporter of glass in the world, what is behind the Åžişecam success story?</h4><p>The driving force of the Åžişecam Group's powerful export potential lies in its historical 75 years of development and the macroeconomic policies Turkey adopted after 1980. Åžişecam began its operations with the Paşabahçe plant, which manufactured glassware. The company has since grown strongly through the diversification of its product range, technological advancements, rapid capacity increases, a corporate R&amp;D function, and by opening up to global markets. Our strategic focus includes investments and alliances outside Turkey, and Åžişecam now looks toward the global market. With its strategic focus Åžişecam has been well prepared for the challenges of competing at an international level. The group was well positioned with respect to the EU Customs Union, even before it was implemented. Åžişecam exports over 60% of its products to European economies. Additionally, the company is now a member of European organizations including the European Glass Manufacturers Association (EGM), the Federation of European Glass Container Manufacturers (FEVE), the European Glass Household Wares Committee (EDG), the Permanent Glass Industry Committee of European Union (CPIV), and the European Glass Fiber Producers Association (APFE). Åžişecam adopted the principle of manufacturing glass to economies of scale, with top international service and product quality standards.</p><h4>To what extent will glass exports help to reduce the current account deficit (CAD) in the country?</h4><p>There are many aspects related to the solution of the CAD problem and the improvement of the country's foreign trade deficit is one of them. The glass industry offers an advantageous framework. First, the sector's glass export volume is higher than imports, generating a positive foreign trade balance. Aside from that, glass manufacturing intensively uses local inputs, excluding energy and machinery. Consequently, the major part of the value-added by the glass industry can be attributed to domestic input factors. In this respect, glass exports will contribute positively to the national economy in the future.</p><div class="quote">“Currently, Åžişecam allocates 1% of its aggregate turnover to R&amp;D activities consistently."</div><h4>How do you evaluate incentives for the private sector to invest in R&amp;D?</h4><p>R&amp;D is one of the factors vital for emerging economies. Turkey would achieve limited gains if the products manufactured have low value-added. The government aims to improve the national technology and R&amp;D base through various initiatives. At present, a series of practices are in place, such as the partial public funding of R&amp;D in the form of social security premiums and the taxation of employees at lower scales. This is part of the state's policy to make R&amp;D investments a driving factor for the economy, and to increase value-added and employment opportunities. Moreover, the private sector must improve its efforts in R&amp;D activities as well. We believe that public-supported R&amp;D spending and incentive policies can create synergy as long as private enterprises have plans to innovate as part of the strategic agenda. In fact, Åžişecam considers its R&amp;D initiatives a significant basis of its claim to global participation.</p><h4>What portion of Åžişecam's budget is allocated to R&amp;D activities?</h4><p>Currently, Åžişecam allocates 1% of its aggregate turnover to R&amp;D activities consistently. R&amp;D has always played an important role in improving our skills and technology in the field of glass and chemicals. Due to the characteristics of the glass industry, Åžişecam focuses on furnace, glass batch, and glass formation technology. Our priorities are on product development in line with emerging customer demand for high-technology products.</p><h4>Which sectors within the glass industry have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Flat glass and its derivatives have a significant potential for growth. There is a higher demand for flat glass both in our country and in other emerging markets throughout the world. Increasing global attention on energy efficiency and sustainable environmental conditions has made the thermal insulation of buildings an important factor. Now, flat glass has become an important construction item that enhances the level of comfort with a number of functions. The automotive sector is a source of increasing demand, qualitatively and quantitatively. Diversified designs and innovations have gradually increased the production of value-added household glassware. Health and urban life boost the role of glass packaging. A larger consumer base now demands light and robust glass packaging products. Glass fiber has a wide application potential in sectors such as energy, automotive, and infrastructure. There is also a substantial potential in renewable solar energy and flat display monitors, in addition to other new applications worldwide.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for value-added export products in Turkey's glass industry?</h4><p>Our major priorities in flat glass are based on energy efficiency with a focus on environmental sustainability. This generates potential in construction glass products. The Turkish glass industry has also developed products for the automotive and electrical house appliance sectors. The tableware sector will continue to export worldwide and add new products with outstanding design to the market. Emerging countries are making considerable infrastructure investments, which will create new opportunities in the glass-fiber segment.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Roche's presence in the Middle East, and the significance of Dubai in terms of operations in the region?</h4><p>We have been active in the Middle East for many years. Via our partners and distributors, we take care of distribution, customer support, and logistics across the region. The organization that supports these distributors across the world is located in Mannheim, and the marketing support, service support, trainers, and applications are directed from Mannheim. The extremely good experience we have had with the development of our business in the Middle East region led us in 2011 to change the setup of how we distribute our products here, and how we can become a company that is closer to its distribution partners and customers in the region. We have therefore decided to open an office and management center in Dubai. This center will take over marketing responsibilities, service, support, training, logistics, and quality management, as well as all other necessary activities to be closer to our customers in the region. This allows us to develop solutions for our clients in a much more customized way than is possible when far away, especially when things in this region are dependent on very specific conditions such as the weather, like the logistics process.</p><h4>Why did you decide that now is the right time to open up in Dubai?</h4><p>We decided it at this time because after a long period, during which we were very fortunate to experience double-digit growth year after year, we felt that in order to be able to continue at the same pace we needed to be closer to our clients. Customers want to see that you are easily reachable. In 2011 we decided that it was the right time, and we began to build up our management center for the whole Middle East region. Now, we're ready to go.</p><div class="quote">“Our first goal is to get our presence known and strengthen our commitment to investing in the region."</div><h4>How large will your new base in Jebel Ali be?</h4><p>By 2013 we will have approximately 50 people working in different areas: marketing, marketing support, quality management, safety, training, technical services, IT, and finance. We believe that this is just the beginning because the potential here is great, and customers expect their suppliers to offer them the latest products. There is no compromise here on quality. There are no differences between what we offer in the Middle East and what we offer in the US, Japan, and Western Europe. Customers want to build their own solutions now. The customer indicates his improvement needs and we discuss together the specifications of the new clinical laboratory, and we build it, first as a concept, then in reality. We call it “Dreamlab." In Abu Dhabi we are currently building one of the largest highly automated laboratories in the whole region. It is a laboratory that can be showcased globally, and will be top of the line.</p><h4>What is your product development plan?</h4><p>Our first goal is to get our presence known and strengthen our commitment to investing in the region. Our second goal is to promote our new products. Dreamlab covers all the needs of a central laboratory of a hospital, or a reference laboratory. We are also launching new products that are important in the area of oncology. We offer these products to oncology centers across the region. For the first time we also offer fully automatic histopathology through our primary pathology system called “Symphony," which allows a user, in a fully-automated way, to handle a large portion of the workload in a pathology lab. This is a very important part in the diagnosis process for cancer patients. Another area is molecular diagnostics and applied science in the area of sequencing, which is a very important area today. Furthermore, in this area there are projects for genomics, genomic sequencing, and life science research ongoing in Saudi Arabia and throughout the whole region.</p><h4>What have been the trends and demands for products in the UAE?</h4><p>The strongest demand is for fully automatic central clinical laboratories. What many are looking for are platforms that cover the broadest possible parameter spectrum, in order to consolidate the workload of many different instruments into one central laboratory. We are very pleased with the outcome. We also see that the medical and healthcare systems in hospitals are becoming increasingly interested in adopting point-of-care solutions to be closer to their patients. This should be connected with the central laboratory information system in order to handle the urgent diagnostic needs of wards.</p><h4>Is personalized health care (PHC) a key strategy for you?</h4><p>PHC is a key differentiator for Roche, as a pioneer over the last 10 years in developing this important new field of patient diagnosis and treatment. In 2011 we were extremely successful in launching a new personalized drug therapy called Zelboraf to treat patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Zelboraf was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an accelerated process because of the clear benefits for patients. Clinical studies showed that Zelboraf was unique in slowing down the growth of cancer and even helping patients carrying a BRAF-V600-Mutation live longer. At the same time we also launched the companion diagnostics called cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, which helps the oncologist to select the patients that will benefit from the therapy. This is important for the doctors, as they want to know how to best treat patients through access to state-of-the-art diagnostic procedures, as well as for the patient who expects the right treatment. As the drug is difficult to develop and produce, we all want it to be provided to patients who will really benefit, so the healthcare system is also more effective with the limited resources it has.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some defining elements of Kaspi Bank's strategy under your leadership?</h4><p>We have very simple vision; “to be the best retail bank in the country," and therefore our focus is primarily servicing mass-market retail customers. Our general idea is to provide the right customer with the right product through the right channel at the right time. We are developing 360 degrees around the customer, which means we are building our business around customers and integrating customer acquisition, sales, and service channels to provide the best quality service. The speed of service and sales has been an important competitive advantage, which we have been constantly building. Over the past three years, we have developed innovative products. We have introduced the first mass-market credit card in 2008. To date, we have issued more than 1 million credit cards, which put us in the number one position in Kazakhstan, and 6th or 7th in the CIS region. We have also been introducing products such as the cash loan, which is a simple product to satisfy the various needs of our customers. Every second a retail loan in Kazakhstan is issued by Kaspi Bank. More than 2 million people used our services in 2011 to obtain loans, make deposits, use credit cards, perform payments, and carry out money transfers. Our company has been heavily focused on distribution and has built one branch every three days over the past year. As a result, we have established more than 650 outlets, branches, and points of sale, which is not only the largest distribution in the banking sector, but the largest retail network in any sector in the country. We have been investing into direct marketing, and we make 2 million calls every month to our customers, more than all the mobile operators combined together. We are the only bank open until late hours and on the weekend. Currently, we are introducing a new sales channel—kaspi.kz, which is our unique internet outlet. Our internet outlet will enable our customers to use our services for free and it will provide our clients with amazing functionality, like an internet retailer, rather than traditional internet banking. kaspi.kz will reinforce our 360 degree strategy by adding internet as an important client acquisition, sales, and service channel. We have been one of the leaders in terms of deposit growth and as a result, the loan-deposit ratio is approximately 100%.</p><h4>What trends have you observed with your credit card users' consumption behavior?</h4><p>At the moment, we are at the stage where people are starting to realize the revolving capacity of a credit card. Since Kaspi Bank is the largest card issuer, we are taking on the responsibility of educating our customers. We invest a lot to build customer awareness around all the qualities and benefits of a credit card. Considering our significant market position in this business, we are educating the market also for benefit of other banks planning to enter.</p><div class="quote">“There are important lessons learned from the crisis, such as the fact that banks should not lend to the extent they did before."</div><h4>The IMF noted that the ongoing weaknesses in Kazakhstan's banking system are a cause for concern. How would you assess the IMF's statement?</h4><p>The IMF report needs to be taken into account, and the government has been working on addressing the concerns of the IMF, such as the writing off of non-performing loans (NPLs). Compared to other banks in the region, Kazakhstani banks seem to have more provisions and NPLs on their balance sheets. The reason is because our banks cannot write them off or sell them to collection companies, and this is due to tax regulations. We always have to explain to investors that if we could write off loans, our numbers would not look like this. The government is making this issue a priority, and so hopefully we will come to a resolution in 2012. It is not a matter of collecting more taxes, but of having a competitive, operational, and sound banking system. There is no example of a strong economy with a weak banking sector, and unless the bad loan situation is resolved the development of Kazakhstan's banking sector will be significantly limited.</p><h4>How do you assess the structural changes in Kazakhstan's financial regulatory system in 2011?</h4><p>There are always pros and cons. The most common disadvantage comes from combining monetary policy with supervision policy. There is a conflict of interest between those two roles. On the other hand, many believe that during difficult times it makes sense to consolidate. However, what is most important is leadership and I do believe that National Bank of Kazakhstan has some of the most professional leadership among all the region's central banks. At the end of the day, this is what matters the most.</p><h4>What are your expectations from the new banking law?</h4><p>The new banking law combines many policies into one legislative package. There are important lessons learned from the crisis, such as the fact that banks should not lend to the extent they did before and should not be investing outside of Kazakhstan to such a large extent. Moreover, our banks will not be permitted to carry many speculative financial instruments on their balance sheet, as they were doing before. Today, we enjoy a much more transparent system that functions as a manual for the banks as lenders. Banks should refrain from participating in activities such as hedge funds or real estate funds. This is simply too risky. These are the factors that led to the demise of many banks worldwide and in Kazakhstan. The legislation creates limitations on international expansion, and now banks cannot invest more than a certain percentage of capital outside of the country, which may be temporary. I still believe that Kazakhstan needs to expand its business into bigger markets. This will be good both for business and country. If we decide to work outside of Kazakhstan, we would like to invest more than the specified 10% of our capital. All drawbacks aside, the laws bring personal responsibility to the management and the shareholders.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The support programs of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) support programs include investment development, risk prevention, knowledge transfer, sustainability, and the direct farming support program Procampo. Which of these has been the most successful in improving local agriculture?</h4><p>I think that the policies that Mexico implements are aligned with international trade regulations. At a global level, the WTO regulates the amount of subsidies that a government channels to the agriculture sector, as well as the type of subsidies. Not all varieties of subsidies are allowed. For example, export restrictions are not permitted, and export subsidies are also prohibited. Mexico upholds these commitments. Procampo is a subsidy for farmers that is expensive, but generalized. The WTO considers Procampo a “green" subsidy, because we do not distort the market or force farmers to produce a particular product. Under Procampo, farmers have absolute freedom to produce whatever they wish. We do not encourage production by giving production subsidies. In 2011, we began a rural extension program that links universities and research centers to farmers in order to better understand how 21st century agriculture should be practiced. Students receive technical knowledge, as well as training in economics and environmental protection. We also have programs for migrants residing in the US who send remittances to their families in Mexico's rural areas. We encourage them to use these remittances to improve productivity, and thereby create jobs.</p><h4>How important is SAGARPA's geographical range in terms of exports?</h4><p>Our range is very important because Mexico has historically depended on the US, in both imports and exports, and now we are seeking more dynamic markets, such as China, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. A number of countries in Latin American and the Middle East are also potential markets for Mexico. Japan is a country that imports billions of dollars worth of food every year. Mexico and Japan have signed free trade agreement (FTA), and thus we have preferential access to the Japanese market. Mexican products such as avocado, pork, and beef have been very successful in Japan. We have a large number of FTAs with several countries, and this definitely helps our export diversification.</p><h4>In your opinion, what role could biotechnological applications play in the agricultural sector and what degree of penetration do these applications currently have?</h4><p>We have been making progress in the application of genetically modified cotton, soybean, and canola. We are about to begin planting genetically modified corn in some regions, especially in the northern irrigated areas where there are opportunities to strictly control crops. Mexico needs to increase its production, and to do so we have to incorporate new technology. In terms of biotechnology, we have developed various fertilizers for crops and medications for livestock. This branch of science is developing very fast, and it affects two aspects of the production chain, whether organic products or genetically modified inputs.</p><div class="quote">“We have a large number of FTAs with several countries, and this definitely helps our export diversification."</div><h4>How is SAGARPA creating financial schemes that will increase the level of investment in the agricultural sector?</h4><p>Mexico has a sui generis system of land ownership. There are private landowners, and ejidos, or cooperatives. SAGARPA has guarantee funds from the National Guarantee Fund for Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Rural Areas (FONAGA) that support banks in financing small producers. We also offer the banks a guarantee credit for primeras pérdidas, or first losses. SAGARPA also provides insurance schemes and programs that provide a subsidy for the acquisition of certain assets that improve the productivity of a farmer or rancher.</p><h4>What role does Central America play in Mexican exports, and what strategy has SAGARPA implemented to increase exports to this region?</h4><p>Central America is a very interesting market, as it requires inputs or raw materials to develop and process its primary products such as fruits, coffee, rubber, and vegetables. Mexico is able to provide the markets of Central America with machinery and manufacturing tools. We also export cheese, yoghurt, and bread, and other retail goods. Mexican retailers are beginning to enter Central America, such as OXXO and 7-Eleven México. Central America is also becoming very attractive for global companies, such as Nestlé, which is establishing large factories in Mexico in order to export products to Central America. On November 22, 2011 we signed a new FTA with five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) that will boost Mexican exports to the region.</p><h4>In what way is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) benefitting agricultural activities in Mexico?</h4><p>NAFTA assists in two different ways. Such as with the case of Central America, it allows us to import machinery, equipment, and supplies practically without any tax expenses and at a lower cost. Also, it allows us to access the markets of the US and Canada with perishable products, for the most part, that North America has gradually stopped producing. For example, the US has abandoned the production of avocados, citrus fruit, and tomatoes because it is easier to find a less expensive source in Mexico that can produce year round. Therefore, the integration grows deeper day by day. There is also the fact that in Mexico, as well as in the US, we have a huge market that we call the “nostalgia market." For example, there are those Mexicans who have emigrated but maintain their eating habits and look forward to enjoying Mexican cuisine. They have excellent purchasing power, and can have a huge influence on their home communities. These are the sort of consumers who have also been extending their consumption habits to other communities in the US. For example, Tex-Mex cuisine is now found in all parts of the US, and this is creating opportunities that our producers are capturing. I have been in large supermarket chains, such as Fiesta Mart in the US, where perhaps 30% or 40% of the products are manufactured in Mexico or have labels in Spanish. It is like walking into a Mexican grocery store and realizing the power of nostalgia that drives consumers to demand our products.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dubai Health Authority was established in 2007. What was the vision behind the establishment of the authority at that stage?</h4><p>In 2007, the ruler of Dubai decided to create the Dubai Health Authority. His vision was that the healthcare sector was growing, and that there was a need for a regulatory body to lay down a strategy for the whole of Dubai, not only for public hospitals. We had to establish the Dubai strategic healthcare plan, and we had to establish a partnership with the private sector through our regulatory arm. We also had to prepare a funding model that would be suitable for Dubai. We needed a plan regarding regulation, funding, strategy, service provisioning, expanding services, and partnerships, and we needed to focus on educating the new generation. Prior to this, the Department of Health and Medical Services (DOHMS), which was created in 1973, was the functioning authority that almost exclusively focused on health service delivery. Therefore, the DHA was created, in June 2007, by Law 13, with an expanded vision to include strategic oversight for the complete health sector in Dubai and enhance private sector engagement.</p><h4>How would you say the healthcare market has evolved in Dubai over the past few years?</h4><p>The UAE, and Dubai especially, is striving to reach higher standards in security, in health, in education, and in business. The expectations of people moving here to live, work, or just visit are high, and we have to make sure that our health services meet those expectations. In 2007 we began a lot of projects, and we are still planning many projects. We have realized that we need private partnerships. It is not only with money that you can develop hospitals; you also need knowledge and experience. We are expecting two new hospitals to open in Dubai in 2012. In the beginning of 2001 there were less than seven private hospitals, and today we are talking about a total of 20 new hospitals. Clinic numbers are rising and professionals are moving to Dubai. We have an excellent talent pool of healthcare professionals in Dubai. The people of Dubai deserve the best quality and this is an aim we are realizing through our regulatory arm to make sure the industry is regulated to benefit the people. We have very good communications with the private sector and consult with it directly regarding new regulations. We need to give the people of Dubai the ability to choose and compare services. We also want to create a new market for insurance companies. Health care is a huge business when it comes to insurance. I believe that health care has tremendously evolved over the years, and given all the existing parameters and our future plans I see more progress in the years to come.</p><div class="quote">“The UAE, and Dubai especially, is striving to reach higher standards in security, in health, in education, and in business."</div><h4>What projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>One major project involves electronic medical records (EMR). This project will digitize all medical records, and any doctor will be able to see a patient's medical history via computer. We will be able to control our medical stocks, facilitate a paperless environment, and provide patients and healthcare practitioners with complete online access to medical records. You will be able to walk into a clinic, input your information into the system, and your complete medical history will be displayed—this will be applicable even when you travel abroad. In terms of other projects, we are very happy with the progress on the Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, which is the first specialized pediatric hospital in the country. It is a fully dedicated, unique facility for children below the age of 16. In addition to focusing on such specialized projects, we will continue to pay attention to primary health care. We believe that primary health care is our frontline. We have an annual plan to add one health center each year to our existing network of 14 primary health centers spread across the various geographical areas of the Emirate. These are just a number of the things we have in the pipeline.</p><h4>What would you say are the key investment opportunities for partners looking to come to Dubai?</h4><p>There are a lot of opportunities in Dubai in healthcare investment. The challenges that investors sometimes face with regards to ownership or regulation have been resolved here. We work closely with Dubai Healthcare City to assist investors. We are also working with Dubiotech, which is a lucrative project regarding pharmaceutical company research. The pharmaceutical industry is really promising, and it is a big business. With the infrastructure and services that Dubai has in hand, we need to work with it to see what challenges need to be faced, because we believe that Dubai is the best place to be a hub for the distribution of medicine in the region. To achieve this we have to work very hard to make sure that we are enacting the right regulations for the registration of drugs, and other similar issues. When it comes to clinics we are very happy that we have amongst us top professionals from Europe, the US, and also this region. They are happy with the environment here both professionally and personally. Access to Dubai allows people to fly in on a daily basis to do business and then fly back. For a lot of people in the region, the best point for them to meet is Dubai.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the healthcare industry in 2012?</h4><p>In 2012 our focus will be on primary health care. The plan is to make sure that we improve the quality and support our people and family physicians in the primary healthcare sector. If we can reach people in the early stages and take care of them, then that is the best thing to do. We have to go and reach people before the problems start. We have to look at our young children and make sure that they are protected and not wait until they get sick. We are going to help them focus on their lifestyle, and we are going to be lobbying for new regulations to protect students, especially the youth, from unhealthy food habits. We are working with the Dubai Municipality, which is doing a great job, to make a healthy lifestyle more accessible. This is very important. Our focus is on the frontline, on primary health care. In addition to primary healthcare, in 2012, we are also going to focus more on outpatient services.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key reforms the Ministry has implemented since it was established in 2005?</h4><p>The Ministry of Emergency Situations was established on December 16, 2005 to prevent and reduce the consequences of natural and man-made disasters, and forest fires; centralize rescue and rehabilitation management; and organize and implement a civil defense network for the country. We also aim to increase awareness of natural and technogenic disasters, eliminate their consequences, and strengthen the systematic approach to crisis management at the state level. Changes to the Ministry's structure and regulatory framework have been continuously carried out; a material-technical basis and material resources have been established, information about emergency situations has been disseminated among different agencies, and activities concerning the elimination of consequences have been coordinated. Over the past few years, we have purchased and upgraded our material and equipment. We have invested in special-purpose emergency vehicles, training equipment, and specialized clothing and uniforms for the State Fire Protection Service and Special Risk Rescue Service. We have also acquired a variety of specialized vehicles such as water boats, scooters, planes, and helicopters for the State Water Rescue Service and the Aviation Group. Furthermore, we have purchased specialized medical and rescue equipment for the Medical Service. Thus, thanks to the special care of the management of the country, the Ministry has become a fully and technologically equipped mobile entity capable of fulfilling all of its duties. Meanwhile, the Ministry has established its own training academy in order to train personnel and conduct scientific research in the field of emergency situations. Over the last decade, the personnel of the Ministry have successfully taken part in rescue operations such as large-scale firefighting, structural collapses, explosions, accidents, landslides, mudflows and floods, and other natural and man-made disasters.</p><h4>What are some of the major policies the Ministry has implemented to lower the level of road fatalities and work-related accidents?</h4><p>We established and equipped rescue groups in 12 regions able to respond immediately to emergency situations. They conducted numerous rescue operations in response to transportation accidents in 2011. Hundreds of injured people were rescued from damaged vehicles and brought to medical care facilities. We have also analyzed current road, rail, bridge, and intersection technical data in order to install effective security devices. Every year, the Ministry's specialists supervise and conduct technical examinations on more than 100,000 installations and equipment in the oil and gas industry and fuel and natural gas facilities. We are also aiming to protect the environment by monitoring the mining, metallurgy, chemicals, petrochemicals, and oil and gas processing sectors, as well as the transportation of dangerous goods by rail, road, and pipeline. Additionally, we control workers' safety in order to prevent accidents and eliminate potential risks. Moreover, thousands of workers and engineering technical staff are focused on studying safety regulations every year. We aim to raise awareness of civil defense and the rules of conduct during any emergency situation, and we hold regular public awareness events in various educational institutions, establishments, and organizations. Information on accidents and rules of behavior during disasters can be found on the Ministry's website and newspaper.</p><div class="quote">“We have taken the necessary steps to eliminate future risks and improve security measures."</div><h4>Since the floods that affected Azerbaijan in the spring and summer of 2010, how has the Ministry worked to strengthen riverbanks and improve the natural disaster response system?</h4><p>Thousands of workers, helicopters and rescue boats, and a large quantity of equipment were used in the Ministry's active rescue operation during the heavy rainfall and flooding in 2010. The level of groundwater rapidly rose in coastal areas, and the Kura and Aras rivers overflowed their banks. We brought this natural disaster under control, thanks to our constant awareness of the events and the urgent measures taken. Most importantly, we were able to prevent the loss of human life. The people evacuated from the disaster area were relocated to temporary shelters and camps, and the necessary infrastructure was established for the convenience of the temporary settled population. We were able to meet all their needs, especially in terms of health and safety, through the medical offices we set up in the camps. We investigated the causes of the flood, and we have undertaken reconstruction projects by strengthening damaged dams and repairing more than 300 kilometers of the Kura River system. We have taken the necessary steps to eliminate future risks and improve security measures in areas along waterways, such as conducting comprehensive research and investigations with specialists from Dutch companies. The volume of the Kura and Araz rivers was determined by models and the water consumption for both rivers was calculated. Taking into account this calculation and in the result of the temporary working regime of the Mingachevir water reservoir, we were able to avoid the floods in 2011 despite the same volume of water flowing compared to 2010. Under the Ministry, we established the State Agency for Water Resources to improve the management of water resources in the country.</p><h4>How important is international cooperation in improving employee skills in the field of emergency services?</h4><p>Since the Ministry of Emergency Situations was founded, the development of international cooperation has been one of its highest priorities. Therefore, over the last few years we have developed cooperative ties with relevant bodies in the US, Russia, France, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, Korea, Bulgaria, Romania, the UK, Israel, Kazakhstan, Germany, Qatar, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Georgia . The Ministry has also achieved sustainable relations with the UN, OSCE, the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development (GUAM), the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) organization, the International Civil Defense Organization (ICDO), the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as with other international and regional organizations. In addition, the Ministry's rescue workers have participated in the training sessions of many international organizations in the past few years, such as NATO.</p><h4>How would you assess the role of Azerbaijan as a regional contributor to rescue and humanitarian operations abroad?</h4><p>One of the President of Azerbaijan's main characteristics is his goodwill in terms of assisting other countries that face emergency situations. In accordance with the task of the President, the Ministry has taken an active part in several international rescue operations, delivering humanitarian cargo and sending aid. Azerbaijani rescue personnel have participated in efforts to help people affected by floods in Pakistan and earthquakes in Iran and Turkey. For example, 213 rescuers from the Ministry were sent immediately to the earthquake zone in the Turkish province of Van. In 2010, our rescuers took part in the prevention of two large-scale natural disasters in foreign countries. The Aviation Group dispatched two helicopters with 19 rescue workers to help extinguish large-scale forest fires in Russia. Two helicopters with 16 technical personnel were also involved in putting out fires around the city of Haifa in Israel. The relevant services of several countries have praised the Ministry's material-technical base, high-level skills, the professionalism of its personnel, the effective methods and tools it uses for prevention, its management of emergency situations, and elimination of possible side effects. Currently, our rescuers, supplied with modern aviation and fire-fighting equipment, mobile hospitals, and other necessary technical agencies, are ready to take an active part in rescue operations abroad at any time.</p><h4>What are the core priorities for the Ministry during the next few years?</h4><p>Our high-priority duties include the completion of the structural formation of the Ministry, the improvement of our regional centers' activity, the development of quality content and services in all of our organizations, the refinement of our legal framework, and the enhancement of international cooperation.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-intentions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investment opportunities did Nobel Pharma detect in Kazakhstan when it launched its production facilities?</h4><p>When we were considering making the investment, we saw that the Kazakhstani pharmaceutical market had significant growth potential. The lack of domestic manufacturers producing high-quality products through high-technology processes, as well as positive government policies in relation to domestic manufacturing, encouraged us to invest locally. We are proud that in this period we have managed to create the most state-of-the-art pharmaceutical facility in Central Asia. The pharmaceutical products produced in Kazakhstan are now being exported to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. In a short period of time we have achieved our objectives, and have been convinced that our investment decision was the right one.</p><h4>How do you train your staff and ensure the production of high-quality pharmaceuticals?</h4><p>Our factory was founded using high-tech solutions, and was certified through ISO 9001-2008. Recently we have justified our endeavors with our first Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate attained in Kazakhstan. This ensures continuous quality control. We are working in constant liaison with the Ministry of Health and are monitoring innovations in our sector. In order to implement innovations and increase performance, periodical training programs are conducted for our technical and sales department employees. We organize these training sessions with the assistance of specialists from Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. These training programs make our teams, composed of medical doctors and pharmacists, more dynamic and efficient. The implementation of training programs constitutes a major investment in human resources. An investment in human resources is an investment in the future.</p><div class="quote">“The state lends extensive support to domestic manufacturers for the development of the pharmaceutical sector."</div><h4>What are Nobel Pharma's expectations from the newly created common economic space with Russia and Belarus?</h4><p>We are monitoring the issues created by the Customs Union. As countries transform into information societies, they are inclined to work together and allow the free movement of money, products, and services. The Customs Union, therefore, is a vital necessity. In addition to exporting to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan, we also export to Russia and Belarus. This has been made simpler by the common economic space.</p><h4>Kazakhstan is a big country with a dispersed population. What strategies are you following to ensure the timely delivery of your products?</h4><p>We realize that it is very important to deliver medical products to our customers in the shortest possible time. Our products are supplied to distribution companies with branches in various oblasts around Kazakhstan. We constantly monitor stock levels at these branches, and in this way our customers are always able to find what they are looking for.</p><h4>How can the challenges of the pharmaceuticals sector be turned into investment opportunities?</h4><p>Before we invested in Kazakhstan, we conducted research and discovered a lack of domestic manufacturers operating with modern technology. We then filled this niche, thus seizing the opportunity to create the best-equipped factory in the region, and produce quality medical products. Moreover, in accordance with our evaluation of the pharmaceuticals market, and by maintaining constant liaisons with medical doctors, we determine market demands and introduce new medical products onto the scene. Determining market demands is not easy—our biggest advantage is that we employ experienced and professional staff.</p><h4>What is Nobel Pharma's level of involvement with clinical research in the country?</h4><p>The clinical research of our products is performed by leading medical doctors in the country, under the supervision of the sales department of our company. Clinical research on Immustim, an oncology drug, is in full swing right now. It is vital that we confirm clinically the effectiveness and safety of our products.</p><h4>What progressive steps are necessary to encourage the development of the pharmaceuticals sector?</h4><p>The state lends extensive support to domestic manufacturers for the development of the pharmaceutical sector. We are satisfied by the current state of affairs, and are also seriously committed to work in this direction. We are expecting new amendments in customs duties, which will allow us to decrease the cost of our products. This way we will be able to enhance our performance quality and extend the range of our production.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for 2012?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a very powerful country both in its region and among the countries of the CIS. Currently, very deliberate economic policies are being implemented, and this condition is going to persist into 2012. The current situation gives a sense of security to investors like us. Even during the current global economic crisis, Kazakhstan remains one of the most sustainable countries for investment.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dare-to-succeed]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Astana Group was first created by the establishment of Astana Motors in 1992. What have been the corner stones of your group's evolution over the past 20 years?</h4><p>The group was established in 1992 with Astana Motors right after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The country was devastated and there was a deficit of all consumer goods. We were the first to import Japanese car brands such as Toyota, Nissan, and Subaru, and worked with well-known Japanese trading houses such as Nissho Iwai and Sojitz Corporation. Our mission was to create a civilized auto retail market in Kazakhstan. In 1996, when the privatization process started, we started buying silos, milling complexes, and pasta factories. We invested by bringing in new equipment, and as of today we are the leaders in the production of pasta and flour, exporting our products to close to 10 countries. We are also entering into the livestock breeding business. We imported 400 head of Aberdeen Angus breed calves from Australia. We will participate in another auction in Australia to purchase 2,000 more calves from Adelaide, one of the biggest auctions in the livestock industry. We have plans to develop the livestock breeding business into a fully fledged operation and become a source of quality beef in the region.</p><h4>How do you see your livestock activities developing in the medium run?</h4><p>My vision is that ultimately we want to create a system of quality livestock breeding to increase meat production in our country. By doing this, in five years time we will be exporting beef to neighboring countries, especially to Russia, which is the best meat export destination considering its annual meat import potential. Our export focus on livestock production will differ from our grain export business. While the latter targets countries in Central Asia, the former will concentrate mainly on the Russian market. A small share of livestock production will be dedicated to halal meat, targeting countries in the Middle East and Gulf region. Our livestock base is very conveniently located 50 kilometers from the Russian border in the Kostanay oblast. This location is very convenient in terms of logistics.</p><div class="quote">“We are shifting from being just an import business to a more production-focused one."</div><h4>Where do you see more potential as far as non-extractive industries are concerned?</h4><p>We are importing cattle from Australia, and we will also be bringing in stud bulls from North Dakota. The reason behind our decision to do this is a world practice that we chose to follow, whereby a breed can be improved through the introduction of different blood lines. We have plans to go to North Dakota in order to develop Kazakhstan's livestock breeding business and bring it up to the standards of Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. We have to pick the best breeds and methods employed around the world. In Kazakhstan we have a local breed called “Kazakhstanskaya Belogolovaya" which can gain 600-700 grams in weight per day, whereas the Aberdeen Angus, which we will import, gains up to a kilogram per day. This converts into economics in terms of cost of production, while the quality of the meat is better than existing local standards. By importing this breed we are entering into the premium segment and potentially will supply chilled beef, for which the demand is high in Russia, as well as deep-frozen meat. While doing this we benefit from the expertise of an Australian consulting company. Everything needs to be right from the start. There will be an Australian family moving to our premises in Kostanay to work with the cattle and develop this business.</p><h4>Astana Motors has a 16% share in the new automobile market. How is the sector developing?</h4><p>In 2007 we reached our peak, with 11,000 cars sold. Before that, every year we doubled our sales. In 3Q2007 we faced the mortgage crunch in the US, which affected the Kazakhstani economy and our sales dropped drastically. In 2010 we experienced a historical low, with only 2,000 units sold. During this downshift we incurred $30 million in losses. Over this period we learned how to survive such downturns by focusing on spare parts, services, and cost efficiencies. As external macroeconomic factors improved our sales also went up. In 2011 we sold 6,200 units, with higher profitability than when we sold 11,000 units. Thanks to the crisis we learned how to conduct our business more profitably. Our target for 2012 is to double and pass the levels for 2011, which will exceed our pre-crisis levels. In 2011 we launched an assembly plant for Hyundai commercial vehicles. We decided that this is a very interesting area for us. Hyundai Motor Company is a very strong company and brand worldwide. Locally assembled trucks will be sold in Kazakhstan and within the Customs Union. It is unprecedented in our history that now we export trucks assembled in Kazakhstan to Belarus. Hyundai is also considering supplying the Azerbaijani market from Kazakhstan, with possible exports to Russia as well. All this is happening because of the Customs Union. In April 2012 we will begin to assemble buses, which is a new area for our business. We are shifting from being just an import business to a more production-focused one. Within the assembly business we are not only importing, but also looking for local suppliers for spare parts, such as accumulators. Of course, we will not be building engines in 10 years, but one should not forget that this is where South Korea started out 40 years ago. Our Korean partners are advising us that if we do not start from somewhere, we will not navigate away from our dependence on the extractive industries.</p><h4>How do you assess the current state of demand for retail space in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Being involved in the automotive sector and then having grain in our portfolio, we had time to expand our business into other niches as the Kazakhstani market is small. We saw that Kazakhstan lacked quality retail space and shopping malls. Following our philosophy of being the most cutting-edge company of our type in the country, we invited leading foreign architects to design retail locations and support us during the initial stage of managing our shopping centers. Today, the supply of quality conceptual retail space differs in Kazakhstan from region to region. In Astana there is a surplus of shopping areas; however, if you look at other regions there is a deficit of retail space, as purchasing power is still low. We want to meet and even anticipate the demand right across Kazakhstan. Therefore, we are building retail space across Kazakhstan, taking into account future increases in purchasing power. A measure that shows quality space per 1,000 inhabitants indicates that while there is 400 sqm of class A retail space for 1,000 people in Astana, in Almaty it is 120 sqm. Hence, we started the construction of a second Mega Center in Almaty. It will contain a number of restaurants—not of a food court type, but targeted facilities for the premium segment with gourmet tastes. Plus, the cyber zone will offer teenagers new entertainment options. And of course we will have new world brands entering the Kazakhstan market such as H&amp;M, Marks &amp; Spencer, Massimo Dutti, Forever 21, and GANT. In Q12012, Burger King will also open in MEGA Almaty.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Turkcell Technology's R&amp;D capability?</h4><p>When I joined Turkcell at the end of 2006, my aim was to start Turkcell Technology as a branch company focused on R&amp;D. In 2007, we consolidated many different departments involved with R&amp;D, with the vision of developing a single R&amp;D department. We started with approximately 40 employees, but over the past five years we have reached more than 400. Since the beginning, we have invested in specific areas of research. For example, we heavily invest in SIM technology, as the SIM card is a mobile operator's only asset in the customer's pocket. We are also developing mobile marketing solutions. We are designing, executing, managing, and monitoring our campaigns with these tools, which saves us the operational and intellectual effort needed to govern a vast amount of customized offerings. Mobile internet usage is growing, and we want to grow our mobile internet business. In this respect, smartphones and related technologies are within our focus area. Our current target is to upgrade every mobile user in Turkey to a smartphone. To achieve this goal, we are introducing Turkcell-branded new smart handsets to the market at price ranges realistic for the Turkish mobile subscriber base. Furthermore, we offer many value-added services, such as rich voice and communication services. Our R&amp;D teams will continue to develop these profitable value-added services in 2012. We are reinvesting the incentives we obtain from R&amp;D back into R&amp;D. Our Applied Research Division has been founded to conduct research in newly developing technologies with the aim of giving Turkcell a competitive edge through the development of products and services that fit Turkcell Group's needs and business models.</p><h4>What have been your most successful value-added services?</h4><p>We have a very simple value-added service that I can give as an example. When somebody calls you while your phone is out of reach, Turkcell will send you a missed call notification in the form of an SMS. When you see the notification, you'll call the person back—and this is one way in which we have increased the volume of calls. But we have more complex and innovative services as well. For example, if you receive a second call while you are talking on your mobile, you can now spontaneously see who is calling and choose to finish your current call to take the second one. Another huge initiative is the introduction of mobile financial services, which we have recently added to our portfolio. There are 20 million unbanked people in Turkey, and we target those who are obliged to make financial transactions, even if they don't have a bank account. Moreover, if you want to transfer money at the weekend, all you need is the recipient's phone number to easily transfer funds.</p><div class="quote">“When I joined Turkcell at the end of 2006, my aim was to start Turkcell Technology as a branch company focused on R&amp;D."</div><h4>How do you keep mobile financial services secure?</h4><p>We have different levels of security. On our Mobile Financial Services solution, financial and non-financial transactions triggered by the SIM menu in the SIM card and each message transmitted are encrypted with SIM keys that are known only to the mobile network operator. In addition, the client SIM application does not keep any real financial information; no real card number, no card pin, and no password. All transactions are done using the mobile phone number or the aliases defined in the application and the Mobile Payment Gateway by MasterCard. The recipients will only be able to claim the transfer if they know the exact amount transferred and the name of the person who sent the money. The recipient can go to an ATM and enter the telephone number and password. If the recipient is also a mobile financial services user, he can directly withdraw the money with his defined card.</p><h4>Which banks have you partnered with?</h4><p>We are currently operating this service in partnership with Garanti Bank and Akbank. Yet, eventually, every large bank will be a part of our system. Although we are targeting the non-banking sector of the market, we need the support of banks, too. In addition, we are partnering with other banks such as Denizbank, Vakıf Bank, İş Bank, and Bank Asya to provide our customers with a wider variety of mobile financial services from contactless payment to payment for highway tolls. It's like a “mobile wallet" that uses Near Field Technology (NFC). Our customers carry cards that allow them to pay just by touching the card to a POS device. For financial transactions, there is a security algorithm, generally defined by MasterCard or Visa. We have moved these security requirements to the mobile phone, in partnership with MasterCard.</p><h4>What are Turkcell Technology's regional expansion plans?</h4><p>Currently, Turkcell is the third largest operator in Europe in terms of number of subscribers, and we firmly believe that we can be a model for every other operator in the world. We strategically offer our creative services and technology to other companies. We have used our campaign management system throughout the region, and it has been successful in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Kuwait. The first step is to cover the local market, and develop products exclusively for Turkcell. The next steps are to offer our products to our shareholder TeliaSonera, and our customers in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In 2011, we exported a number of services to Zain Kuwait, one of the leading telecommunications companies in the Middle East.</p><h4>What role does Turkcell Technology play in encouraging young entrepreneurs?</h4><p>We are putting a lot of effort into our universities. We offer third-year students internships and part-time work opportunities. During that period, we also encourage them to work on projects that they can apply to their studies. These students develop our projects with their academic knowledge. We also award 50 Master's degree scholarships to students working with us. We invest in our country's young people, whether they establish their own companies or work with Turkcell in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[priority-hubs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did the current trade mission choose Qatar and the UAE specifically?</h4><p>We chose Qatar and the UAE for three main reasons. First, both countries are investing heavily in infrastructure and transportation, to the tune of $300 billion combined. Second, both countries have strong economic growth projections during the short, medium, and long term. Third, these countries have histories as profitable markets and business hubs for many American companies. Since the beginning of this administration, these markets have been some of our top priorities. In addition to my trips to the region, our Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance, Michael Camuñez, and our Assistant Secretary for Trade Promotion, Suresh Kumar, have also visited both countries in order to promote further trade and investment.</p><h4>The Gulf has been identified as a priority market for the US. What factors went into this calculation, and specifically what makes the region as a whole stand out?</h4><p>The Gulf is showing strong economic growth projections in the short, medium, and long term. Additionally, American companies face increased competition from East Asian, South Asian, and European businesses in the region. Thus, it behooves the American government to increase its work in as close collaboration as possible with our private sector, which is competing against foreign firms. The American government has always been dedicated to its relationships with the Gulf, and our private sector has always been active in the region. President Obama's National Export Initiative provides us a platform to show the Gulf that our government and private sector are each, and together, committed to the region and our continued economic and commercial relationships. As a region, what stands out to me is the vision for the future that the governments of the Gulf countries have taken. They see the need and opportunity for economic diversification. While oil and gas is, and will continue to be, an important sector—one in which we have been and will continue to be involved—many of the regions have a vision to invest in their people by investing in health, education, and new technologies, all using environmentally sound strategies, and we have competitive advantages in each of these areas.</p><div class="quote">“The Gulf is showing strong economic growth projections in the short, medium, and long term."</div><h4>Dubai has emerged as a regional hub for investment and business activities throughout the Middle East. What has made Dubai so successful in this way?</h4><p>Dubai, like the UAE, has benefited from strong and visionary leadership. You often hear a country say it hopes to become a hub for trade and investment. Well, Dubai never rested on its laurels. It began laying the groundwork as a regional hub in the 1970s and early 1980s, dredging its ports to handle large ships, creating free trade zones, and developing a world class airline and airport. Perhaps, then, Dubai's success is directly correlated not only to its visionary leadership, but the action that leadership has taken—it has never said it “hopes to be." Rather, it says, “we will be."</p><h4>Historically, what has the trade relationship been like between the US and the UAE, Dubai specifically, and what key developments have you witnessed?</h4><p>The US-UAE trade relationship is marked by the same characteristics as are our political, military, and strategic relationship: friendship, dedication, and collaboration. US-UAE trade has almost quadrupled in the last decade from $3.3 billion in 2000 to $12.8 billion in 2011. Each year, the UAE is the largest, or one of the largest, destinations for American exports in the Middle East and North Africa. While the energy sector is still a major contributor to the UAE's GDP, and our companies have been and will continue to be very active in that sector, our trade relationship has expanded into consumer products, services, and almost anything else you can think of. Today, US companies are already active in the country's moves into renewable energy, education, and other activities undertaken to diversify its economy and provide greater opportunities for its population. In regard to Dubai specifically, we have been a partner in the Emirate's impressive growth since the beginning. Our trade relationship with Dubai has continued to mature.</p><h4>In which industries and sectors do you see the most potential for greater commercial integration between Dubai and the US?</h4><p>I never like to limit the products or services that I cover when I speak about opportunities for US—UAE commercial integration. We shouldn't limit our imagination. Already one has seen American companies participate in Dubai's impressive growth across many sectors; from energy to water, from glass to coffee outlets, from automobiles to speedboats and yachts, and from shoes and clothing to jewelry. For instance, Pottery Barn opened its first Middle East store in Dubai, to take advantage of the Emirate's purchasing power. Additionally, the UAE is a top destination for American SMEs; from 2007-2008, the UAE was one of the markets with the largest percentage increases in SME exports to the world. Today's global economy is so diverse and changes so quickly, that it is almost impossible for anyone to say what is going to be hot tomorrow. So, rather than naming a specific sector, I can say that commercial integration between Dubai and the US is going to be based on products, services, technologies, and individuals that are dedicated to mutually beneficial commercial relationships that help create knowledge and economic return for both sides.</p><h4>Dubai policy makers are consistently praised for their efforts in creating a business friendly environment and for supporting industries operating in the region. Would you say there are any further regulatory changes needed to attract more businesses to Dubai?</h4><p>In a global economy that is as fluid and competitive as the one in which we operate, there is increasing pressure on nearly all governments to ensure their regulatory environments can keep up with changing economies, and that there is transparency. Dubai has rightfully earned its favorable reputation as a good place to do business. And a large part of that reputation stems from the excellent counseling and assistance offered to foreign companies by the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, the Dubai Department of Economic Development, and other government organizations geared to promoting trade and investment. Of course there are always areas for improvement. US (and other foreign) firms often cite the restrictions on foreign ownership, the requirement of having a local agent in order to do business in the UAE, and difficulties in terminating agents as some of the issues affecting their investment decisions in Dubai and the UAE. I understand that the new revisions to the Companies Law that was just passed by the UAE. Cabinet will allow more than 49% foreign ownership in certain sectors. We will be following these new developments closely and welcome any changes that make it easier for our firms to do business in the UAE. Additionally, another concern I have heard from American companies across industries, vis-í -vis Dubai, is a need for increased transparency in regulatory development.</p><h4>In 2009 the Abu Dhabi government initiated a $25 billion plan to develop its transport system. What opportunities does this investment present US companies in the infrastructure/multimodal sector?</h4><p>This question helped drive much of our schedule in Abu Dhabi. I hope not to sound hyperbolic, but American companies offer the best products and services associated with infrastructure and multi-modal transportation. From building runways and railways, to being top-notch project managers, to providing airports and airlines the products and services they need to meet increased domestic, regional and international demand, to ensuring that all such investments are done in a sustainable fashion, our companies have a competitive advantage. The role of the American private sector, I believe, will be one of developing mutually beneficial partnerships through which our companies help Abu Dhabi achieve its ambitious development goals by providing know how and technology, while Abu Dhabi will provide the project opportunities and enable our companies to gain further insights into the business culture of this important region.</p><h4>What is your outlook for US businesses operating in Dubai and for the region as a whole in the coming year?</h4><p>I am bullish on our companies operating in Dubai and in the region. Our exports to the UAE were up almost 35% for January-October, 2011, versus the same period in 2010. Despite regional political unrest, the Gulf has generally remained stable and is making heavy investments to address many of the socioeconomic concerns of its citizens. American businesses must be ready to compete, of course; but they have the technology, products, and business know-how to do so. In 2012, like in years past, you'll see American companies visiting Dubai's trade shows, meeting with potential partners from throughout the region, and inviting them to visit their sites and facilities in the US.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investments has Frontier Mining made in the Benkala copper plant project in Aktobe?</h4><p>The project has two stages of investment. The first stage requires approximately $54 million and the second stage will call for an additional investment of $74 million. So far we have invested about $48 million, and we have about $6 million to go before the first stage can be completed. The plant is scheduled to begin production in April 2012, and it will be the first plant in Kazakhstan capable of producing copper from ore, a well-known technology, comprising 20% of the world's copper extraction processes. We began our company working with gold production. However, we ceased the production of gold and decided to focus on copper. All of our copper deposits are located in Kazakhstan. We are currently capable of producing 7,000 tons of copper per year and we aim to increase our capacity to 20,000 tons in 2012.</p><h4>How does Kazakhstan's copper industry contribute to the world supply?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a small producer of copper. We work with two types of copper: oxides and sulfides. The technology used to extract both is different. Over millions of years the top layer of red copper rusts and you end up with oxides. The copper in oxides has generally separated from the rock and sits in free form. We crush the copper ore, leach it with sulfuric acid, and plate the copper out using electricity. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s Kazakhstan did not have the technology needed to produce copper leached from oxides. It was extracted and put into large dumps of ore. Now, some companies are processing the copper in these dumps using new technology.</p><div class="quote">“We need to increase the number of independent small producers because they are driving the industry."</div><h4>How do you see the role of small- or mid-sized producers like Frontier Mining in realizing the full potential of Kazakhstan's mining sector?</h4><p>We need to increase the number of independent small producers because they are driving the industry, researching the technology, and industrializing the country. We help the country by creating jobs and investing in new technologies.</p><h4>How can Kazakhstan take advantage of its mining resources more fully?</h4><p>Every year, Kazakhstan pays international consultants millions of dollars to design processes and plants, and advise about the industry. We have started investing heavily to develop an expertise here and to spread the knowledge throughout the industry. The sooner we do it, the better. In the future, we want to be able to consult other companies throughout the world on the production of, say, uranium. There are also a lot of segments based around the extracting industry, such as machinery, equipment, education and analysis, and chemical laboratories. With the expansion of the mining industry, these segments will grow as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stay-safe-stay-strong]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Global Finance recently declared Santander Mexico to be the safest bank in Mexico in 2011. What factors do you feel have contributed the most to this result?</h4><p>The reasons are mainly in the policies of the bank regarding its control of operations and the efficiency of the bank's processes, but also in the long term-credits and the total assets. It's also an extremely safe bank because we excel at covering aspects related to money laundering. These awards are proof of our strong position in Mexico and our confidence in growth expectations.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the bank's performance in 2011?</h4><p>Santander Mexico is ranked fourth in terms of the contribution of benefits to the group. Santander Mexico has built a very solid retail banking franchise; some years ago we bought two banks here in Mexico in bad terms and now we are the biggest investment bank in the country. We are also the strongest commercial banking franchise in the country, not in terms of size but of effectiveness. These numbers have made us one of the most productive banks in the global group.</p><div class="quote">“The bank considers the SME segment as one of its key targets in its expansion strategy."</div><h4>How have ratings fluctuations affected Santander Mexico?</h4><p>It hasn't affected us at all. If cuts continue for European banks, then it is possible we could be affected at some point. Our corporate policy is that our subsidiaries work in an autonomous way. This doesn't mean that we are independent from our HQ, but we have a certain level of autonomy that allows us to take special actions based on local market conditions. At the same time, in 2011, Mexico has been one of the key markets for the group and we are experiencing strong consolidation in all segments. So for the moment, I don't envision any changes in our current corporate structure as a result of changes from the ratings agencies.</p><h4>What share does the SME segment have in your lending portfolio?</h4><p>The bank considers the SME segment as one of its key targets in its expansion strategy. Our target is to have a 20% market share, and we think there is impressive growth potential in this area. We had a market share of 4% in 2007, now we have 19%. Our growth this year was at 40% in the portfolio, with positive estimates of 30% in 2012 also in our portfolio. We have products suited to the needs of SMEs that allow them to become better organized both administratively and financially, such as POS terminals. We have deals with different companies such as PwC and Windows in order to offer SMEs an affordable package allowing them to learn how to use programs to produce quality information on accounts and corporate organization. We are the top partner of Nacional Financiera—a government bank that targets SME industrial development—to offer SME-accessible credits.</p><h4>What led Santander to acquire GE Capital's mortgage assets as well as Bank of America's 24% share in Santander Mexico?</h4><p>The acquisition of Bank of America's 24% stake was a way of growing in a country where there is a lack of quality M&amp;A opportunities. The acquisition is aimed at consolidating our presence in the country. At present, banks in the US are under heavy pressure from the international markets as they exit the debt crisis. We thus decided that it was the right time to make the acquisition. Concerning GE Capital's mortgage assets, according to our expansion program, we found it the most attractive deal in the market in order to increase our penetration in this segment, but I have to underline that we have recorded important organic growth also. With this acquisition Santander Mexico became the second most important bank in the market and the first in residential mortgages, which was our target.</p><h4>What is your assessment of Mexico's fund industry, and how will it evolve?</h4><p>In our country we have a mature and low-risk investment funds industry. It is exceptional to hear examples of crises relating to these financial instruments as are seen in other markets. In our case, we offer our customers different schemes, even with international funds where other institutions take part as brokers. We don't offer schemes to everybody because we need to be conscious about each profile, and because our clients always welcome having the best options. Our bank has found success in motivating its customers in using these instruments. Our strategies are always focused in our clients.</p><h4>Mexico's sovereign credit rating is considered stable. Do you envision any change in this rating taking into account that we are entering an election period?</h4><p>Fortunately no. We have already mentioned that Mexico has a sound financial system. Its macroeconomic fundamentals are the other factors making Mexico a market for growth, attractive and with a very different behavior. It has a debt ratio of 30% of its GDP, a deficit of 0.5%, and a low inflation rate. All these factors make of Mexico a good quality risk country and, therefore, the sovereign risk is financed at low prices and its volatility is minimal in relative terms. In this past crisis, Mexico's sovereign risk has been around 100 and 200 basic points, which is a relatively low margin. In fact, the probability is for the rating to be raised rather than being lowered.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Det.Al Holding's background story?</h4><p>Det.Al Holding is a foreign company using advanced technologies and operating in the mining of iron ore and alunite. It is a leader in non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy, the processing of iron ore concentrate, and the production of pellets, DRI, steel, aluminum, and primary aluminum. Being an investment company, Det.Al Holding has a track record of investments and successful cooperation with several industrial enterprises. As of today, Det.Al Holding has subsidiary companies in the sphere of iron ore, alunite, aluminum, and steel production. Dashkesan Filizsaflashdirma, an iron ore company that started producing concentrated iron ore from 2010, is also exporting to foreign markets. Other divisions of our holding are Det.Al Steel and Det.Al Aluminum, which is successfully constructing an aluminum producing smelter in the city of Ganja. Det.Al Holding has also laid the foundation of the Integrated Steel Complex in Azerbaijan, including the design and construction of an iron ore concentration plant with a capacity of 2 million tons per year, a pellet plant with capacity for 2 million tons per year, a direct reduction plant with capacity for 1.1 million tons per year, and a steelmaking plant with capacity for 1 million tons a year. We are committed to the development of Azerbaijan, and currently Det.Al Holding provides around 4,000 jobs.</p><h4>What are your current expectations for output at the aluminum smelter in Ganja?</h4><p>Phase I of the greenfield Ganja Aluminum Smelter, which will have an annual capacity of 50,000 tons of primary aluminum, began in October 2011 and the completion of Phase II with the same capacity is expected in late 2012. The smelter plant meets the highest technological, environmental, and quality standards, and by the end of the year about 500 people will be working there. The new aluminum smelter plant is located within Det.Al Aluminum's aluminum factory complex, where we are constructing a semi-fabrication plant as well. The new complex will produce 50,000 tons of high-quality primary aluminum of the A-7 type and 50,000 tons of aluminum coiled sheets annually. We expect to finish both Phase II of the smelter plant and the pre-fabrication plant by 2014, and Ganja Aluminum Plant will supply the main raw materials for the complex. The available established infrastructure gives us an opportunity to increase annual production to 200,000 tons in the future after additional investment. This new complex will also add annual production capacity to Azerbaijan Aluminum's smelter in Sumgait, which currently produces 60,000 tons of primary aluminum per year, and Ganja Aluminum Refinery, which produces 450,000 tons of metallurgical grade aluminum.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of aluminum production capacity and demand in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In the last few years we have been implementing projects to increase the country's production capacity due to the high demand for aluminum in neighboring countries. As an example, the main market is Turkey, where we are in negotiations with important traders. However, we cannot forget about the European market, as it is another important destination for Azerbaijan's aluminum production. At the same time, demand in Azerbaijan is increasing and for now we expect that about 30% to 35% of our production will cover local demand and the rest will go to foreign markets.</p><div class="quote">“This is a very attractive industry for foreign investors at the moment, because the government is creating incentives and favorable conditions."</div><h4>What has Det.Al Holding contribution to the rebirth of Azerbaijan's metal industry been?</h4><p>Det.Al Holding is the main aluminum company in Azerbaijan, producing and exporting high quantities of aluminum from our refinery and other semi-fabricated products. We have boosted the country's capacity over the years through the construction of industrial complexes and related infrastructure. At the same time, Det.Al Holding is one of the main steel producers in Azerbaijan from iron ore, and we currently have 300 million tons of approved reserves of iron ore. Also, in the last few years we have introduced the latest technologies to the production chain, and we are currently implementing measures to rehabilitate our reserves, improve facilities, and increase the capacity and quality of our products. We are also working on the construction of a new pelletization factory in Ganja, which is one of the major projects in this segment, with a concentrated production capacity of 1.2 million tons a year. It will be fully completed by 2016.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the ferrous and non-ferrous metals industry in Azerbaijan for 2012 and onwards?</h4><p>This is a very attractive industry for foreign investors at the moment, because the government is creating incentives and favorable conditions for potential companies to develop their activities in the country. Also, Azerbaijan holds huge potential in the mining sector and in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals industry. Therefore, I can see many foreign investors investing in Azerbaijan in the next few years. In this regard, Det.Al Holding is also working on attracting FDI for all of its industrial projects in the aluminum and steel segments, and we have seen a high level of interest in our ongoing projects. The business environment is favorable for investors and the potential the country offers is tremendous.</p><h4>What other economic advantages does Azerbaijan offer for foreign investors?</h4><p>First of all, Azerbaijan has positively evolved in the region over the last five years. Today, Azerbaijan's business environment is very safe. It has seen consistent economic development, favorable legislation, and political and financial stability. Such conditions cannot be found in neighboring countries; therefore, Azerbaijan offers better investment opportunities when compared to other countries in the Caucasus, and also when compared to Central Asia and most other CIS countries. In addition, there are major infrastructure projects being implemented at the moment, and such projects will strengthen Azerbaijan's position at the international level.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What technologies have been introduced in Ecuador by Huawei?</h4><p>Our first big contract was in 2002, for fiber optic SDH rings in Guayaquil. We have always worked to introduce the latest technology in Ecuador. Since 2004, we have introduced broadband and DSL, DWDM fiber-optic transmission, and next generation networks. In 2007, we introduced 3G technology to Claro. The entire Claro 3G network is Huawei technology. We also introduced code division multiple access (CDMA) in 2008 to CNT and Etapa. This CDMA network provides very wide rural coverage. The government can now provide telecommunications and internet to many rural areas. This is part of the government's effort to close the digital gap. We offer more bandwidth to the user with WiMax, IPTV, and fiber to the home (FTTH) systems. In 2012 we will continue to promote some new technologies in the local market, for example, Long Term Evolution (LTE)—the 4th generation mobile technology and cloud computing.</p><h4>What are the challenges of entering the smartphone market?</h4><p>The main challenge is we lack experience in the consumer market. Over the past 20 years, we have focused only on the carrier business, and we haven't directly dealt with consumers. Even though we started our handset business in 2003, we only dealt with carriers as OEM and ODM suppliers, like Vodafone or T-Mobile. In 2011, Huawei set up its Global Design Center for handsets in London. Some design masters from Germany and Japan joined the company as well. Our product capability has rapidly reached top class. We have introduced the slimmest smartphone in the world, just 6.68 mm thick. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March 2012, we are also announcing a new smartphone equipped with a self-developed quad-core 1.5GHz CPU, which will be the most powerful handset in terms of hardware performance. However, we still need to learn a lot about public branding and marketing.</p><div class="quote">“Since 2004, we have introduced broadband and DSL, DWDM fiber-optic transmission, and next generation networks."</div><h4>What are the advantages of your service and product portfolio?</h4><p>The advantages of Huawei are mainly in technology and solutions. We have a very broad portfolio. There are some leading technology companies in three major telecoms network areas: mobile, fixed, and IP. Among them, Huawei is the only one ranked in the top three in all three areas. For enterprise solutions we have the widest scope in ICT technology. Our customer-oriented R&amp;D capability can rapidly respond to requirements from the market.</p><h4>What are the applications of the cloud computing model for Ecuador?</h4><p>Huawei's cloud computing solution was launched in 2010. Since 2011, the Ecuadorean government, enterprises, and telecoms operators raised a lot of requirements. We are currently working on that to explore the opportunities in this field. For cloud computing, data centers are the most important infrastructure to develop. In the Chinese market, every Huawei smartphone user gets 160 GB space in the cloud for data backup and for storage.</p><h4>Will Huawei be implementing 4G in Ecuador?</h4><p>In 2011, we signed Latin America's first commercial LTE contract with UNE EPM Telecommunications, a Colombian company. Huawei is a leading LTE vendor in essential patents and in commercial applications. We are ready to offer LTE solutions, and it simply depends on the operators and the spectrum allocation.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What encouraged you to move from the diplomatic field into the telecoms industry and move back to Baku to establish AzQtel-SAZZ?</h4><p>My interest was not so much in the telecommunications sector in general, but the development of the internet and internet services in emerging economies. When I started to work in the international market, I came to realize that the development of the internet was one of the most attractive products to export from the US to developing countries, because it is needed to support companies from all types of sectors such as media, banking, and energy. Toward the end of the 20th century the world started to shift into the digital era, offering great business opportunities and growth potential, and increasing the feeling of globalization among people. After serving as a formal and informal diplomat for Azerbaijan—my home country—for many years, I decided to move into international business, first running the business development department within a company very active in the ICT sector in different parts of the world, testing internet technology in various countries. Finally, I convinced my partners and shareholders to put all of our focus and emphasis on the Azerbaijani market, because of the importance given by President Ilham Aliyev to the ICT sector and the potential growing market that was forming here, where internet penetration was still low and data access was very expensive. From the first stages of our deployment in Azerbaijan, we have been focusing on wireless broadband internet technologies, testing WiMAX technologies. In 2005, we incorporated AzQtel into our operations, and in 2006 we were granted radio frequency licenses. Between 2008 and 2009 we developed a commercial pilot plan, covering downtown Baku with 19 base stations. It was a success and in the following two years we started to expand our network, and we managed to cover all of Baku and other cities like Sumgait and Mingachevir, building more than 180 new base stations. In 2010 we also underwent a rebranding exercise, adopting the name SAZZ, creating a new and more modern logo, and implementing a new marketing strategy, which brought us a solid reputation within the country for being a quality wireless broadband provider with affordable prices—AZN25 for unlimited downloads with up to 10 Mbps speed, and a 24/7 technical support center.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Mobile WiMAX technology as compared to other internet technologies?</h4><p>We have yet to see the worldwide deployment of 4G technology, Azerbaijan included. The wireless market in our country offers different possibilities: GPRS, HSDPI, and 3G. As compared to the latter, WiMAX is superior in terms of bandwidth and Sazz has also brought affordable prices to the table. Another important factor to keep in mind is that WiMAX technology has been implemented worldwide with high levels of success, and in this regard analysts and vendors have named us as one of the 10 most successful WiMAX deployments around the world after taking into account our entrance into the market and the rate of customer subscriptions.</p><h4>What level of coverage does your network currently provide, and what are your strategic plans to expand it?</h4><p>At the moment we cover all of Baku, Sumgait, Mingachevir, and the vast majority of suburban areas located by the Caspian Sea on the Absheron Peninsula, reaching about 3 million people under our coverage. We are currently in our third expansion phase, in which we will be adding 240 more base stations, and reaching the regions of Azerbaijan starting from Ganja, where our services will soon be available. Toward the end of 2012 we will be covering the vast majority of each regional city center in places like Gabala, Sheki, Gusar, and Lenkaran.</p><div class="quote">“Since we underwent the rebranding exercise, SAZZ has managed to attract tens of thousands of new customers."</div><h4>How has your customer base evolved over this period of time, and what is the company targeting for the future?</h4><p>Since we underwent the rebranding exercise, SAZZ has managed to attract tens of thousands of new customers, something we are very happy about. In this regard, 2011 was a very successful year. Right now, 85% of our customers are individuals, whereas the remaining 15% are banks and SMEs.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the level of internet penetration in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan was an underpenetrated market in terms of broadband, and even though internet penetration has grown rapidly in the last few years, the penetration rate is still low and the country is yet to achieve its peak. The explosion is still ahead of us, and both wireless and wired internet access service companies will be competing for the biggest piece of the Azerbaijani broadband cake for the next three to five years.</p><h4>What are AzQtel-Sazz's plans for the future?</h4><p>We are in a decisive expansion stage. Our major plan is to make Sazz a national broadband operator by spring 2013, and in so doing we can also move into a better competitive position from a coverage perspective. Looking at the Azerbaijani broadband market as a whole, we think that in five years from now there will be 4 million-5 million broadband users in Azerbaijan, and the aim is to grab at least 15%-20% of the market. Regardless of what happens in the future, it is a win-win situation for us, because today we already sell more USB modems than all the other wireless operators put together.</p><h4>In your opinion, how has the business environment in the ICT sector evolved in Azerbaijan over the last few years?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has a Soviet legacy in the telecommunications industry, and it does not need to build infrastructure and networks from scratch. Having said that, infrastructure is developing quickly thanks to government regulation and private companies, which are leading fast-paced growth in the sector. I think the appointment of Ali Abbasov as Minister of Communications and Information Technologies was a turning point within the sector, making it more vibrant. The internet has played a key role in broadening ICT sector perspectives. Many software development and system integrator firms have pushed the sector onward, making a difference overall. Today, you can see many Azerbaijani companies expanding their activities abroad, and that is a sign of how much the sector and the business environment in the sector has developed in the last few years. In this regard, AzQtel-SAZZ is also looking into expanding its activities abroad, with current negotiations with companies in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Sağlam Aile's core mission as a private healthcare provider?</h4><p>The idea behind our clinic is to protect the health of the youth, because they are the future of our country. At our core we put a lot of attention on health before marriage, because we believe we can improve the health of Azerbaijani family units by carrying out complete check ups, specializing in sexually transmitted infections (STIs), fertility treatment, as well as research on genetics and molecular issues. Therefore, we put a lot of emphasis on developing consciousness about health care among Azerbaijan's youth since our establishment in 2003. Also, we attach high significance to increasing young people's awareness of issues related to thalassemia. During the first years of our operations, it was hard to gain the trust and confidence of patients. However, the development of the country and its private healthcare system have been spurred on by the fact that the youth have come to understand the benefits of taking care of their health. Our policy is to bring in international standards and a more conscious health culture to Azerbaijan; to educate people to have regular check ups, and be able to treat potential diseases before it's too late. Today, we stand out thanks to the high level of technological innovation in our procedures and equipment, the quality of our staff, and our laboratory work, which covers more than 3,000 different types of laboratory tests and is managed by ISO 9001:2008 quality standards.</p><h4>How large are your operations in terms of facilities and services?</h4><p>At Sağlam Aile, we offer a wide range of specialized and high-quality services in the fields of dermatology, cosmetology, stomatology, pediatrics, cardiology, gynecology, STIs, genetics, molecular diagnostics, neurology, as well as plasmapheresis, and all forms of vaccinations. We currently have two different clinics in Baku. We have already expanded our existing facilities, have established one more center in Sumgait, and we plan on opening a center in Ganja in the near future. In terms of staff, we have a strong focus on young and highly qualified doctors and personnel, because they help us to attract young Azerbaijanis, making our brand successful. At the moment, we employ about 40 doctors and 52 staff at Saí°lam Aile, and have external consultants that come in when needed.</p><div class="quote">“Thanks to these international agreements we have been able to position Sağlam Aile one step ahead of the pack."</div><h4>How would you rate the abilities of Azerbaijani physicians?</h4><p>The level of Azerbaijani physicians' expertise and knowledge is rapidly growing thanks to the internationalization of our faculties. Many Azerbaijani doctors now study abroad for their university degrees, and this is definitely contributing to increasing the quality of health services in Azerbaijan, because while abroad they learn from internationally recognized institutions. In this regard, I think the bilateral relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan have positively helped to improve Azerbaijan's development in the medical field. At the same time, I would like to add that Saí°lam Aile is also contributing to such processes by hosting international conferences and sending its staff to international courses and seminars abroad. We see it as part of our commitment to the country's development.</p><h4>How are you planning to grow the institution from now on?</h4><p>In addition to expanding our facilities, we are constantly improving our services and modernizing our equipment and diagnostic testing processes. We are implementing many different healthcare packages in each of our specialized departments in order to achieve a higher level of quality in the diagnostics we provide our patients, as well as safeguarding them from suboptimal expenditure. We also believe that new technology plays an important role in people's lives, and we are increasing our presence on social networking sites as a way to develop a closer relationship with our customers as well as attract future patients. Finally, we are aiming to further organize international conferences and seminars in Baku. For example, we hosted a dermatology conference in 2011, attracting more than 600 specialists in the field, which was a big success. We believe that such events help to increase know-how in the medical field in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of development in the private healthcare sector, and how has Sağlam Aile contributed to this process of change?</h4><p>The last 20 years of Azerbaijan's history, since the country gained its independence, have been a period of development but also transition for many sectors, like the healthcare sector. There used to be a lack of confidence and trust in doctors, and in order to change that we have implemented different strategies such as free consultancies and special discounts because we want to show that our main aim is not to make a profit, but to ensure the wellbeing of patients. Over the years we have also established close ties with both Turkish and German institutions, and specialists from these countries come to Azerbaijan periodically to offer external consultancy services, sharing their expertise with our staff and patients. I believe the overall quality of service in the private healthcare sector has not yet reached international standards, though thanks to these international agreements we have been able to position Saí°lam Aile one step ahead of the pack. Overall, we see all these steps as part of our contribution to the development of the national healthcare system.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The 18.5% rise in exports between December 2010 and December 2011 to reach $135 billion was unprecedented. What is behind this success?</h4><p>In the past, there were no expectations for Turkey; however, now we are looking to the future. There have been huge changes within Turkey, and within Turkish society. At first, we were fighting a large inflation rate, and nobody could make any long-term investments or long-term plans. Turkey did not attract much FDI. Within the past 10 years we have achieved a measure of stability, and foreign investors now have trust in Turkey and its businessmen. Inflation rates have dropped, as have interest rates. FDI has doubled in the past eight years. Through both economic and democratic developments, we have a newly created middle class that is more interested in consuming and doing business by exporting Turkish goods. Also, another very important factor is our application to become a member of the EU, and part of the process is meeting the Maastricht Criteria. Compared to some other countries in Europe, Turkey is far in front of those criteria. In addition, Turkey is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.</p><h4>In what areas have exports increased of late?</h4><p>The most significant increase we have seen is in the Iraqi market. We reached about $8.2 billion at the end of 2011, which is a 37% increase from the previous year. Aside from that, the country we exported to most in 2011 was Germany, at around $13.8 billion, which is a 10% increase. The top countries we export to are Germany, Iraq, Italy, France, Russia, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, and Iran.</p><div class="quote">“In order to support innovation, TİM has paid more attention and interest to the R&amp;D, design, and branding side of companies' activities."</div><h4>Given that five of your top export destinations are in the euro zone, what sort of an impact do you think will be seen on Turkish exports over 2012?</h4><p>There might be some difficulties over 2012, and that is why we are trying to open up new markets. We are shifting focus somewhat to areas such as Africa and to the Asia-Pacific, including China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan, and also Latin America. These are our new target markets. In 2010 we were able to send trade delegations to over 30 countries with the President of Turkey, the Prime Minister of Turkey, and our Minister of Economy. In 2011, we made trips to 17 different countries and during those visits we conducted over 30,000 business meetings.</p><h4>What is the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TİM) doing internally to educate Turkish companies about export opportunities?</h4><p>Within Turkey we run training programs in 11 different cities, as well as 546 different programs for over 17,000 people. Our target is to give more importance to high value-added products.</p><h4>With respect to these value-added products, what is TİM doing to support innovation?</h4><p>In order to support innovation, TİM has paid more attention and interest to the R&amp;D, design, and branding side of companies' activities. In order to support our R&amp;D development we are carrying out R&amp;D projects market in six different sectors, and we are organizing design competition awards in all exporting sectors. We are going to build on these efforts throughout 2012.</p><h4>And within those six sectors that you have identified to concentrate on R&amp;D, which would you say has the most potential to be realized?</h4><p>The foremost is automotive, then chemicals, machinery, food processing, ready-to-wear textiles, and electronics. The automotive sector doesn't have good growth projections for 2012 as its main market is the EU. In that regard, manufacturers are working to maintain their present sales figures, which total around $20 billion.</p><h4>To what extent can Turkish exports reduce the current account deficit?</h4><p>Actually, the current deficit is not a recent issue, and we all know that Turkey is industrializing and growing, and our growth depends on our imports as well. We are always looking for very competitive currency exchange rates. Low exchange rates also encourage a rapid increase in imports. Those exchange rates are also affecting our deficits directly. However, because of the precautions we have taken recently, we believe that 2012 will be a year to balance the deficit. We believe that a stable exchange rate is the best way to go, and we are looking for around TL1.70 to TL1.80 to the dollar.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the Dubai Pearl project come about?</h4><p>Dubai Pearl is an entirely new project being developed with the support of Abu Dhabi's Al Fahim Group, one of the UAE's most highly respected business groups. The simplicity of the new master plan and modularity of the construction grid has made the Dubai Pearl project scalable and relatively easy to deliver and maintain. The scheme is flexible and adaptable to any change in future demand.</p><h4>What was your strategy when redesigning and reviving the original project plan?</h4><p>The design of the Dubai Pearl development is reflective of its location at one of Dubai's most prominent and strategic locations at the base of the Palm Jumeirah within the TECOM free zone—a mature free zone. This provides for 100% foreign ownership, and it enjoys 100% import and export tax exemption, 100% exemption from commercial levies, 100% repatriation of capital and profits, and only 5% import duty. Dubai has seen sustained interest in high-end developments from domestic and overseas buyers and we are aware that international buyer appetite for prime real estate opportunities is increasing. Comprising 1.86 million sqm, Dubai Pearl is currently the single largest luxury development being built in the emirate. It represents the next generation of luxury developments within the city, built to the highest architectural standards with an unrivalled grouping of global brand partners. We believe we have a unique and compelling offer in a market where the supply pipeline is slowing and where buyers are looking for the very best products.</p><h4>As an individual with extensive international business expertise, how would you characterize this particular market in comparison to the surrounding markets that you are familiar with?</h4><p>The global financial crisis has affected everyone in some way and Dubai is very much linked to the global economy, more so than perhaps any of its neighbors in the region, particularly given its international exposure in the real estate sector. Consequently, it was among the first to suffer with the downturn. This has presented the luxury property market here with some challenges and reduced overall confidence among some real estate developers. However, Dubai is also ahead of the curve in terms of its recovery with the prices generally stabilizing for quality properties. So despite existing challenges, this is the ideal time to be developing a project of this kind.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai Pearl is an entirely new project being developed with the support of Abu Dhabi's Al Fahim Group."</div><h4>What was your resource mobilization strategy in terms of financing the project?</h4><p>Pearl Dubai is being funded by a consortium of investors led by the UAE's Al Fahim Group. Al Fahim of Abu Dhabi is a highly reputed business group in the UAE with a diverse portfolio of business interests spread across the Middle East.</p><h4>The project was redesigned to include more residential space and less office space. Was this reflective of general low levels of demand for grade A commercial space in Dubai?</h4><p>We have maximized the commercial opportunity without cutting corners on the quality of the design. Dubai Pearl will ultimately provide a home for 9,000 people and a workplace for 12,000 with convenient freehold ownership.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the evolution of the real estate sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>The real estate sector has been very stable and we haven't been affected by any crises. Now that the government is working to improve the credit lines, we believe that this stability will be maintained.</p><h4>What is the organizational structure of Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf and how has it evolved?</h4><p>It began with two partners, and is still operated by members of the original families. The company has registered growth since it was established, and has become a large enterprise. We work toward operating in every segment of the construction sector; we build offices, shopping centers, hospitals, and underpasses. Our aim is diversification. We launched several new projects, and currently we have between 20 and 24 projects underway. Our main projects involve multi-housing and single housing units in the private sector. This is our principle focus.</p><h4>What was behind Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf's innovative “housing express" idea?</h4><p>The concept of vivienda express (housing express) reminds the public that it is very easy to purchase a house, and our company can both handle the customers' credit and complete the paperwork needed to make the transfers. We have agreements with several banks that qualify the client for a loan, and we have a credit team that rates the clients and matches them with the right bank. We have different products that suit every budget. The high demand from the middle class is a result of our system. Houses can be purchased anywhere from $40,000 to $200,000, depending on number of members in each family. In 2010, we sold more than 1,000 residences, and in 2011 we completed around 1,300.</p><h4>What special features make Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf different from competition?</h4><p>I believe that our brand is a recognized as serious and trustworthy. We have earned our name, and when we sell a project with the intention to finish in two years, we keep our word. In this way, we have never experienced any problems.</p><div class="quote">“We have earned our name, and when we sell a project with the intention to finish in two years, we keep our word."</div><h4>How do you ensure this level of efficiency?</h4><p>We are partnered with CYPCO, one of the largest companies in Chile. We have exchanged knowledge with CYPCO and we have learned from each other. For many projects, we receive technical advice.</p><h4>What are the characteristics of Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf's “intelligent building" projects?</h4><p>The intelligent building is a structure that requires less labor. It has security features and a central gas system, two innovations we did not offer previously. Each building has a central storage unit for gas. Every building is equipped with the internet. In general, every aspect of the structures is energy efficient, from the elevators to the lighting systems.</p><h4>In what sectors do you have the biggest demand?</h4><p>Housing and offices are primarily in demand. Demand for housing has increased since the Bank of the Social Security Institute of Ecuador (BIESS) introduced incentives for loans and mortgages. The percentage that BIESS lends for mortgage loans is higher than a normal bank. However, we are currently building a very large shopping center in partnership with Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ). The university has numerous resources and we are using that capital to benefit the student body. We will build a technologically advanced shopping center combined with educational facilities, a convention center, and cinemas. This shopping and educational center is a new concept for Ecuador.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the principal characteristics of the new wind farm you are developing in Puebla State?</h4><p>First of all, the wind farm is an idea that we decided to develop according to the environmental concerns we have in PI Mabe Group. The group has always sought ecological and sustainable products. We have developed the “bio-baby" diaper, the first biodegradable diaper in Mexico and in the world. We joined forces with APIA XXI Group, which is a Spanish company with its headquarters in Santander, in order to explore opportunities in the renewable energy sector. It has many years of experience in the renewable energy field, and has installed wind farms in Chile and Spain, as well as in Central Europe. We joined with them, and we began to monitor the principal zones of wind in Puebla. We know that Oaxaca has the best winds in the country, but we prefer Puebla because it has similar winds, but is closer to Mexico City, meaning additional logistical benefits. We began with measurement towers two years ago, and we had the support of President Calderon and his government.</p><h4>What unique capabilities did APIA XXI bring to the table to make it the company of choice for the development of the facilities, and how would you describe the creation of this joint venture?</h4><p>APIA XXI is a company that works remarkably faster than many other companies in the field. It has agile processes and impressive response times to any kind of issue in terms of project management and maintenance. It also has strong expertise as well as a good reputation in the wind segment. Instead of partnering with a big, slow, and expensive wind park development company we preferred the efficiency of APIA XXI. I think it was a good choice according to the job it is doing in developing our wind park.</p><div class="quote">“Wind energy has many advantages, and Mexico can be considered as one of the most important Latin American countries in terms of wind potential."</div><h4>What impact will this project have on national energy production from renewable resources?</h4><p>I think it will have an important impact because we plan to generate 364 MW in total. At present, wind power generation accounts for 509 MW in Oaxaca and 10 MW in Baja California. The state of Puebla didn't have a wind farm before we came along. We will cut the cost of energy coming from the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). Mexico needs a stronger production capacity in order to meet the future needs of our industries, and we have the opportunity to provide a stable supply of cost-effective energy to fuel their development.</p><h4>How will this new park positively affect the local communities where it will be built, and what impact will the new plant have on local power production?</h4><p>We instigated a large number of social studies at the local community level about how to involve the people of the area in this project. We focused our attention on the educational aspect, and we consider our project to be a driver of tourism and infrastructure development. We will be providing a bus system for children, and they can visit the park and attend special classrooms where we provide knowledge about the wind farm as well as present environmental issues and underscore the benefits emanating from the use of renewable energy sources. We are also studying how we can boost agricultural activities in this area by providing expertise and support to the agricultural communities of the area. Of course, from a labor point of view this project will generate new employment directly from the local community, and it will benefit everyone in Puebla state.</p><h4>Do you plan to develop new winds park in Mexico or abroad?</h4><p>At present we are concentrating our efforts on this project, and we are analyzing the possibility to build others in Mexico's different states. At an international level, we have a subsidiary in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How would you assess the renewable energy sector in Mexico and what potential do you envision in this field?</h4><p>Energy will be a fundamental aspect for Mexico's economic development. At present the cost of oil is increasing and it is far from being stable. Wind energy has many advantages, and Mexico can be considered as one of the most important Latin American countries in terms of wind potential. It will play a fundamental role in meeting the future energy needs of the country. If we compare the current installed capacity and Mexico's potential, there's a big gap and we have to fill this with new projects. The government is aware of these opportunities, and it is pushing the renewable energy agenda. The framework is there, but now it needs investment from the private sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led M&amp;M Logistics to set up in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>As a company, we've been operating for more than 120 years, and operate in over 36 countries. It was logical to set up in Kazakhstan, and our company has always been successful here. We brought in the European style of doing business, and have learned local expertise throughout our 17 years here. Now, the combination of these two qualities makes us successful.</p><h4>M&amp;M has a broad international reach. What is the core focus of the company's activities in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our core business is the transportation of cargo. We operate with all automotive transport methods, offering air, rail, and sea freight. Of course, we are a land-locked country, so that is why sea freight is always in combination with another mode of transport: mostly rail or truck. We provide a full package of services to our customers. We also have good experience in serving the project business, and this involves the special transportation of extra-large cargo, such as oil rigs.</p><h4>How would you describe the sectors with which you are working most closely?</h4><p>A lot of our customers are now from the non-prime sectors, such as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), mining, and retail, which are growing very quickly. I would say that retail and FMCG have been the fastest growing sectors over the last decade. Of course the mining, and oil and gas sectors represent a good portion of our customer base, and were traditionally our main customers, but now we service a wider range of sectors.</p><div class="quote">“Retail and FMCG have been the fastest growing sectors over the last decade."</div><h4>How will the recently enacted Customs Union affect your operations and the economy in general?</h4><p>Overall, this is a very good initiative. We have already seen the first positive effects of introducing the Customs Union. We see that a lot of customers who had quite limited relations with Russian buyers and producers now have more relations with Russian companies following the Customs Union. It will only be positive for us, and the economy as a whole.</p><h4>Where would you place your company among the main players in the goods transport sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Of course, we have a number of rivals. The competition is high, but I would say that our business model is different. We are very successful in this market because we have a different approach. We are not here just to make money. We are here to give our competence and expertise to local customers in Kazakhstan, to support their business, to consult them on how they can perform better, and optimize their expenses. This is what makes us different. We appreciate true partnership with our customers, not just based on finances. We try to help them be successful in the business they are pursuing. That is why I cannot say we are number one or number 10. We are completely different, and this is our core competence. For instance, we offer customs services. Due to changes in our customs legislation, only a number of companies were able to reapprove the license for customs brokerage services, and we are one of them, and so this is also part of our business. We see the possibility of expanding to other regions of Kazakhstan as well. There are a lot of opportunities. We are thinking about investing into different regions in Kazakhstan where we might establish warehouses in the future.</p><h4>What issues do you feel need to be addressed to improve the efficiency of freight transport into and out of Kazakhstan?</h4><p>There is a lot to be done to improve legislation and infrastructure. We used to struggle with HR challenges, but those issues are being overcome. We also contribute to this because it's a commitment of our company to educate our staff. We have a budget and plan for education. We not only rely on the resources already available in the market, but we strive to maintain a team of growing professionals within our organization. Additionally, we are an ISO-certified company. It's very important to pay attention to high standards of service, and this is where the ISO system helps.</p><h4>How do you insure your transactions?</h4><p>All of our liabilities are covered by an insurance company that is a part of TransInvest Holding—the owner of M&amp;M group worldwide. If a mistake is made, our customers can be sure that these mistakes will be covered by our insurance company. We are the only company in Kazakhstan using this model.</p><h4>How does M&amp;M's experience in Kazakhstan reflect the changing nature of international trade and investment?</h4><p>Traditionally, we are more focused on international transportation than the domestic business. Throughout the years, Kazakhstan has gained a lot of trade partners besides its traditional ones, like Germany, Russia, and China. As the economy grows, we develop our knowledge base, and our portfolio grows. We now have the experience and ability to transport goods to any place in the world. It only depends on how much cargo Kazakhstani companies will purchase from those countries.</p><h4>Have you worked on any government projects in addition to your work in the private sector?</h4><p>Yes, we also participate in government-sponsored projects. We're registered as a sub-contractor for governmental supply. We are not limited to commercial organizations, but work with governmental organizations as well. Also, we have an office in Afghanistan where we are working quite actively. We supply goods from Kazakhstan to Afghanistan for its government and other authorities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did DHL begin its operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>DHL began its operations in Kazakhstan in 1991, and its first customer was the National Bank of Kazakhstan. DHL entered the USSR in 1984, and was one of the only foreign companies doing business there at the time. DHL mostly serviced embassies based in Moscow. Once the USSR split up, DHL moved into the various countries that had gained independence.</p><h4>What are your core activities here?</h4><p>Our key activity is the movement of time-sensitive material in, out of, and across the country. We primarily transport our shipments by air. We naturally do a lot of business with companies in the oil and gas industry, but lately there has been more demand from consumer product companies that need more day-definite-type services. Therefore, instead of getting shipments to their destinations the next day at 9.00 am, we can deliver orders of, say, 1,000 kilograms to Astana from Almaty in three days.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the quality of Kazakhstan's internal transport infrastructure?</h4><p>The air network isn't very well developed, although it's our main mode of delivery. We also use the land network; however, it is not as practical as air due to the size of the country. Domestically, we work closely with Air Astana. The government has been investing greatly in the transportation sector, and we hope that will continue. Regardless of the challenges or difficulties, DHL always aims to deliver shipments on the due date without exception.</p><div class="quote">“Our customers are starting to ship more, and that suggests things are picking up."</div><h4>Where is DHL most active in the country?</h4><p>Our center of operations is in Almaty and it has the biggest share of trade volume. It has the largest population and most businesses still have their main offices in the city. That being said, we are seeing a shift to the capital Astana. The percentage share of Almaty is decreasing year by year, while Astana is increasing its share in our overall business. We also deal with the Caspian region a lot, and our clients there are pretty much exclusively from the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>Who are your main clients?</h4><p>We concentrate mostly on corporate customers, although we also have many retail customers. We primarily focus on the business-to-business sector, although we also do business-to-consumer or consumer-to-consumer trade, which invariably goes through our retail outlets.</p><h4>What are the challenges for DHL in the domestic market?</h4><p>The main challenge for us is probably the low barriers of entry in the domestic market. All that is required to make a delivery is a man and a truck, and therefore we have to compete with cheaper alternatives, but of course the advantage we offer is that we guarantee delivery and boast a worldwide network with credentials of an impeccable quality. Overall, in terms of delivery speed, our research shows that DHL is about a day quicker than 60% of its competition.</p><h4>What about warehouse services?</h4><p>In Kazakhstan we have no need for the kind of massive 10,000 sqm facilities that DHL operates in other countries; however, we do offer spare part distribution centers that are focused on carrying emergency items, which means items that must be delivered within 24 hours. Let's say a server goes down in Atyrau. Rather than delivering the goods from Astana to Atyrau, we hold a small inventory of backups for parts that need to be replaced frequently and locally. That way we can facilitate a 2- to 4-hour delivery. This is specifically focused on important, high-value, high-obsolescence goods. Needless to say, it's our customers that supply those goods.</p><h4>What measures could be implemented to increase and improve freight transport into and out of Kazakhstan?</h4><p>There are measures being taken to improve access to western Kazakhstan, which is very important. Also, the government is investing a lot in the transportation sector, in the rail, road, and air network. That is crucial, especially in our line of business. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan has improved steadily, and the country's logistics infrastructure today is incomparable to even 10 years ago.</p><h4>Now that the economic situation is improving, what trends have you observed in the Kazakhstani economy over the last year?</h4><p>In terms of our own business, our improved performance in terms of volume of shipments reflects the growth of GDP over the last year. There's a direct correlation. There is buoyancy in the oil and gas sector, as well as a general improvement across other sectors, including banking and finance, consumer products, and so forth. Consumer companies might still be slightly pessimistic in 2011, but the trend is on the up. Our customers are starting to ship more, and that suggests things are picking up.</p><h4>What are your strategic goals in 2011?</h4><p>DHL needs to start investing in its infrastructure. That means additional flights between cities, and buildings with greater storage capacity to support our operations. We will be opening a new facility in Astana in 2011, for example, and we also have another project planned for Aktau. We also want to focus on advertising and promotion, training, and making sure we can provide salary increases for our staff. We're going to be bringing in training methods from countries such as Turkey, where our colleagues are very innovative. So in short, we want to be faster, we want even better trained people, and we want to have bigger facilities to process shipments. All of that will be of the greatest benefit to our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the strengths of Kazpost and its extensive postal savings network?<br></h4><p>Our company operates one of the biggest postal-savings systems in the CIS region. We have developed postal financial services and banking services. We have over 3,000 postal offices and approximately 21,000 employees. One of the good things about our company is that our post offices are located in villages all over the country. In this way, we have introduced village populations to our banking system and the postal system. Kazpost's postal savings system is a highly developed income system, and this was agreed upon by the European Postal Union (EPU), located in Switzerland. It was later put forward by the EPU that Kazpost would be an example for other countries in the region.</p><h4>How has Kazpost overcome the challenging nature of Kazakhstan's vast geography?</h4><p>First of all, we are looking to develop our postal offices throughout each territory, and in the future we will locate our branches in relation to population. As a postal company in the CIS region, we have established modern equipment for all our postal items. We are also starting the development of an advanced postal sorting system. We have three postal sorting system centers in Almaty, Astana, and Atyrau. They cover the south, north, and west. This system allows us to utilize time efficiently. Like other big companies, we use all forms of transportation, including air, rail, and road freight in all territories.</p><h4>Which products have the highest demand?</h4><p>We have generated effective ways to send post cards, parcels, letters, and items, and these services are very popular. We also perform money transfers and pay pensions and salaries. These services are also very much in demand.</p><h4>Do you see competition from express delivery service companies?</h4><p>Yes, but we have also developed our own express services in cooperation with the EPU. The EPU has a very well developed express mail service (EMS) system, and it is this system that we use here in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How are you competing with the larger banks in terms of your financial services?</h4><p>In each region we are working to open banks in developed urban areas. In the villages we almost have free rein as a near monopoly. The second level banks do not function well in more rural areas, and for that reason our strength lies in those rural areas. The system performs well and is very profitable. The number of offices we have across the country is also a distinct advantage.</p><h4>What innovative solutions do you hope to apply in the future to improve your services?</h4><p>We plan to use e-commerce and mobile phone banking systems. In addition, we would like to adapt a hybrid mail solution, whereby digital data is later transformed into a physical document at distributed print centers. We also aim to implement a superior postal card program. These developments are all aimed at improving our financial services.</p><h4>How are you preparing Kazpost for a possible IPO?</h4><p>An IPO is a great way to develop our company. In that vein, we are working to develop our responsibilities and improve the quality of our services through investment from the banking and financial system, and through innovation programs. We realize that we have responsibilities to our clients in villages and big cities, and such social responsibility is a facet of our organization. We try to develop our income while maximizing our expenditures, and develop our business system before we launch our social IPO.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Wirtgen has been in Kazakhstan since 1998. How has your business evolved over the past 13 years?</h4><p>We entered Kazakhstan with a representative office in 1998. In 2001 we created Wirtgen Kazakhstan as a fully fledged company. The brand was already known among specialists, as the first road-construction machines came to Kazakhstan in the 1970s, but of course the majority of the machines were supplied at the end of the 1990s. At first it was difficult for us to grow our business, as there was a crisis, but now we are the market leader. The company produces road construction machinery and surface mining machines. The company is composed of four groups: Wirtgen, Vogele pavers, Hamm rollers, and Kleemann crushers. Vogele was established in the 19th century, but Wirtgen acquired the brand in 1994. We bought Hamm out in 1999, and Kleemann was bought five years ago. Now all the companies belong to the Wirtgen family. Currently, in Kazakhstan, we sell around 80-85% of the Wirtgen portfolio. Wirtgen machinery is first in the market globally and locally. We have 75% of the world road construction market. In Kazakhstan we dominate with a 90-95% share of the milling machinery sector. All of our machinery comes from Germany. Because the Kazakhstani market is small, we know our clients very well and our clients know us very well. We have our stocks and service facilities here in Almaty, and our branch office in Astana. All of our clients are private companies, working as contractors for government projects. Wirtgen machines are currently being used on the Western Europe-Western China road project.</p><h4>How has Kazakhstan's transport infrastructure developed since 1991?</h4><p>In Soviet times Kazakhstan's infrastructure was well developed, but due to the financial crisis in the 1990s it fell into disrepair. Since the 2000s, however, the situation has been improving. The government is working to develop the sector and has built good relations with contractors. In this regard, we face no legal challenges. Investments in road infrastructure could be higher, and we are hoping to see an increased focus on the sector in the coming years.</p><h4>What is the cause of the lack of investment in the road network?</h4><p>The country's economy is not developed enough. Kazakhstan occupies a huge territory and its population is thinly spread. Due to this small population it is not possible to maintain the road network given current GDP levels. The main financing comes from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Asian Development Bank. It is not the right time for the private sector to invest in the road network, as there is not enough traffic, meaning profits are low. The government is constructing a new toll road between Astana and Borovoe, and the ministry and government has plans to establish concession agreements.</p><div class="quote">“Wirtgen machines are currently being used on the Western Europe-Western China road project."</div><h4>To what extent do developments in Kazakhstan's road network focus on increasing international connectivity?</h4><p>The main mode of transport in Kazakhstan is road. The government, in that respect, focuses on the problem of roads, the main issues being in transit and domestic roads. The road network is developed to a satisfactory level, but the quality of the roads needs to be improved. New construction is limited, and 90% of the Western Europe-Western China route follows existing routes, which need to be restored and widened.</p><h4>What are the busiest routes in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The busiest route is between China and Astana. The development of Atyrau and Aktau as oil capitals has not affected the road network as their means of transport is mainly pipelines and railways. In Soviet times the busiest route was from Almaty to Tashkent, and we are just getting close to the kind of volumes seen during those times. This increase is due to both passenger traffic and the transportation of goods. There are problems at customs, and if we solve these problems the volume can grow by 30%.</p><h4>What innovations are you introducing to maintain your market share?</h4><p>Our company is innovative in the sense that we use recycled material in manufacturing. It is the first company to do so. This is new technology. Not only does it bring down production costs, but it eases environmental concerns.</p><h4>What about your operations in mining?</h4><p>Our share in mining is relatively small for the moment, because the number of machines we offer are small. Yet, we have good relationships with the big companies. Our technology is new and our focus is on the extraction of resources without using explosives. We see room for growth in terms of our market share, yet the mining sector is very conservative and it is difficult to persuade top managers to change their technology. We are, however, working to change habits by offering our Wirtgen surface miners and Kleemann crushing and screening plants. We have recently delivered the biggest mobile crusher in our portfolio—a Kleemann—to Kazakh Aluminum.</p><h4>Several underground resources have been brought into high production in Kazakhstan, such as uranium and phosphate. Which resources do you think require more investment?</h4><p>All of the main international players are present in Kazakhstan, yet I see opportunity in the extraction of rare earth materials such as wolfram.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for 2011 and beyond?</h4><p>Our business follows a cyclical pattern of five years. We are now on the up. The last crisis didn't affect our business too much; we lost only 3-4% turnover, but due to increased government spending we were able to operate effectively and avoid any severe negative impacts. We are now at the top of the cycle, and are expecting to grow even more over the next three or four years. The Kazakhstani transportation sector will also continue its upward trend, yet it depends somewhat on the overall economy and commodity prices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Globalink is one of the major players in the transport sector in Kazakhstan. As a foreign investor, why did you choose Kazakhstan and the transport sector?<br></h4><p>We have been in the transport business for two generations—it is a family business. I am the one who decided to transform the business from being a traditional road and short sea transportation company into a multi-modal transportation and logistics management business. The transport and logistics business has evolved; you do not need to have trucks, planes, and trains to be involved in transport. You can be a service provider as an asset light company, and you can be a logistics provider creating supply chain solutions based on a combination of HR and IT. I have started evolving the family business from being a hardcore, asset heavy carriage business to an asset-light, HR- and technology-driven transport and logistics management business. I chose Kazakhstan because its location is exceptionally interesting. Some people look at Kazakhstan and say it is landlocked, and that because of this there is lack of opportunities. Kazakhstan does not have a coastline, but if you look at its location it is an ideal fit between East and West. You look at Kazakhstan and its border with China, and on the other hand there is Russia, which is ultimately connected to the Baltic Sea and Europe. Kazakhstan is also located on the Silk Road, which is a buzzword among all Central Asian states nowadays. Kazakhstan also has the natural resources. When I came here I was only 24 years old and I saw the opportunity to establish the link between East and West. Reviving the Silk Road became a dream. Since 1992 I have been working on developing Globalink, in 1993 I came to settle here, and in 1994 Globalink was officially registered.</p><h4>You were one of the first newcomers to the country. How does your company's growth reflect the growth of Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>I think our business has grown in parallel with Kazakhstan's economy. You have to be mentally and physically prepared to accept the realities of an emerging country while doing business here, and rather than complaining about certain aspects, you have to do something to improve that reality. That is what exactly Globalink did. We came here in 1992, and we accepted the realities on the ground. I did a lot of consulting and research work, and was busy traveling in the region to each and every country connected to Kazakhstan. I visited my customers, and I visited those companies that were not present in the region. Once we felt that we were 100% sure that we could deliver a service, only then did we register a legal entity and start offering services. Since we opened our doors in 1992 we have satisfied all our clients' demands because we have been well prepared for the realities of the country, especially considering it is an emerging and challenging market where you have to deal with a unique culture, political scene, economy, and post-Soviet infrastructure. I am proud of the fact that Globalink is the first Kazakhstani company in the service sector that has spread to 22 countries worldwide in the past 17 years, offering vertically integrated transport and logistics solutions. We have also developed a Global Network that extends across 65 countries to cover 90% of the world economy. This means we have people on the ground in every major market across the globe ready to support our customers. Our growth and increasing global connectivity is a reflection of Kazakhstan's growth and increasing connectivity.</p><h4>What role can the logistics sector play in the diversification of Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan borders China, and it would be very tough challenge to develop mass manufacturing here. However, if you look at Kazakhstan's location a lot of people consider it to be a disadvantage—I disagree. We have an abundance of natural resources that we have to convert into finished products, and we have to ensure our products reach world markets at a reasonable cost.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We are also constantly on the look out for new distribution channels enabling us to reach other segments of the population.</p><h4>What products are most in demand?</h4><p>Without any doubt, despite the absence of mandatory civil liability insurance for third-party damage as a result of traffic accidents, car insurance continues to be the most requested product in the market. However, we consider that when civil liability insurance for third-party damage becomes mandatory, the market share of this insurance line will increase and will contribute to increasing the financing culture of the population. Likewise, industrial risk insurance is requested by major corporations. Other popular policies include health and, of course, micro-insurance; however, there is still a lot to be done in that regard.</p><div class="quote">“We work to encourage ongoing innovation in order to offer the best insurance products with a great variety of coverage."</div><h4>What are your strategies to increasing the presence of MAPFRE products in the market?</h4><p>The first strategy is geographical expansion. MAPFRE has actively worked since the beginning of its operations in Mexico on its geographical expansion project to make its insurance products and services available to most of the population. MAPFRE currently has 400 offices strategically distributed around the country, mainly based on demographic, social, economic, and commercial development criteria. Regarding the permanent innovation of our product lines, we have developed important strategies such as designing and distributing low-cost insurance products—or “micro-insurances"—to promote low-income individuals' access to insurance. Furthermore, we want to introduce standardized basic products aimed at meeting the specific insurance needs of people against death, accidents, diseases, and civil liability in the automotive field. We work to encourage ongoing innovation in order to offer the best insurance products with a great variety of coverage at flexible rates tailored to the individual. We are also looking to expand our distribution channels through the internet, telephone marketing, microfinance companies, and department and self-service stores.</p><h4>What are the challenges in the insurance market?</h4><p>From our point of view, the main challenges that the Mexican insurance sector faces include the limited development of the sector, security issues, which have caused a 72% increase in car theft since 2006, natural disasters, and the implementation of the Solvency II scheme for the Mexican insurance sector, the enforcement of which is foreseen in 2014 based on risk control and the establishment of efficient corporate governance. Other issues include the lack of mandatory insurance covering civil liability for damage caused to third parties, namely injury and damage to property as a result of traffic accidents, the need for comprehensive tax reform, and the necessity to modify labor legislation.</p><h4>What are some of the main changes the insurance market should expect going forward?</h4><p>The main changes the insurance industry will undergo include the introduction of mandatory civil liability insurance for automotive vehicles at a national rather than just a local level, amendments to the Federal Labor Law specifically affecting insurance institutions that consider insurance agents as employees of the companies for which they perform brokerage work without considering that such activity is independent, and the incorporation of a consortium or execution of an agreement with an international body providing stability in times of natural disaster. Furthermore, we foresee a reduction in security issues. There is no doubt whatsoever of the social function that insurance performs in any economy, although the specific effect is greater in developing countries, and the immediate and tangible benefits it offers are more obvious.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Tekfen evolved into one of the major world constructors since it was founded in 1956?</h4><p>Tekfen Construction is the cornerstone of Tekfen Holding. It was founded in 1956 as a consulting firm, and later evolved into a contracting company. Currently, Tekfen Construction is one of Turkey's leading international contractors, with a field of activities ranging from the turnkey construction of motorways, industrial plants, refineries, and petrochemical complexes, to power plants, pipelines, tank farms, satellite towns, and other infrastructure projects. The company provides increasingly sophisticated services with the support of its state-of-the-art steel fabrication plants and sister companies Tekfen Engineering and Tekfen Manufacturing. Since its inception, Tekfen Construction has been substantially involved in Turkey's infrastructure development and contributed significantly to the Turkish economy. To date, Tekfen Construction has completed various civil and industrial projects in countries such as Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Oman, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria, Russia, Germany, and Turkey to the full satisfaction of its clients.</p><h4>Which markets projects currently hold the most potential for Tekfen Construction?</h4><p>Throughout the years, Tekfen Construction has accumulated significant experience in projects requiring advanced technology, with a particular focus on the petrochemical industry. Tekfen Construction has specialized in refineries, pipelines, tank farms, and platform topsides. With this track record, Tekfen Construction became predominantly active in areas producing oil and gas, such as the Caspian Sea region, the Persian Gulf, and North Africa. Tekfen Construction has undertaken projects for global energy companies such as BP, Eni, and large state-owned companies that require the highest professional standards. Tekfen Construction was very active in Iraq for 25 years before the war, and the country offers significant potential now that some stability has been achieved. Tekfen Construction now has the opportunity to re-open its Baghdad office and renew its registration. Currently, Tekfen Construction provides construction management services for BP in the Rumaila oil field. Undoubtedly, Iraq will be the shining star in the Middle East, with a number of new oil and gas projects.</p><div class="quote">“Throughout the years, Tekfen Construction has accumulated significant experience in projects requiring advanced technology."</div><h4>Which type of projects holds the most potential for returns on investment?</h4><p>The kind of projects holding the most potential for Tekfen Construction are sophisticated projects in the petrochemical industry, pipelines, and motorways, where Tekfen Construction is able to provide value-added with higher profit margins. For higher competitiveness and profitability, Tekfen Construction aims towards turnkey engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) projects. We are taking strategic steps in developing the know-how of EPC and are focusing on the proficiency of our human resources, the company's most important asset.</p><h4>What impact has political turmoil across North Africa had on the company?</h4><p>The al-Khufra-Tazerbo Water Conveyance System is a 400-kilometer section of the Great Manmade River Project (GMR). The water system was undertaken as a joint venture with our Turkish partner, TML, in 2006, and reached 70% completion by the time political unrest began in February 2011. The political and social unrest in Libya forced Tekfen Construction to cease all activity and leave the country. Our workforce was pulled out successfully, and we will not re-enter the country until conditions stabilize. The Turkish government has been in constant negotiations with the Libyan authorities in order to secure mutual cooperation, which would emphasize the role of Turkish contractors working in Libya. The total value of unfinished contracting amounts to approximately $17 billion. Tekfen Construction will re-open its branch office and is closely following the opportunities and new developments in Libya. We will resume our activity in the country when the right moment and project come, and hopefully continue our existing project. There are signs that Libya is moving towards a steady political situation and we believe that Libya will reap the benefits of international investment and aid, which in turn will yield opportunities in the construction industry in the near future.</p><h4>What trends can you identify for the sector in the medium term?</h4><p>The contracting/construction sector was hit harder than many other sectors, and several companies in the sector faced severe difficulties in 2009. The precipitous fall in crude oil prices from a high of $145 a barrel in July 2008 to $35 a barrel at the end of 2008 led to a slowdown in infrastructure and housing investments, and adversely impacted investments in the oil and gas industry in many countries. Tekfen Construction was not immune to the decline of economic activity throughout the world. Despite these challenges, Tekfen Construction has signed new business contracts and made additions to existing projects in 2009, and largely overcame the effects of the crisis in 2010 and 2011. In the medium term, we forecast slow and controlled growth in the construction sector, and Tekfen Construction will position itself accordingly. Tekfen Construction has embraced two fundamental principles while doing business. The first is a decisive, cautious, and sustainable growth strategy; the second is concentrating on our areas of specialization. Owing to an outstanding management philosophy, and not focusing on short-term success through a high-risk approach, we have moved forward decisively and steadily, without suffering serious repercussions. Focusing on businesses in which we are experienced has enabled Tekfen Construction's rise to the top of the field and resist economic crises.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has the effect of America Movil on the Ecuadorean market been?</h4><p>Between 2000 and 2011 the mobile telephone penetration rate in Ecuador increased by 104% as a result of enormous investment from companies such as America Movil, and its brand Claro. We have assigned more than $5 billion over the past five years to the development of telecoms in the country. We can proudly say that we have coverage from Yasuni, in the east of the country, to Isabella Island in the Galapagos, which is the furthest point in the west. We have coverage that serves 96% of the population with both voice and data services, and in some areas we are the only service provider available because we have decided not to focus only on the big urban sectors, where there is obvious demand and profitability. Instead we have tried to reach cities with less than 2,000 people, who have sometimes been isolated.</p><h4>What opportunities exist in providing internet services?</h4><p>The internet is a great opportunity for every provider in the country and for the entire of society. We are committed to introducing a new digital society in Ecuador. The indices for internet penetration are low, around 14%. Increasing this figure will not only be positive for business, but also for Ecuadorean society as a whole. The most feasible way to make that happen today is to take the first steps into the digital world through mobile phones. Cellphone coverage is nationwide, and smartphone makers are gaining space and lowering their prices, which allows more people to access the internet who maybe didn't have access before or could only access it through traditional means, such as computers. It will thus be very helpful that public policies align with private policies in order to provide greater benefits to society. If smartphones and certain components are the basis for the growth of usage levels, they should be exempt from certain taxes that stop the growth of the adoption curve—at least in some segments. It's important to have a balance and stimulate the companies that develop non-traditional market segments like ours.</p><div class="quote">“We are openly looking for entrepreneurs in the country and in Latin America that want to develop content."</div><h4>What plans do you have to introduce 4G technology into the country?</h4><p>If we benchmark against South America on the radio electric spectrum, which is the spectrum containing all frequencies that phones, radios, TVs, and so on give off, the average for a Latin American mobile provider is around 55 MHz. In Ecuador the average is 35 MHz. The lower the value, the greater usage of frequency there is in order to provide a service. LTE, which is fourth-generation technology, requires wider broadband, so that newly developed networks can cope with the data transmitted. We have made important efforts, and we've received a good response from the government in terms of upgrading to a wider spectrum, not only for Claro but for the rest of the providers, because that's the way public policies stimulate internet access.</p><h4>Is Conecel looking for partnerships in areas related to content development?</h4><p>We are openly looking for entrepreneurs in the country and in Latin America that want to develop content. There are many positive stories of young people who have lived the “Latin American Dream," and started their own company. This has also created a fertile field for new service providers. We have more than 30 local content providers of all kinds. In some cases they have been able to export their services to other Latin American countries.</p><h4>How significant is Ecuador for America Movil?</h4><p>This question is similar to asking a father which one of his kids he loves the most; he will say that he loves each one the same. Obviously, there are favorable conditions to develop businesses and Ecuador is a country that offers a lot of opportunities. We have always been committed and interested in growing. Ecuador has big importance for America Movil today because we want to offer new services that exist around the world. The penetration of paid TV in Ecuador is very low as well—it's around 12%—and in order to offer paid TV in the country you must go through a cable, which means you have to install cables all over the country, or through satellite. We are negotiating that license to be able to offer Claro like we are already offering it in other countries and to become more present in the basic telecoms sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Kcell developed since its inception in 1998?<br></h4><p>It has been more than 12 years now since the first commercial launch of the GSM-900 standard. President Nazarbayev participated in the official launch ceremony of Kcell's mobile network. We are proud to state that Kcell was the first to give all Kazakhstani people a unique opportunity for integration into the global information network of GSM standard mobile communications. Since then, owing to our dynamic investment approach as well as the support of our shareholders—Europe's fifth largest cellular operator TeliaSonera, and Kazakhtelecom—the national telecommunications infrastructure has become one of the most advanced among the CIS. The development of mobile communication systems has made a significant contribution to the local economy. Based on industrial experts' opinions, the increase in mobile communication penetration resulted in further growth of local GDP from 1% to 1.6%. The current nominal cellular communication penetration within Kazakhstan exceeds 100%. I believe those figures speak for themselves. For the past 12 years Kcell has invested over $1.7 billion into telecoms infrastructure development, thus becoming one of the biggest investors of the non-oil-and-gas sector. By looking at those figures from a different perspective, you can see that in 1999 we launched the operation in Almaty, and acquiring the 10,000th subscriber was a big step for us. As of today, the number of registered subscribers has reached over 9 million. From a technical perspective, we started operations by using a few base stations within one city, and we have more than 5,000 of them all over the country. Our network covers more than 81% of Kazakhstan's populated area, and Kcell operates in 2,621 cities and towns, which comprises 100% coverage of locations with more than 5,000 people and 82% coverage of locations with more than 2,000 people. The plan is to provide mobile communications to all locations with over 1,000 people by 2013. We launched 3G in 2010 to support the OSCE Summit and acted for the 7th Asian Winter Games as the official mobile operator. As of today our 3G network is working in 32 cities built on over 900 base stations.</p><h4>How would you assess Kcell's performance and vision as a pioneer in innovative technologies?</h4><p>Kcell aims to provide world-class services, and we pursue this objective with confidence through improvements in our tariff policy and our quality of service at all levels. Kcell has always been a trendsetter and we are leading the development of the telecommunications market in Kazakhstan. We shall continue doing this in 2011, introducing new 3G services, which not only meet but also form market demands. For instance, we plan to provide universal services so that telephones can serve as modems, bankcards, and electronic door keys. We're also ready to launch 4G/long term evolution (LTE). I'm sure this is a good prospective for the further development of the Kazakhstani telecommunications market, which we hope will be realized in the near future with the most active participation of our company.</p><h4>How can the telecommunications sector contribute to the development of the non-prime economy?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has a challenging strategy to become one of the most competitive economies. Penetration and the availability of mobile telecoms services as well as the speed of mobile broadband data traffic in mobile networks are the key factors in rating the most competitive economies. This is an obvious fact that drives economic development, too. However, Kazakhstan's economy is too dependent on raw materials and oil and gas production, and of course the price levels of these substances on the international markets.</p><div class="quote">“Kcell has always been a trendsetter and we are leading the development of the telecommunications market in Kazakhstan."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wimax-power]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the core aims when founding Alem Communications?</h4><p>Alem Communications was established in 2008, during the period of the active introduction of cable television and the appearance of new telecommunications operators. The following year the company had made the first significant step in its strategy, acquiring several large and small telecommunications assets, which have been successfully integrated. Under scaled-back expansion, the company opened offices in 12 major cities in Kazakhstan. By now the portfolio of services has been fully formed, including television, internet, and communications with substantial subscriber bases. Using the internal potential and expertise of its specialists, the company has gained weight and authority, both in the mass and the corporate market segments. The next stage in the development of the company was the development of the wireless internet market based on WiMAX technology. Using the potential of its subsidiaries, Alem Communications launched WiMAX services in five cities, including Almaty and the capital Astana. A cooperation agreement with Intel was also announced and internet access was secured by signing a contract with Kazakhtelecom, the biggest player in the telecommunications market. All of these strategic efforts have allowed Alem Communications to expand the territory of its presence up to 12 cities and prepare a solid base for further development.</p><h4>What are the secrets behind Alem's instant success?</h4><p>We have an experienced management team. Since we had the business plan approved, we've had everything go according to plan, which is not the case for many players in the market. We'll be focusing on increasing our presence, and working to supply all our customers with the necessary bandwidth and services. Currently, the main source of income for the company is a package of cable TV services as it is the principal activity of a majority of the acquired operators. But in the very near future we plan to aggressively expand the coverage area of mobile internet access through WiMAX technology. Growth rates in this area are impressive even now. We made our first commercial launch of WiMAX in the city of Almaty in March 2010, followed by commercial launches in Aktau, Astana, Karaganda, and Taraz. We are confident that we can sustain high rates of network construction over 2011. In 2011 we're going to launch voice-over WiMAX services as well. We are also considering a migration to Long-Term Evolution (LTE), as it seems to be a developing trend in the world. The more mobile internet is demanded, the more we focus on the development of WiMAX technology with the possibility of migrating to LTE standards. For our company, WiMAX technology is not only a business tool, but also an experience of cooperation with large partners such as Samsung and ZTE. With their extensive experience in wireless network services, these partners give us invaluable support on the launch and maintenance of high-tech equipment.</p><h4>What are the specifics of your strategy?</h4><p>Despite its vast area, the mobile market in Kazakhstan is considered to be sufficiently developed. Until recently it was limited to voice network services, but nowadays broadband access development is taking place in both the cable and mobile market segments, including the 3G network. Our strategy is pro-active, with the expectation of an increasingly growing consumer need for fast and affordable mobile internet services. Users have been accustomed to searching for information and online entertainment via internet users recurrently, we expect demand for mobile internet: in hotels, home, cafes, railway stations, and so on.</p><div class="quote">“Samsung brought state-of-the-art technology to our company, along with a deep knowledge of the industry."</div><h4>What is the significance of your partnership with Samsung and ZTE?</h4><p>Samsung brought state-of-the-art technology to our company, along with a deep knowledge of the industry. It has helped us a lot during our startup operations as we had very little experience. In the mobile sector you must always have at least two partners. This is why we chose ZTE as our second partner to balance our development. ZTE is also a recognized expert in WiMAX formats, and this helps us to compare what different companies are doing. It gives us some assurance that we're moving in the right direction, and helps us make sound decisions. We're benefiting from both of our partners.</p><h4>What is your outlook beyond 2011 for the sector and for Alem Communications?</h4><p>Such brands as Kazakhtelecom, Beeline, and Kcell remain the largest players in the market, yet this landscape will change as we continue on our growth course. The main trend of the current year and of the future is the increasing role of broadband internet access and integrated offers.</p><p>Alem Communications will maintain its position of continuously developing our services and coverage area, and considering and analyzing the behavior of large players and changes in the structure of small players. In general, Alem Communications has a clear vision of the market, and implements its mission through its partners and with the use of its internal capacity.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Beeline came to the Kazakhstani telecoms market in the 2004. After six years in Kazakhstan, what position does your company hold in the market?<br></h4><p>We are currently a close second in the market. We have a substantial subscriber base, and we are the leading operator in five regions out of 14 in Kazakhstan. Our development has been swift, and we are happy with the growth we have seen.</p><h4>What has set Beeline apart from its competition in the short time it has been active in the country?</h4><p>We are a unique universal player in the Kazakhstani market, present in almost all telecoms segments, with very few exceptions. We are a cellular operator, and a broadband internet provider with business as well as family subscribers. We are fiber-optic operators, having already built over 5,000 kilometers of fiber-optical lines that connect key cities in Kazakhstan. We are also increasingly offering satellite and some more specific telecoms services. None of our competitors can really boast of such a diverse range of services.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the telecommunications sector's climate over the last three years?</h4><p>The climate has been solid. The industry has managed to grow at a much faster rate than GDP over the last couple of years. In 2009 GDP growth was approximately 1%, and telecoms sector growth was around 8%. This was followed by 10% growth in the telecoms sector in 2010, beating all GDP estimates dramatically. Such figures are a good indicator of the positive climate for the telecoms industry.</p><div class="quote">“Kazakhstan is still relatively underdeveloped in terms of the use of internet in business. This is a big opportunity for us."</div><h4>To what extent has the acquisition of smaller competitors been in your growth strategy?</h4><p>It has traditionally been a part of our growth strategy, as it is quite difficult to survive in a market with such strong players present. Currently, we are dominating the sector, and we have some successful subsidiary companies that we have acquired in recent years. We shall continue to look for potential opportunities if the target is attractive; however, that kind of activity will be somewhat limited from now on.</p><h4>Do you believe the mobile sector has reached saturation point, and how will the market evolve from here?</h4><p>The penetration rate of the mobile sector in SIM cards is around 123%. This doesn't offer many opportunities for newcomers. It does, however, allow key players to offer a broad range of services to subscribers. Kazakhstan is still relatively underdeveloped in terms of the use of internet in business. This is a big opportunity for us. In this regard, we hope to meet our targets by continuing the implementation of new standards such as 3G.</p><h4>What position do you currently occupy in the 3G market, and what potential does the platform have?</h4><p>We have been very aggressive in our internet rollout program. We were the first operator in Kazakhstan to offer nationwide 3G. We are already operating in 32 cities, and we built this network in about one month. We see great opportunity, especially for people with a high profile of usage. We need to cover their demands. They are tired of slow internet, and so the pressure is on to provide the same levels of service seen in other countries. There is also a second option that we need to understand—internet access isn't prevalent in small cities. Business-wise, it's not practical to build an optical network for family homes spaced far apart. The 3G service offers more remote locations the right speed and the right quality of internet, and a very simple and accessible way to connect to the worldwide network.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of innovation for Samsung?</h4><p>Innovation is vital for us. It has been noted even by our top management that, even if a product leads the market, it can disappear without constant creative innovation. This can be highlighted by the decline of one of the hugely successful Japanese brands 10 years ago, which has now lost its position due to a lack of investment in innovation. Samsung approaches innovation in three ways. The first is the product, the second is the process, and the third is personnel. Production innovation is very important. Without technical innovation we cannot survive, because we are an IT company. We invest a huge amount of money in this base area. We also invest in process innovation, such as supply chain management. We need to optimize to operate efficiently. The third way for innovation is personnel. We create innovation in this respect through advanced training methods and smart job placements.</p><h4>To what extent is Kazakhstan a hub for Samsung in the region?</h4><p>I am personally responsible for Samsung Electronics in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Mongolia. The electronic products we provide include TVs, AV products, cameras, home appliances, PCs, printers, and monitors. In that respect, Kazakhstan is a significant hub for us in the region. Kazakhstan is the most important and fastest growing country in Central Asia. Other Central Asian countries try to be oriented on Kazakhstani market trends. I think that is the most significant point. Samsung believes that Kazakhstani consumers are very smart, and diversified from those after premium products to more price-orientated consumers. For Samsung, this is somewhat of a test market. We often launch products here first as the country is not a huge market, yet consumer demands are sophisticated.</p><h4>What products have the highest demand, and how is Samsung positioned amongst its competitors?</h4><p>The overall top-selling products are mid-range products, and we have dropped some of our cheapest products. For TVs, our market share is around 50%, and we dominate the market in high-end HD and 3D televisions. For mobile phones we are in second position, though are aiming to be number one. This can be achieved through a diverse range of products, and this is why we are focusing on smart phones and tablet PCs, for which other brands do not have to the same extent as we do. We are in the number one position for home appliances, except for microwave ovens. In IT products we are number one for monitors, number two for printers, and number three for notebook PCs, with plans to become number one, as our notebook PC business only started up in 2010. Our market share is about 20% already. That means that we are really confident in our aim to be number one very soon.</p><div class="quote">“The electronic products we provide include TVs, AV products, cameras, home appliances, PCs, printers, and monitors."</div><h4>What are your strategic targets for Samsung in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>I want Samsung to be strong and smart. Using smart products, customers can be smart. That is my first target and vision. We have even launched a vacuum cleaner that cleans by itself like a robot. My second target is to make Samsung a concrete number one in all areas.</p><h4>How has Samsung developed its customer services infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>One of Samsung's strong points is service. Every year we formulate the Samsung Customer Service Satisfaction Index, and figures show that we rate highly in terms of customer satisfaction in relation to our competitors. In Kazakhstan, we have more than 100 service centers—even in small cities, which our competitors can only dream of. Our policy is to establish a service center in any city that has a population of more than 100,000. We have a huge service network. We always deliver spare parts very quickly, sometimes by airplane. Within three days, 95% of spare parts are delivered to customers. We solve our problems very quickly. We don't outsource these services, and I think that is why our market share is increasing so rapidly.</p><h4>How has ICT infrastructure developed in Kazakhstan in tandem with the increasing sophistication of products on the market?</h4><p>Data traffic is increasing because of smart phones, tablet PCs, and even with our smart TV. This means that the government has had to begin establishing the necessary infrastructure—the lack of which would have severely damaged Kazakhstan's competitiveness. Therefore, customers can finally enjoy well-developed infrastructure. In that respect we understand the importance of Samsung in the country, and strive to build our brand in a socially responsible way.</p><h4>Have you had any support from the government for your products?</h4><p>The Kazakhstani government is very interested in devices. Before we launched the Galaxy Tab, the government already had interest in Tablet PCs. However, officials find the Galaxy Tab more interesting than other tablet PCs, because it has Kazakh language support. They recognize that it is a useful tool for individuals and institutions in Kazakhstan. We have also recently found out that the government has the idea to use the Galaxy Tab in schools and universities, and this is a key aim of Samsung; to get the Galaxy Tab recognized as an educational tool, too. It can be superb for learning languages, mathematics, and even how to draw. We have also established service centers to provide customer support for this product.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Kazakhstani press evolved over the last 20 years?<br></h4><p>After Kazakhstan gained independence, the domestic media sector has become freer. We can say that those were the most revolutionary years for Kazakhstani journalism. Many media organs were united in holding companies, creating a competitive market environment with a lessened role for the state. Furthermore, many media outlets have received long-awaited freedom. There were opposition newspapers, television, and radio stations. The sector began to generate income through marketing and advertising. This period was critical for the country. Each media outlet needed to find its niche, and to gather feedback from consumers, readers, viewers, and listeners. If we talk only about the periodical press, we can safely say that this period saw the birth of many successful magazines and newspapers.<br></p><p>In 2007 came the first wave of the crisis, which was reflected across the media industry. Many channels, newspapers, magazines, and radio stations sadly closed. It was tough to get advertising as potential advertisers were facing financial difficulties. Many media holdings then went through downsizing. The crisis also affected our company. At that time, we abandoned the English-language version of The Kazakhstan Monitor, a glossy magazine, because production costs were too high. This period was a good lesson for many media outlets as it pushed us to expand our online offerings, and become less costly and more accessible. We have also started to actively develop an online version Kapital, at www.kapital.kz. It is still in its infant stages, but the staff updates economic and financial news daily.</p><h4>How has Kapital grown as a national newspaper since its establishment?</h4><p>Kapital was first published in April 2005, with a strong team of not only journalists, but also designers. There are a lot of competitors in the business media market, hence we needed to find and conquer our niche. We had to become the only weekly newspaper read by VIPs and managers. That is, there was a need to do something unique, interesting, and credible for the readers. In that regard, I think we succeeded. This is our seventh year in the market, and even if we are not the first, we are counted among the top three weekly business newspapers. To highlight our success, it is sometimes not possible to find Kapital on the newsstand due to strong demand. The format of the newspaper, like its trademark green color, marks us out. Prior to us, no publication had used green as a major print color, which really makes us stand out. Another distinctive feature is the cartoons we use on our front page—sometimes a cartoon can replace words and it works just fine.</p><div class="quote">“Recently, the Ministry of Communications and Information in cooperation with a major national internet provider began to actively connect the most remote corners of the country to the internet."</div><h4></h4><h4>What is Kapital's mission in the domestic media?</h4><p>Over the years we have found our main value is the trust of our readers and popularity. Our readers trust us, they build a business with us and make calls on the stock exchange. I think this really is the result of our work. We receive many letters of appreciation and training invitations. It seems to me—most importantly—they are all reflections of our readers' trust.</p><h4>How would you describe your experience as the Editor-in-Chief of Kapital? What is your strategy to carry your newspaper forward with respect to the quality and scope of the news services you provide?</h4><p>Currently we are faced with a unique situation. The media sector, as I have said, is in a difficult situation. However, as the Chinese proverb goes, crises present not only challenges, but also opportunities. Today, the media is presented with great opportunities, because in general the crisis has come and gone. However, the future is impossible without good rebirth, and tomorrow it will be very difficult to do business under the old standards. Today, the market begins to grow, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. And to stay stagnant is just not possible. If we talk about quality, the days when people learned the news from newspapers are long gone. Now news is much easier to learn from the internet and news agencies. Newspapers in the world today must sell an interesting story. It should sell not only facts, but also disclose trends to the reader. Only then can we be helpful to our readers, and in this we see our future.</p><h4>What changes have you observed in Kazakhstani readers' interests and their means of access to information over the past years?</h4><p>In years past, Kazakhstan had high levels of technophobia. Recently, the Ministry of Communications and Information in cooperation with a major national internet provider began to actively connect the most remote corners of the country to the internet. The future is online. All members of the mainstream media should understand how the market will evolve. The essence of journalism is to give readers accurate information as quickly as possible, or to provide readers with interesting stories.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the media industry in 2011 and beyond?</h4><p>All media outlets are directly dependent on the advertising activities of industrial and service enterprises. If the global economy avoids catastrophic upheavals, the media market in this state will continue to successfully develop. Of course, now the media is gradually going online, and this trend will certainly continue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Kazakhstan's energy scene changed during your time with Honeywell in the country?</h4><p>I have been working exclusively for Honeywell since I finished university. I have worked in many places, including around the Middle East and the US. Kazakhstan is an interesting place. GDP has grown 13 fold over the last 10 years, which is rather unique. There is a big difference between how cities like Atyrau look now compared to 1999. Astana is also a huge achievement—I have never seen a country develop such a city in so short a time. I have also never seen so many big and small changes in the business environment.</p><h4>In which areas have your operations centered?</h4><p>We started with oil and gas, and, because of Kazakhstan's focus on this area, oil and gas is still the biggest part of our operation. However, Honeywell is quite a diversified company. We have thousands of industry solutions, from thermostats to aviation and avionics and much more.</p><div class="quote">“We can easy save 20%-30% on anything that is consuming energy if we apply modern technologies."</div><h4>How are your relations with the smaller producers and how do you see their role in the oil sector?</h4><p>In the market it is accurate to talk about segmentation. There is a big market with major players like KMG and Chevron, and lately Chinese companies coming into the market. There is another group of small- and medium-sized customers that have different buying behavior, different requirements, and different budgets. We see quite a lot of potential in this market because, while they are not that big, there are a lot of them. If you had asked me about this 10 years ago, I would have said that these companies were not ready to invest in this kind of modern technology and automation. Previously, their focus was just on producing small amounts of oil, but now I see a considerable change. They have started to understand that it is not just a matter of producing oil, but that you need to consider other things such as the cost of production, efficiency, and safety.</p><h4>How do you see activity in the non-extractive industries?</h4><p>We are not just involved in the oil and gas business. Now we are also involved in residential business, in partnership with construction companies. Over the last few years we have seen good growth here. We are working with alternative energy sources, such as green energy. I am particularly trying to push a new product, a home wind generator. It is a unique product with about 52 worldwide patents. It has no gear box, and it is very cheap and easy to maintain. It is a big step forward because each generator at a big wind farm costs about $500,000 to $1 million, but this home generator only costs $10,000. There is a lot of potential for these individual generators, and we are working on how to make them widely available. There are a lot of small villages where they could help. They could also be installed on the top of commercial buildings.</p><h4>What is Honeywell's take on renewable energy generation in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We can easy save 20%-30% on anything that is consuming energy if we apply modern technologies to optimize and control consumption and distribution. Of course, it is easier with Western businesses in Europe and the US. Here, you need to convince people a bit more. Now, we are starting to propose performance contracts to customers so that instead of paying for the solution, they just pay us a percentage of the amount they save. They then start to trust the concept. And, finally, on January 13, 2012 the President has signed into law new energy efficiency legislation. If there is no legislation to support energy saving it is hard to get anything done. I believe there will be big changes after this law because it spells out what should be done. We are taking baby steps. Generally, if someone feels hot, they open a window. Something as simple as a $20 thermostat could save energy and money. Of course, large industrial operations are more complex. There is a lot of software, a lot of advanced solutions, and a lot of revision to be done at plants.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bancomer had 12 million customers in 2005, and at present the group has almost 18 million. How has your product portfolio evolved, and what has been the main focus of your growth strategy over the last five years?</h4><p>I think technology is very relevant to our commercial strategy. Banking today is very different from how it was 15 years ago. It has changed dramatically. In that sense, the way we grow our customer base has also changed. First we talk about “banking the unbanked." Mexico is a country that is growing very fast in terms of access to credit and banking services. We have adapted different solutions for our customers. The key to this is the mobile telephone, and we have been very successful in launching a new program where customers do not need to go to a branch. They can open an account anywhere—it is very easy. The number of the account is the same as their telephone number. This is just an example, but we are using technology a lot, and the opportunity that we have today, to link banking infrastructure with merchants that act as correspondent banks, allows basic transactions to be done outside of a branch. For example, our 15-year partnership with Wal-Mart allows us to issue private label credit cards. It is very challenging, because we issue many cards per year. We need to do it in a way that is profitable for very low-income customers. On the business side, we have been testing different solutions, but now we are able to issue a program called the “MicroNegocios card." It is a credit card for the working capital of very small companies. The difference is that the average loan amount is $3,000. We are really talking about very small companies, or self-employed individuals, with one or two employees only. These are the kinds of things we've been doing in the past few years that have allowed us to double our customer base in a very short period.</p><h4>What is the current position of Bancomer in the different segments of the Mexican market, and in which sector of the economy is Bancomer most active in terms of credit supply?</h4><p>We are very active in every sector, because we are a universal bank. We have a very significant market share, maybe 25%-30% of many markets, so what is important for us is to break up Bancomer into many different representations, according to the types of customers in different distribution channels, using different marketing and sales forces. Credit to small businesses grew 21% in 2011 compared to 2010, and consumer lending grew more than 23% for lending for car loans, personal loans, and payroll loans. Also, mortgage loans are growing, at around 6%, because the population has become better educated. We are providing one out of three new mortgages in the private sector market, including banks and specialized companies. I would say, across the board, we see very healthy growth because the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) is relatively stable in all of our markets.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico is a country that is growing very fast in terms of access to credit and banking services."</div><h4>How would you rate the development of electronic banking in Mexico?</h4><p>In general, I would say it is very important that Mexico improves electronic banking. The payment system is relatively underdeveloped—too much cash, too many checks. The problem is we have a large customer base trained to use cash and checks. Now it's easier with small companies and new customers, as young people adopt new technologies well. But still, there is a challenge to make the economy more electronic. Not just in banking, but in all the economy's transactions. The government also uses too much cash and too many checks. We are working toward designing fully electronic solutions that are convenient for the customer. Internet banking has grown significantly, especially in the SME sector, because all of our credit programs are designed to be used on the internet. The government also introduced a positive measure that requires all companies to pay their taxes through the internet. That is also helping with internet adoption rates. I think internet banking is important, but mobile banking is also going to be very significant.</p><h4>What are your main investment plans for 2012?</h4><p>We are constructing two new buildings in Mexico City. In addition to that, we are investing in a new business model. We are making very significant changes to our business model, product distribution methods, and the way we advise and interact with customers. We are also investing in infrastructure. We are opening new branches, but more importantly we are investing in new technology, and new electronic channels. We are installing many point-of-sale (POS) systems for our correspondent merchants, and have around 14,000 at present.</p><h4>Compared to other Latin American countries, the bank penetration rate in Mexico is quite low. Is the dominance of the informal sector the reason for this?</h4><p>The problem is very simple; we are 20 years behind. When Chile and Brazil's credit penetration was growing, Mexico's banks were being nationalized. We lost 10 years in the 1980s, and we faced a crisis in the 1990s after the sector was privatized. Credit almost fell to zero over this period. Currently, Mexico is experiencing one of the most dynamic banking penetration processes in the world. Banking systems have grown significantly over the past seven years to include 42 million customers, up from 22 million. There are also now 500,000 companies with credit, up from 100,000 in the past five years. The base is low compared to other countries, but the dynamics are strong in this healthy banking system. It is very important that this growth is sustainable in the future. We have a system with over a 15% capital adequacy ratio (CAR). It is a very liquid market and a very liquid position for Bancomer. There are, however, some challenges that we need to overcome to grow more, and the informal economy is one of them. It is very difficult to assess the financial capacity of these companies or families. The legal framework has improved, but needs more improvement. The rights that we have as creditors in our loan operations when we need to recover guarantees are very slow processes. In general, the rule of law needs to be more efficient and effective in protecting these rights for the benefit of everybody, especially the investors. Despite that, the environment is very attractive.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the bank and your presence in the region?</h4><p>Lombard Odier is one of the few true remaining private banks in the world as it is owned by a group of partners, of which I am a limited one. The vast majority of other banks have become subsidiaries of larger institutions. The bank was founded in 1796 and today has around $150 billion in assets under management. We have 24 offices in 17 countries, including the world's main financial centers, such as Singapore, London, Amsterdam, and so on. We are a discreet bank with a local appeal. We perform only one job, which is to manage wealth. By wealth, I essentially mean cash. There are two sides to this; firstly we manage wealth for institutions like pension or sovereign wealth funds. Secondly, there are private individuals and families, which historically have been our area of specialism. Out of this $150 billion that we manage, 70% is from private families and individuals, which makes us unique compared to other private banks. We have been working in the Middle East for around 50 years, originally in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and then progressively we have extended our presence. We have some very strong links in the area with clients stretching over a few generations. Until five years ago we were only catering to people from Switzerland, essentially from Geneva or in certain instances from London, as they were not so keen on having an office in the region because we are not a commercial or corporate bank, and we should be discreet. Clients historically came to visit us or we would come to them. However, this situation changed when we established a representative office in Dubai, in 2007.</p><h4>What, then, were the factors that motivated the bank to establish a presence in Dubai?</h4><p>Today I am meeting more and more clients who want us to be with them and guide them through the turmoil in Europe. For this reason we need to be close to our clients. We are like a small specialist clinic, with a select group of expert employees who know everything about their clients, across generations. The new generation is now emerging here and is expecting much more from its private bankers, and demanding more than a banker continuously travelling back and forth. We traditionally had a number of discretionary mandates, where the client was more passive, choosing to delegate responsibility and discussing only how much risk to take. The new generation is more active in the whole process, and they want to have a say at every stage. They want someone to manage the wealth, but they want to be consulted, to get involved, and be able to take decisions. Today, I am the first partner to relocate here for an extended period as we believe the Middle East has a crucial role to play in the upcoming years. It is right in the middle of the Fertile Crescent between Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Central Asia. For many reasons, Europe has been slowing down. It has become more complicated to conduct business activities there due to social laws, unions, and other factors. Coming to the Middle East is easy, and there are of course tax benefits. The markets here have already emerged and are attracting a larger and larger amount of attention.</p><div class="quote">“The new generation is now emerging here and is expecting much more from its private bankers."</div><h4>What significance does the UAE hold in terms of the wider region banking industry?</h4><p>During the boom years here in the UAE, as part of the ruler's vision, investment was largely directed toward infrastructure development. We are not talking about speculation here, but real solid businesses such as ports and so on. People saw the speculation and the bubble, but underneath that the government was working very hard to build solid foundations. Today this is very much starting to pay off, and is positioning the area as a key place to access the surrounding regions. Dubai has also developed superb infrastructure and this is boosting economic growth, making our presence here even more resonant. For the Indian subcontinent you can say that the UAE is becoming like Hong Kong; a base for the family as well as the business—there is a trading platform here. Many banks have been leaving at a time when I believe it is in fact the right moment to establish a strong presence. The Middle East is becoming a major partner for the world, and especially for the growing world. We are a long-term-oriented private bank and we are here to capture some part of the growth.</p><h4>What is the core client focus and what differentiates Lombard Odier?</h4><p>Typically, clients approach banks for wealth management services with wealth, on average, just under $1 million. For us, our clients have an average wealth management need of around $10 million. We represent some younger generation family clients for smaller amounts, right up to our largest clients who have several billion dollars. There is a large range. Our clients do not expect us to take risks on our balance sheets, and that is a differentiating factor for us. We are very conservative, and do not run an investment banking or proprietary trading business. We also do not finance real estate. For these reasons, we define ourselves by two characteristics: first, our solid, conservative, risk averse, long-term, family-orientated, and discreet approach; and second, our strong belief that we do not follow the business models of banks that have tried to be a one-stop-shop system doing everything from retail to investment banking. Being a one-stop shop can appear to be good for the client, but ultimately it can dilute quality. We have one core function and we do it well, which in these times of geo-political and financial uncertainty is more important than ever.</p><h4>What's your perception of Dubai's recovery since the global economic crisis?</h4><p>The private sector is still short of cash, but it is recovering. Businesses are starting to do better, but we're still in a gray area. Dubai is still recovering from the real estate bust, and in Abu Dhabi people have been more conservative. It is still not business as usual, but there is more cash and more room for investment. Dubai is also on the way up.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Turkey to UK business?</h4><p>It's very important. The relationship has taken a great step forward in the last eight months or so, partly because of the new information partnership and partly due to the state visit of President Gül, and my own visit with a business delegation; I was the first Business Secretary to visit Turkey for 10 years. On the ground, UK exports are up nearly 30% and imports from Turkey up by around 10% in the last year. It's one of the areas of rapid growth of trade and business generally, something that we have committed to strengthening in the future as part of our strategic partnership. We are committed to doubling bilateral trade by 2015 and we're well on track to achieve that.</p><h4>How would you characterize economic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>I think you can legitimately criticize the UK for not having paid more attention to Turkey's emergence as a highly successful economy and a very successful democracy. Both of those things are now apparent. While this may not have been fully appreciated in the past decade, a lot of work has been going on to build a relationship with Turkey. The most important issue, which was brought to the forefront by the previous government and is a position maintained by the current UK government, is our support for Turkey's accession to the EU, which hasn't been so popular with other European countries. However, we continue to make the case for Turkey's membership.</p><div class="quote">“UK exports are up nearly 30% and imports from Turkey up by around 10% in the last year."</div><h4>What would be the impact of Turkey's accession to the EU for British business?</h4><p>It would be good for Turkey, and it would be good for the UK. It would remove a lot of trade barriers in tariffed and non-tariff areas-and it would mean that Turkey would be joining the single market, which is a much more integrated grouping of countries with common standards. Trade would increase very rapidly. There would be a big incentive for investment flows. We're already getting British companies investing in Turkey. There's quite a lot of Turkish capital coming into the UK as well. Once economies become integrated through a customs union or a deeper relationship, then trade and investment flows operate much more substantially.</p><h4>What is the level of integration of British companies in Turkey?</h4><p>I believe there are more than 2,000 British companies investing in Turkey—not just the big names like BP, Shell, and Rolls-Royce, but many smaller companies have moved in—there are several SMEs within the group. When we speak about British SMEs in Turkey, it is mostly the “M" rather than the “S"—there aren't many one-person companies. We're talking about the medium-sized companies, which in many ways are the basis of growth in our economy and in Turkey. One of the reasons that Turkey is such a successful and growing economy is because of the large numbers of entrepreneurs, initially quite small, but who have gone on to grow very rapidly—not just in textiles and traditional sectors, but also in much more sophisticated industries. It's the medium-sized companies where much of the growth and innovation is. One of the things we've realized in Britain is that compared to a country like Germany we haven't done enough to encourage the SME sector in international trade, and my colleague the Trade Minister Lord Green, who has worked on this issue full time, accepts that an absolutely key part of his mandate is to build up trade involving SMEs.</p><h4>Which key trade trends and potential areas for investment can you identify for British firms in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is now a very substantially sized economy. When I visited the country the kind of events I attended, like the Tesco Supplier Academy, suggest the Turkish consumer market is booming. I also went to speak at Sabanci University, which was interested in knowledge transfer and high-tech industries such as IT. I also spoke at the Istanbul Finance Summit on Istanbul's aspirations to become a financial center, and so there is scope for collaboration in financial services as well. It's a pretty wide base of interest, which includes energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and creative industries like fashion.</p><h4>What makes Turkey an attractive partner for British business?</h4><p>Until recently, while Turkey wasn't a closed economy, it was certainly fairly inward looking and protectionist. Over the last decade or so capital barriers to trade and investment have gradually been removed and people have the confidence that this kind of future will continue. The other way that Turkey is attractive as a trading partner is that it is doing a lot of trade with North Africa and the Middle East, and is also looking for partnerships with other developing countries. British companies, not just financial institutions but technical specialists and transport consultants, are working alongside Turkish companies in those countries and this is potentially an area of major business growth. This is very much what I have discussed with Turkish ministers as part of the Strategic Partnership between the UK and Turkey.</p><h4>Can Istanbul become an international financial center?</h4><p>These things don't just happen overnight. Britain's financial sector developed over centuries, going back to refugees coming from Europe in earlier centuries and setting up banking institutions in the city. Then you develop a cluster and trust. It's a difficult thing to force via policy. Saying that, two key ingredients are an open market—a willingness to accept free trade in financial services—and effective regulation; not necessarily bureaucratic, but we've seen in the West, and particularly in the UK, the considerable damage that can happen if banks are allowed to get out of control. The openness and freedom in policy needs to be balanced against effective regulation, particularly in institutions like banks that can cause systemic risk.</p><h4>How can the UK assist Istanbul in achieving its goal?</h4><p>When I was in Turkey, there was a deputation from the City of London called “TheCityUK," which was putting the Istanbul Stock Exchange and people in the market in touch with people with expertise and building up networks based on contacts that have the best way of helping. The other way this happens is that other British financial institutions, not just banks, but if insurance companies invest in Turkey and then they become part of this financial services sector. I don't see why we won't see an increase of these types of institutions investing in Turkey. Companies want a mixture of things: they want market freedom, a system of regulation that's effective and transparent, and to be part of a successful economy. And Turkey is certainly all that, and there is a role for overseas financial institutions to help build up savings in Turkey, so the key elements are there.</p><h4>The UK and Turkey have committed to doubling Turkish-British bilateral trade by 2015. What is the strategy to achieve this?</h4><p>We will have many more visits between the two countries—not just ministers, but trade missions and missions with not just the big names, but with SMEs too. That is the way that as a government we can foster these things. We're also developing our knowledge partnership. The plan is to get more British universities linked up with Turkish institutions and encourage not just commercial innovators, but academics, scientists, technicians, and people interested in innovation and getting more of a transfer going between the two countries—more Turkish people coming to the UK and more British academics and scientists going to Turkey. That is something we are actively trying to promote. We just hope that our respective economies manage their current difficulties and continue to offer good growth prospects. There is a bit of a cloud hanging over Europe generally, but we hope it is properly managed and doesn't get in the way of either Turkish or British growth. The British currency has been flexible, being out of the euro zone. In the short term, there are benefits in being outside the euro, but in 10 or 15 years people may take a different view about euro membership, but definitely in the short term there are benefits and advantages in the flexibility we have by remaining on the outside.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>
